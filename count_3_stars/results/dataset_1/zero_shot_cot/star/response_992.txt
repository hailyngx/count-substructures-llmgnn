Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.
In this graph, nodes 2, 5, and 6 are each connected to 3 other nodes. These nodes will be the centers of the 3-stars.

Step 2: For each of these nodes, find the sets of 3 nodes that are connected to them.
For node 2: (0, 8, 5) and (5, 0, 8)
For node 5: (2, 4, 8) and (4, 2, 8)
For node 6: (2, 3, 4) and (3, 2, 4)

Step 3: List the unique 3-stars.
<2, (0, 8, 5)>
<5, (2, 4, 8)>
<6, (2, 3, 4)>

Step 4: Count the number of unique 3-stars found.
