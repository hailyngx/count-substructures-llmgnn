Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's look at each node and determine the 3-stars:

1. Node 0:
   - <0, (2, 5, 0)>
   - <0, (5, 3, 0)>

2. Node 1:
   - <1, (3, 8, 1)>

3. Node 2:
   - <2, (0, 3, 2)>
   - <2, (3, 9, 2)>

4. Node 3:
   - <3, (1, 2, 3)>
   - <3, (2, 5, 3)>

5. Node 4:
   No 3-stars for Node 4.

6. Node 5:
   - <5, (0, 3, 5)>
   - <5, (3, 7, 5)>

7. Node 6:
   No 3-stars for Node 6.

8. Node 7:
   No 3-stars for Node 7.

9. Node 8:
   No 3-stars for Node 8.

10. Node 9:
   No 3-stars for Node 9.

Count of 3-stars: [6]

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (2, 5, 0)>
<0, (5, 3, 0)>
<1, (3, 8, 1)>
<2, (0, 3, 2)>
<2, (3, 9, 2)>
<5, (0, 3, 5)>
