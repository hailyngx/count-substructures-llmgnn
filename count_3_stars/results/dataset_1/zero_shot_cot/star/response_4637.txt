Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central node and its adjacent nodes in each 3-star in the graph. 

We have the following 3-stars:
<0, (2, 7, 1)>
<1, (2, 3, 8)>
<1, (3, 8, 9)>
<2, (0, 1, 7)>
<3, (1, 7, 9)>
<5, (8, 9, 9)>
<7, (0, 3, 9)>
<8, (1, 5, 9)>
<9, (1, 3, 5)>

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars.
