Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the graph. 
From the given edges, the nodes {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9} are present.
Thus, the potential central nodes are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph with the given information.
To form a 3-star, the center node needs to be connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's calculate this step by step.

1. Central node 0:
   - Connected to nodes: 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8
   - Possible 3-stars:
     - <0, (1, 4, 6)>
     - <0, (1, 7, 8)>

2. Central node 1:
   - Connected to nodes: 0, 8
   - No 3-star can be formed as it doesn't have three connections.

3. Central node 2:
   - Connected to nodes: 0, 3, 4, 9
   - No 3-star can be formed as it doesn't have three connections.

4. Central node 3:
   - Connected to nodes: 2, 4, 5
   - Possible 3-stars:
     - <3, (2, 4, 5)>

5. Central node 4:
   - Connected to nodes: 0, 2, 3
   - Possible 3-stars:
     - <4, (0, 2, 3)>

6. Central node 5:
   - Connected to nodes: 3, 7, 8
   - No 3-star can be formed as it doesn't have three connections.

7. Central node 6: 
   - Connected to nodes: 0, 9
   - No 3-star can be formed as it doesn't have three connections.

8. Central node 7:
   - Connected to nodes: 0, 5, 9
   - No 3-star can be formed as it doesn't have three connections.

9. Central node 8:
   - Connected to nodes: 0, 1, 5
   - No 3-star can be formed as it doesn't have three connections.

10. Central node 9:
    - Connected to nodes: 2, 6, 7
    - No 3-star can be formed as it doesn't have three connections.

Thus, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].  
The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (1, 4, 6)>, <0, (1, 7, 8)>.
