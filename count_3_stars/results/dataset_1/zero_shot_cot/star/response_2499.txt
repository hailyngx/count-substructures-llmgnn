Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (9, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify the central node of each 3-star.  
In a 3-star, the central node is connected to exactly three other nodes.  
From the given edges, the possible central nodes are 0, 4, and 7.

Step 2: Find all 3-stars with the central nodes identified.  
For central node 0:  
- <0, (2, 5)>  
For central node 4:  
- <4, (3, 5, 6)>  
- <4, (3, 7, 6)>  
- <4, (5, 6, 7)>  
- <4, (5, 7, 6)>  
For central node 7:  
- <7, (3, 4, 5)>  

Step 3: Count the total number of 3-stars.  
There are 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph.
