Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star in the graph. 

Given the edge list, we can identify the 3-stars as follows:

1. Node 2, (3, 4, 8)
2. Node 3, (1, 2, 6)
3. Node 5, (8, 9, 2)
4. Node 6, (0, 3, 7)
5. Node 8, (2, 4, 6)
6. Node 9, (2, 5, 8)

Count of 3-stars: [6]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
