Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are three 3-stars in the given graph. 

Therefore, the answer is [3].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<1, (2, 3, 5)>
<9, (4, 7, 1)>
