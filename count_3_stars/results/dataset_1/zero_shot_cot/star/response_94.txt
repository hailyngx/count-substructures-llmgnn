Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify all 3-stars in the given graph:  
- From node 0: (0, 1, 5), (0, 6, 7)
- From node 1: (1, 0, 5), (1, 2, 6)
- From node 2: (2, 1, 5), (2, 3, 6)
- From node 3: (3, 2, 9)
- From node 4: (4, 6, 8)
- From node 5: (5, 0, 1), (5, 2, 6)
- From node 6: (6, 0, 1), (6, 2, 5), (6, 4, 7)
- From node 7: (7, 0, 6)
- From node 8: (8, 4, 6)
- From node 9: (9, 2, 3)

So, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are:  
<0, (1, 5, 6)>  
<0, (6, 7, 1)>  
<1, (0, 5, 2)>  
<1, (2, 6, 0)>   
<2, (1, 5, 6)>  
<2, (3, 6, 1)>  
<3, (2, 9, 6)>  
<4, (6, 8, 4)>  
<5, (0, 1, 2)>  
<5, (2, 6, 0)>  
<6, (0, 1, 2)>  
<6, (2, 5, 1)>  
<6, (4, 7, 0)>  
<7, (0, 6, 1)>  
<8, (4, 6, 8)>  
<9, (2, 3, 6)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].
