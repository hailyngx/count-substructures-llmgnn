Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The process to find the number of 3-stars in the graph can be broken down into the following steps:

1. Identify nodes that are connected to exactly 3 other nodes.
2. For each identified node, create a 3-star by considering it as the center and the 3 nodes it is connected to as leaves.
3. Count the unique 3-stars formed.
4. Output the result in brackets [].

Let's start the process step-by-step:

Step 1: Identify nodes with 3 connections:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 7, and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 6.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 5.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 8, and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 8.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 6.

Step 2: Create 3-stars with the identified nodes as centers and their connected nodes as leaves:
- <0, (1, 3, 7)>
- <0, (1, 3, 9)>
- <1, (0, 2, 6)>
- <2, (1, 4, 5)>
- <3, (0, 4, 8)>
- <9, (0, 3, 6)>

Step 3: Count the unique 3-stars: 6

Step 4: Output the result: [6]

Therefore, the number of unique 3-stars in the given graph is 6.
