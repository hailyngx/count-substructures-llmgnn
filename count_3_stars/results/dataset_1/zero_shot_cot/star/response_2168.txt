Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to each node in the graph.

Node 0: 1, 3, 5, 7
Node 1: 0, 3, 4, 9
Node 2: 3, 4, 5, 6
Node 3: 0, 1, 2, 8
Node 4: 1, 2, 6, 7, 8
Node 5: 0, 2, 6
Node 6: 2, 4, 5
Node 7: 0, 4, 8
Node 8: 3, 4, 7, 9
Node 9: 1, 8

Next, let's find all the 3-stars in this graph:
<0, (1, 3, 7)>
<1, (0, 3, 9)>
<2, (3, 4, 6)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<4, (1, 2, 8)>
<5, (0, 2, 6)>
<6, (2, 4, 5)>
<7, (0, 4, 8)>
<8, (3, 4, 9)>
<9, (1, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
