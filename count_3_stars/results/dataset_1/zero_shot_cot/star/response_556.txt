Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
Let's first identify the central nodes in the graph. The central nodes are nodes that have exactly three neighbors. In this case, since the graph has 10 nodes and each central node is connected to 3 other nodes, there should be a total of 10/4 = 2 central nodes. 

Next, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. We will list them in the format <center, (leaf1, leaf2, leaf3)>.

Based on the given edges, the possible 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 6, 8)>
<1, (0, 2, 5)>
<4, (6, 9, -)>
<6, (0, 1, 4)>
<6, (4, 7, -)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
