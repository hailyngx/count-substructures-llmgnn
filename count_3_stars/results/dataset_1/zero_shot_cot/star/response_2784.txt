Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 4, 8
2. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 8, 5
3. Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 6, 8
4. Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 9, 8
5. Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 5, 8
6. Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 8, 1
7. Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 9, 8
8. Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 8, 5
9. Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 4, 5
10. Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 6, 8

So, there are a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph.

<0, (5, 4, 8)>, <1, (4, 8, 5)>, <2, (9, 6, 8)>, <3, (6, 9, 8)>, <4, (1, 5, 8)>, <5, (4, 8, 1)>, <6, (3, 9, 8)>, <7, (4, 8, 5)>, <8, (1, 4, 5)>, <9, (2, 6, 8)>
