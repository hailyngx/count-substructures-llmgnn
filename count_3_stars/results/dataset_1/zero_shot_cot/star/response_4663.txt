Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we need to identify the 3-star patterns in the graph.

Let's list out the possible 3-stars:

<0, (2, 4, 9)>
<2, (0, 8, -)>
<4, (0, 7, -)>
<7, (1, 4, 5)>
<8, (2, 5, 9)>
<9, (0, 8, -)>

Now, we count the number of occurrences of each unique 3-star pattern:

<0, (2, 4, 9)> appears 1 time
<2, (0, 8, -)> appears 1 time
<4, (0, 7, -)> appears 1 time
<7, (1, 4, 5)> appears 1 time
<8, (2, 5, 9)> appears 1 time
<9, (0, 8, -)> appears 1 time

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
