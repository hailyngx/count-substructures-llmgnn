Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (4, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will be the centers of the 3-stars. 

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Central node: 0
   Leaves: 1, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9
   <0, (1, 6, 7)>
   <0, (1, 8, 9)>
   <0, (4, 6, 7)>
   <0, (6, 5, 7)>
   <0, (7, 5, 8)>
   <0, (8, 1, 9)>

2. Central node: 1
   Leaves: 0, 2, 8, 9
   <1, (0, 8, 9)>
   <1, (2, 5, 8)>
   <1, (8, 5, 0)>
   <1, (9, 0, 8)>

3. Central node: 5
   Leaves: 2, 6, 7, 8
   <5, (2, 6, 8)>
   <5, (6, 0, 8)>
   <5, (7, 0, 8)>
   <5, (8, 0, 1)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].  
The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (1, 6, 7)>, <0, (1, 8, 9)>, <0, (4, 6, 7)>, <0, (6, 5, 7)>, <0, (7, 5, 8)>, <0, (8, 1, 9)>, <1, (0, 8, 9)>, <1, (2, 5, 8)>, <1, (8, 5, 0)>, <1, (9, 0, 8)>, <5, (2, 6, 8)>, <5, (6, 0, 8)>, <5, (7, 0, 8)>, <5, (8, 0, 1)>
