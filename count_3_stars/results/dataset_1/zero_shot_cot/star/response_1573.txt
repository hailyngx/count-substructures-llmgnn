Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the central nodes and their adjacent nodes. 

From the edges provided, we can see the following connections:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 4 and 7
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 6, 7, and 8
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 7
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 8
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 3 and 8
- Node 6 is connected to node 2
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 3
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 5

Now, let's count the 3-stars:

<1, (4, 7, -)>  
<2, (6, 7, 8)>  
<3, (4, 5, 7)>  
<4, (1, 3, 8)>  
<5, (3, 8, -)>  

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
