Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

Starting with node 0:
- Node 0 is connected to 2 nodes: 8 and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to 4 nodes: 0, 1, 3, and 9. Ignoring the edge to node 0 to avoid repetition.
- Node 9 is connected to 3 nodes: 0, 4, and 6. Ignoring the edge to node 0 to avoid repetition.

Therefore, there is 1 3-star with center at node 0: <0, (8, 9)>.

Moving on to other nodes:
- Node 1 is connected to 3 nodes: 4, 7, and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to 3 nodes: 1, 5, and 9. Ignoring the edge to node 1 to avoid repetition.
- Node 9 is connected to 3 nodes: 0, 4, and 6. Ignoring the edge to node 0 to avoid repetition.

Therefore, there is 1 3-star with center at node 1: <1, (4, 7, 8)>.

In total, there are [2] unique 3-stars in the given graph: <0, (8, 9)> and <1, (4, 7, 8)>.
