Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 44 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's find them step-by-step.

1. Node 0 is connected to 2 other nodes.
2. Node 1 is connected to 5 other nodes.
3. Node 2 is connected to another 3 nodes.
4. Node 3 is connected to 5 other nodes.
5. Node 4 is connected to 4 other nodes.
6. Node 5 is connected to 2 other nodes.
7. Node 6 is connected to 4 other nodes.
8. Node 7 is connected to 5 other nodes.
9. Node 8 is connected to 4 other nodes.
10. Node 9 is connected to 5 other nodes.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:

- <0, (2, 9, 1)>
- <2, (0, 9, 8)>
- <6, (1, 9, 4)>
- <8, (1, 2, 3)>
- <9, (0, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
