Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 

First, let's go node by node and check how many edges each node has:

- Node 0: 4 edges
- Node 1: 2 edges
- Node 2: 3 edges
- Node 3: 5 edges
- Node 4: 1 edge
- Node 5: 1 edge
- Node 6: 3 edges
- Node 7: 5 edges
- Node 8: 4 edges
- Node 9: 2 edges

Since a 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can see that only nodes 0, 3, 6, and 7 have the possibility of being the center nodes of 3-stars.

Let's list the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<0, (3, 1, 6)>
<0, (5, 0, 6)>
<0, (6, 7, 8)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<3, (1, 0, 2)>
<3, (2, 7, 4)>
<3, (4, 7, 9)>
<6, (0, 7, 8)>
<6, (7, 0, 8)>
<6, (8, 7, 9)>
<7, (2, 3, 4)>
<7, (3, 2, 4)>
<7, (4, 3, 9)>
<7, (9, 8, 2)>
<7, (8, 6, 9)>
<7, (6, 8, 9)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we get a total of [17].
