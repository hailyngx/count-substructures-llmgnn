Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
Let's first identify all the 3-stars in the given graph.

The possible 3-stars can be:
1. <0, (3, 4, 6)>
2. <1, (2, 4, 5)>
3. <2, (1, 4, 5)>
4. <3, (0, 1, 4)>
5. <4, (0, 1, 2)>
6. <6, (0, 4, 7)>
7. <7, (6, 8, 0)>
8. <8, (2, 3, 7)>
9. <9, (1, 3, 4)>

Therefore, there are 9 unique 3-stars in the given graph. So, the final answer is [9].
