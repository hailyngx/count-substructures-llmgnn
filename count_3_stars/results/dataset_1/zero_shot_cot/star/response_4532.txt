Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Looking at the given edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<1, (0, 5, 7)>
<5, (1, 4, 6)>
<6, (0, 4, 5)>
<7, (0, 1, 3)>
<8, (1, 2, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
