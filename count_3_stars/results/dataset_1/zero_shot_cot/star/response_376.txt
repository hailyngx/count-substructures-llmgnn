Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars, we need to find all possible combinations where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph step by step:

1. Nodes connected to node 0: {4}
   - <0, (4, x, x)> [x can be any node other than 4 because it's already connected to node 0]

2. Nodes connected to node 1: {3, 6}
   - <1, (3, 6, x)> [x can be any node other than 3 and 6 because they are already connected to node 1]

3. Nodes connected to node 2: {7}
   - <2, (7, x, x)> [x can be any node other than 7 because it's already connected to node 2]

4. Nodes connected to node 3: {1, 8, 9}
   - <3, (1, 8, 9)>

5. Nodes connected to node 4: {0, 5, 6}
   - <4, (0, 5, 6)>

6. Nodes connected to node 5: {4}
   - <5, (4, x, x)> [x can be any node other than 4 because it's already connected to node 5]

7. Nodes connected to node 6: {1, 4, 7}
   - <6, (1, 4, 7)>

8. Nodes connected to node 7: {2, 6}
   - <7, (2, 6, x)> [x can be any node other than 2 and 6 because they are already connected to node 7]

9. Nodes connected to node 8: {3, 9}
   - <8, (3, 9, x)> [x can be any node other than 3 and 9 because they are already connected to node 8]

10. Nodes connected to node 9: {3, 8}
   - <9, (3, 8, x)> [x can be any node other than 3 and 8 because they are already connected to node 9]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9]. 
Here are the unique 3-stars in the graph: 
<0, (4, x, x)>
<1, (3, 6, x)>
<2, (7, x, x)>
<3, (1, 8, 9)>
<4, (0, 5, 6)>
<5, (4, x, x)>
<6, (1, 4, 7)>
<7, (2, 6, x)>
<8, (3, 9, x)>
<9, (3, 8, x)>
