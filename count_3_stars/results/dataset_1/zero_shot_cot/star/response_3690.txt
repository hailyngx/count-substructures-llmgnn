Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify the central node and its connected nodes in each 3-star.

Let's begin by looking at each node as a potential central node and list its adjacent nodes:

- Node 0: (3, 4)
- Node 1: (3, 6, 7)
- Node 2: (3, 6)
- Node 3: (0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 9)
- Node 4: (0, 3, 8)
- Node 5: (3, 6, 9)
- Node 6: (1, 2, 5, 8, 9)
- Node 7: (1)
- Node 8: (4, 6, 9)
- Node 9: (3, 5, 6, 8)

Now, let's identify the 3-stars by looking at nodes that have exactly 3 adjacent nodes connected to them:

<0, (3, 4)>
<1, (3, 6, 7)>
<2, (3, 6)>
<4, (0, 3, 8)>
<7, (1)>
<5, (3, 6, 9)>
<8, (4, 6, 9)>
<9, (3, 5, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
