Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where the conditions of a 3-star graph are satisfied. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Identify the central node and its neighbors:
   - Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 7, and 9.
   - Node 1 is connected to nodes 7 and 8.
   - Node 2 is connected to nodes 0 and 5.
   - Node 3 is connected to nodes 6 and 8.
   - Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 8.
   - Node 6 is connected to nodes 3 and 8.
   - Node 7 is connected to nodes 0 and 1.
   - Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 5, 6, and 9.
   - Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 8.

2. Find 3-stars:
   - <0, (2, 5, 7)>
   - <0, (2, 5, 9)>
   - <0, (5, 7, 9)>
   - <3, (6, 8, 9)>
   - <5, (0, 2, 8)>
   - <5, (2, 0, 8)>
   - <5, (0, 8, 9)>
   - <5, (2, 8, 9)>
   - <8, (1, 3, 9)>
   - <8, (3, 1, 9)>

3. Count the total number of 3-stars: [9]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
