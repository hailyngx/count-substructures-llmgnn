Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, which has 10 nodes and 26 edges, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern.

Let's start by listing all the 3-star patterns:
<0, (2, 5, 7)>
<1, (2, 3, 8)>
<2, (0, 1, 6)>
<3, (1, 8, 6)>
<4, (5, 7, 9)>
<5, (0, 4, 7)>
<6, (2, 3, 8)>
<7, (0, 4, 5)>
<8, (3, 6, 2)>
<9, (4, 5, 7)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph:
[10]
