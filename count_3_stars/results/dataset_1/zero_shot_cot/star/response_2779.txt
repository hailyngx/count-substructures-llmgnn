Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 2) (4, 8) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars in the graph.

Let's start by listing the 3-stars in the graph:  
<1, (0, 7, 8)>  
<1, (0, 8, 9)>  
<1, (7, 8, 9)>  
<8, (1, 4, 9)>

Now, we can count the total number of 3-stars in the graph.
