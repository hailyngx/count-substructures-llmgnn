Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 4) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph.

Nodes with their neighbors:
- Node 0: 2, 5, 7, 8
- Node 1: 2, 6
- Node 2: 0, 1, 8
- Node 3: 4
- Node 4: 3
- Node 5: 0, 9
- Node 6: 1, 8, 9
- Node 7: 0
- Node 8: 0, 2, 6
- Node 9: 5, 6

Now let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:

The 3-star centered at each node:
- Node 0: (2, 5, 7), (2, 5, 8)
- Node 1: (2, 6, 8)
- Node 2: (0, 1, 8), (0, 8, 6)
- Node 3: None
- Node 4: None
- Node 5: (0, 9, 6)
- Node 6: (1, 8, 0), (8, 6, 9), (8, 6, 9)
- Node 7: None
- Node 8: (0, 2, 6)
- Node 9: None

So, the unique 3-stars in the graph are:
<0, (2, 5, 7)>, <0, (2, 5, 8)>, <1, (2, 6, 8)>, <2, (0, 1, 8)>, <2, (0, 8, 6)>, <5, (0, 9, 6)>, <6, (1, 8, 0)>, <6, (8, 6, 9)>
  
There are total [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
