Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the possible combinations where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Looking at the edges provided, we can identify the following 3-stars:
1. <0, (1, 2, 3)>
2. <0, (1, 4, 6)>
3. <0, (2, 3, 9)>
4. <3, (0, 5, 6)>
5. <3, (5, 8, 9)>
6. <2, (0, 6, 9)>
7. <6, (2, 3, 7)>
8. <9, (2, 3, 5)>

Therefore, there are a total of **8** 3-stars in the given graph.  
So, the final answer is: **[8]**.
