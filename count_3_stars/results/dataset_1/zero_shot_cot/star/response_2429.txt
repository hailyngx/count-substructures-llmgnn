Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 9) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0: (0, 7, 9)
2. Node 1: (1, 3, 9)
3. Node 3: (3, 1, 9)
4. Node 5: (5, 6, 9)
5. Node 6: (6, 5, 9)
6. Node 7: (7, 0, 8)
7. Node 8: (8, 7, 9)
8. Node 9: (9, 0, 1)
9. Node 9: (9, 1, 3)
10. Node 9: (9, 3, 5)
11. Node 9: (9, 5, 8)
12. Node 9: (9, 8, 0)

Therefore, there are a total of [12] 3-stars in the given graph.

<0, (7, 9, 0)>, 
<1, (3, 9, 1)>,
<3, (1, 9, 3)>,
<5, (6, 9, 5)>,
<6, (5, 9, 6)>,
<7, (0, 8, 7)>,
<8, (7, 9, 8)>,
<9, (0, 1, 9)>,
<9, (1, 3, 9)>,
<9, (3, 5, 9)>,
<9, (5, 8, 9)>,
<9, (8, 0, 9)>
