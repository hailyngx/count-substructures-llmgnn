Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0 forms a 3-star: <0, (4, 7, 9)>
2. Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (4, 5, 6)>
3. Node 4 forms two 3-stars: <4, (0, 8, 9)> and <4, (1, 8, 9)>
4. Node 5 forms three 3-stars: <5, (1, 2, 7)>, <5, (4, 7, 8)>, and <5, (8, 9, 7)>
5. Node 9 forms a 3-star: <9, (0, 4, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
