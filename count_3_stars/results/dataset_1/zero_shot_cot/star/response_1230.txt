Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 6) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique set of nodes that form a 3-star. 

Given the definition of a 3-star, we know that the center node will have exactly 3 neighboring nodes.

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (3, 7, 9)>
<3, (0, 6, 7)>
<7, (0, 3, 4)>
<5, (2, 4, 8)>
<9, (3, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
