Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's first identify the 3-star configurations in the given graph. 

1. <0, (7, 9)>
2. <1, (2, 5, 7)>
3. <2, (1, 6)>
4. <3, (7, 9)>
5. <4, (5, 6, 9)>
6. <5, (1, 4, 6, 7)>
7. <6, (2, 4, 5, 7)>
8. <7, (0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9)>
9. <8, (7)>
10. <9, (0, 3, 4, 7)>

There are a total of 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph, so the final answer is [10].
