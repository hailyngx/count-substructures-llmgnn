Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify all the 3-stars present:

1. <0, (5, 6, 8)>
2. <0, (5, 6, 9)>
3. <0, (5, 8, 9)>
4. <0, (6, 8, 9)>
5. <1, (4, 8, _)>
6. <2, (6, 8, 9)>
7. <3, (8, _, _)>
8. <4, (1, 8, _)>

Now, count the number of unique 3-stars: [8].
