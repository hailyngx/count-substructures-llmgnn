Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will be the potential centers of 3-stars. 
Based on the given edges, the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes are: 2, 4, 5, and 8.

Now, we will look for 3-stars in the graph. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through each potential center node and see if they form a 3-star. 

For node 2:
- <2, (1, 3, 4)>
- <2, (3, 4, 5)>
- <2, (4, 5, 8)>
- <2, (1, 3, 8)>
  
For node 4:
- <4, (0, 2, 5)>
- <4, (2, 5, 8)>
- <4, (0, 2, 8)>

For node 5:
- <5, (2, 4, 8)>
- <5, (2, 8, 9)>
- <5, (4, 8, 9)>

For node 8:
- <8, (2, 5, 9)>
- <8, (5, 7, 9)>
- <8, (2, 7, 9)>

After checking all potential center nodes, we can see that there are a total of 12 unique 3-stars in the graph. 

Therefore, the final answer is [12].
