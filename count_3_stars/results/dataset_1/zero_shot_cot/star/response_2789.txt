Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- Central node: 0
  Leaves: 7, 8

- Central node: 1
  Leaves: 3, 5, 8

- Central node: 3
  Leaves: 1, 6, 8

- Central node: 4
  Leaves: 2, 5, 7

- Central node: 5
  Leaves: 1, 4, 8

- Central node: 7
  Leaves: 0, 4, 9

- Central node: 8
  Leaves: 0, 1, 3, 5

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7], and the unique 3-stars are <0, (7, 8)>, <1, (3, 5, 8)>, <3, (1, 6, 8)>, <4, (2, 5, 7)>, <5, (1, 4, 8)>, <7, (0, 4, 9)>, <8, (0, 1, 3, 5)>.
