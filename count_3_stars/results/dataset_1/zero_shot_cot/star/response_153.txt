Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can start by identifying the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes through edges. These nodes can act as the center of a 3-star.

Nodes with 3 connections: 1, 2, 4, 7, 9

Now, we can construct the unique 3-stars based on these central nodes:

<1, (5, 7, 8)>
<2, (3, 5, 6)>
<4, (6, 8, -)>
<7, (1, 2, 8)>
<9, (8, -.-.)>

From these unique 3-stars, we can see that there are **5** 3-stars in total.

Therefore, the final answer is **[5]**.
