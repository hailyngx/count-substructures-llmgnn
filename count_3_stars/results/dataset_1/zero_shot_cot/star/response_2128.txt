Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star individually. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (3, 4, 6)>
<1, (4, 5, 7)>
<2, (4, 5, 7)>
<3, (0, 4, 6)>
<4, (0, 1, 2)>
<6, (0, 4, 8)>
<7, (1, 4, 2)>
<8, (2, 6, 4)>
<9, (6, 8, 4)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars found, we get a total of [9].
