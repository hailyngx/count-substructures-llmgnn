Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (4, 9, 5)>
<1, (5, 6, 2)>
<2, (6, 8, 4)>
<3, (5, 9, 0)>
<4, (0, 9, 7)>
<5, (1, 3, 8)>
<6, (1, 2, 7)>
<7, (4, 6, 9)>
<8, (2, 5, 9)>
<9, (0, 3, 7)>

As there are 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph, the final answer is [10].
