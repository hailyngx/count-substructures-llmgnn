Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's first identify all the 3-star structures in the given graph:

<0, (2, 6, 0)>
<2, (0, 6, 4)>
<2, (6, 0, 9)>
<3, (1, 8, 9)>
<5, (6, 9, 7)>
<6, (0, 2, 5)>
<6, (2, 0, 8)>
<6, (5, 9, 8)>
<9, (2, 3, 5)>
<9, (3, 6, 5)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars: [10].
