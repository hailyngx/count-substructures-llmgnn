Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star configurations in the given graph:

1. Node 0: (0, 5), (0, 9), (5, 0), (9, 0)  
   <0, (5, 9)>
   
2. Node 1: (1, 2), (1, 5), (1, 8), (2, 1), (5, 1), (8, 1)  
   <1, (2, 5, 8)>
   
3. Node 3: (3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 9), (6, 3), (7, 3), (9, 3)  
   <3, (6, 7, 9)>
   
4. Node 5: (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 4), (0, 5), (1, 5), (4, 5)  
   <5, (0, 1, 4)>
   
5. Node 6: (6, 3), (6, 8), (3, 6), (8, 6)  
   <6, (3, 8)>
   
6. Node 7: (7, 3), (7, 9), (3, 7), (9, 7)  
   <7, (3, 9)>
   
7. Node 9: (9, 0), (9, 3), (9, 7), (0, 9), (3, 9), (7, 9)  
   <9, (0, 3, 7)>
   
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
