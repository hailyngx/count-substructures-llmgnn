Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify nodes which are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes are potential centers of 3-stars. 
Nodes connected to exactly three other nodes: 0, 8, 6

Next, let's find all the possible 3-stars in the given graph:

1. 3-stars with center node 0:
   <0, (4, 5, 9)>

2. 3-stars with center node 8:
   <8, (1, 5, 7)> 

3. 3-stars with center node 6:
   <6, (1, 9, 7)> 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3]. 
<0, (4, 5, 9)>, <8, (1, 5, 7)>, <6, (1, 9, 7)>
