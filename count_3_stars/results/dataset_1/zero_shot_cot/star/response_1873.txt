Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 9) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's first identify all 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (3, 4, 5)>
2. <0, (4, 5, 6)>
3. <0, (3, 4, 6)>
4. <0, (4, 5, 9)>
5. <0, (5, 6, 9)>
6. <1, (4, 6, 8)>
7. <1, (6, 8, 9)>
8. <1, (8, 9, 4)>
9. <2, (3, 4, 0)>
10. <4, (0, 1, 3)>
11. <4, (0, 1, 2)>
12. <4, (1, 2, 3)>
13. <9, (0, 1, 6)>
14. <9, (1, 6, 8)>
15. <9, (6, 8, 1)>
16. <9, (8, 1, 6)>

Therefore, there are 16 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The total count is [16].
