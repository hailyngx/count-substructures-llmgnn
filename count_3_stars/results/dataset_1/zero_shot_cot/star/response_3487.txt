Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 4) (4, 3) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify which nodes can be the centers of 3-stars. Since a 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes, we need to find nodes with at least three neighbors. From the given edges, we can see that nodes 0, 1, 2, 6, 7, and 8 meet this criteria.

Now, let's examine all possible 3-stars with these potential center nodes:
- For node 0, we have <0, (1, 2, 6)>.
- For node 1, we have <1, (0, 2, 6)>.
- For node 2, we have <2, (0, 1, 6)>.
- For node 6, we have <6, (2, 5, 7)> and <6, (5, 7, 2)>.
- For node 7, we have <7, (6, 8, 6)>.
- For node 8, we have <8, (7, 9, 7)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].  
Thus, the unique 3-stars in the graph are <0, (1, 2, 6)>, <1, (0, 2, 6)>, <2, (0, 1, 6)>, <6, (2, 5, 7)>, <7, (6, 8, 6)>, and <8, (7, 9, 7)>.
