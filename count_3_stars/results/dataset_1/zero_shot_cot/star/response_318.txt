Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes connected to each node:
Node 0: 1, 2, 5, 7, 8
Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 5, 8
Node 2: 0, 1
Node 3: 1, 4, 6, 8, 9
Node 4: 3, 5, 8
Node 5: 0, 1, 4, 9
Node 6: 3, 8
Node 7: 0
Node 8: 0, 1, 3, 4, 6
Node 9: 3, 5

Next, let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:
There are three possible types of 3-stars formations based on the nodes connected to the center node:

1. <0, (1, 2, 5)> - Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 5.
2. <1, (0, 2, 3)> - Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 3.
3. <3, (1, 4, 6)> - Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 6.

Therefore, the [3-star found in the given graph is 3].
