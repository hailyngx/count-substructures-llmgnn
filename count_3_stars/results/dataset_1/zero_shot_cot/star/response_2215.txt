Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
The central node must be connected to exactly three other nodes in order to form a 3-star. Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (1, 9, 3)>
<3, (4, 7, 9)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars in the graph, we find: [2].
