Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's first identify the central nodes in the graph by finding nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them. 

The nodes with three edges connected to them are:
- Node 0 (connected to nodes 1, 2, 6, 7, 8, 9)
- Node 3 (connected to nodes 2, 5, 6)
- Node 7 (connected to nodes 4, 5, 8, 9)

Next, let's determine the 3-stars in the graph by looking at the connections of these central nodes.

- For node 0:
  - <0, (1, 2, 6)>
  - <0, (1, 7, 8)>
  - <0, (2, 3, 6)>
  - <0, (6, 7, 9)>

- For node 3:
  - <3, (2, 5, 6)>

- For node 7:
  - <7, (4, 5, 8)>
  - <7, (5, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7]. The unique 3-stars found are <0, (1, 2, 6)>, <0, (1, 7, 8)>, <0, (2, 3, 6)>, <0, (6, 7, 9)>, <3, (2, 5, 6)>, <7, (4, 5, 8)>, <7, (5, 8, 9)>.
