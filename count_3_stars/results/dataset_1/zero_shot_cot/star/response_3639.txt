Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, which are potential central nodes of 3-stars. Based on the given edges, the nodes that meet this condition are: 0, 2, 4, 6, 9.

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
1. <0, (3, 6, 9)>
2. <2, (4, 6, 9)>
3. <4, (2, 3, 5)>
4. <6, (0, 2, 4)>
5. <9, (1, 2, 3)>

Thus, there are 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
