Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the given graph.

Starting from node 1:
1. Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 6, and 7. This forms a 3-star. <1, (2, 6, 7)>

Moving on to node 2:
2. Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 4. This forms a 3-star. <2, (1, 3, 4)>

Next, let's count the total number of 3-stars:
[2]
