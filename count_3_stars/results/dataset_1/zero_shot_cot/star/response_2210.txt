Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph step-by-step:
1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 5, 8, and 9, but only the edges (0, 3), (0, 4), and (0, 5) form a 3-star centered at node 0. This 3-star is <0, (3, 4, 5)>.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 9, forming a 3-star <1, (3, 4, 9)>.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 8 and 9, but there is no 3-star centered at node 2.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 6. However, only the edges (3, 0) and (3, 1) contribute to a 3-star at node 3: <3, (0, 1, 6)>.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 5, and 6. Among these, (4, 0), (4, 1), and (4, 5) form another 3-star centered at node 4: <4, (0, 1, 5)>.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0 and 4, but there is no 3-star centered at node 5.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 3 and 4, forming a 3-star <6, (3, 4)>.
8. Node 7 is connected to node 9, but it does not form a 3-star.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 9. Among these edges, (8, 0), (8, 2), and (8, 9) create a 3-star centered at node 8: <8, (0, 2, 9)>.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 7, and 8. The edges (9, 0), (9, 1), and (9, 8) make a 3-star centered at node 9: <9, (0, 1, 8)>.

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 4, 5)>, <1, (3, 4, 9)>, <3, (0, 1, 6)>, <4, (0, 1, 5)>, <6, (3, 4)>, <8, (0, 2, 9)>, <9, (0, 1, 8)>.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
