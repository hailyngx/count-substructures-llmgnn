Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step by step.

1. Identify all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes are potential centers of 3-stars. The nodes connected to exactly three other nodes are: 0, 4, and 5.

2. For each potential center node, list the nodes it is connected to. 

- For node 0: (3, 5, 8, 9)
- For node 4: (1, 3, 5, 9)
- For node 5: (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6)

3. Identify the 3-stars in the graph by considering the center node and its connected nodes.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 5, 8)>
<4, (1, 3, 5)>
<5, (0, 1, 2)>
<5, (3, 4, 6)>

Now, count the total number of 3-stars: [4]
