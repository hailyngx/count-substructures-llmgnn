Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0: (0, 2, 7), (0, 8, 9)  
2. Node 2: (2, 0, 4)  
3. Node 4: (4, 2, 5), (4, 6, 9), (4, 7, 9)  
4. Node 5: (5, 4, 9)  
5. Node 6: (6, 4, 9)  
6. Node 8: (8, 0, 1), (8, 0, 9)  
7. Node 9: (9, 0, 4), (9, 5, 6), (9, 8, 4)  

Counting the 3-stars above, we found a total of 10 unique 3-stars.  
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].  
<0, (2, 7, 0)>, <0, (8, 9, 0)>, <2, (4, 0, 2)>, <4, (2, 5, 4)>, <4, (6, 9, 4)>, <4, (7, 9, 4)>, <5, (9, 4, 5)>, <6, (9, 4, 6)>, <8, (1, 0, 8)>, <8, (9, 0, 8)>
