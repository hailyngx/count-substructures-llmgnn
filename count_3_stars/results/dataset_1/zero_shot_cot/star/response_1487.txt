Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node and its adjacent nodes for each 3-star configuration. 

Given the edges provided, we can list the unique 3-stars as follows:
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<1, (0, 3, 5)>
<2, (6, 7, 8)>
<3, (1, 5, 7)>
<4, (0, 7, 8)>
<5, (0, 1, 3)>
<6, (1, 2, 9)>
<7, (2, 3, 4)>
<8, (1, 3, 4)>
<9, (4, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
