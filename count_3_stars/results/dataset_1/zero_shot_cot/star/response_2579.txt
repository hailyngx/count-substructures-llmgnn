Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that have exactly three edges connecting them to other nodes. These nodes will serve as the centers of the 3-stars.

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 0:  
   -> <0, (1, 2, 6)>
   
2. Node 1:  
   -> <1, (0, 4, 5)>
   
3. Node 2:  
   -> <2, (0, 5, 6)>
   
4. Node 6:  
   -> <6, (0, 2, 9)>
   
5. Node 8:  
   -> <8, (1, 5, 7)>
   
6. Node 9:  
   -> <9, (0, 3, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
