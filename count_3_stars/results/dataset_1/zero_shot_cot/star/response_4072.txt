Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, we can identify the nodes that are connected to the center node in a 3-star configuration. These nodes will have exactly two edges connected to them, with one edge connected to the center node. Then, we can count the number of such configurations to find the total number of 3-stars in the graph.

The nodes that are connected to the center node are: 0, 1, 2, 3, and 8. 

Let's count the number of 3-stars: 
- Node 0 has 2 edges connected to it: (0, 6), (0, 8)
- Node 1 has 2 edges connected to it: (1, 6), (1, 7)
- Node 2 has 2 edges connected to it: (2, 3), (2, 7)
- Node 3 has 2 edges connected to it: (3, 4), (3, 5)
- Node 8 has 2 edges connected to it: (8, 0), (8, 3)

Therefore, there are a total of 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

So, the answer is: [5]

Unique 3-stars: 
<0, (6, 8)>
<1, (6, 7)>
<2, (3, 7)>
<3, (4, 5)>
<8, (0, 3)>
