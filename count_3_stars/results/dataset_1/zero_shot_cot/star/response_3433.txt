Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <1, (2, 4, 7)>
2. <2, (0, 1, 6)>
3. <6, (2, 3, 9)>
4. <7, (1, 5, 9)>
5. <8, (1, 4, 5)>

Counting the number of 3-stars in the graph: [5]
