Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars, we can start by identifying nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will be the centers of the 3-stars.

Upon reviewing the given edges, we find that nodes 0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 8, and 9 are connected to exactly three other nodes. We will now list the unique 3-stars <center, (leaf1, leaf2, leaf3)> for each of these central nodes:

<0, (2, 4, 7)>
<1, (2, 3, 7)>
<3, (1, 5, 9)>
<5, (3, 9, 0)>
<6, (7, 7, 7)>
<8, (7, 7, 7)>
<9, (5, 0, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
