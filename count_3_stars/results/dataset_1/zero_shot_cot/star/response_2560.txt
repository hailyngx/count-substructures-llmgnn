Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will look for each central node and its three connected nodes.

Let's analyze the graph step by step:

1. 3-stars centered at node 0:
    - Node 0 is connected to nodes 5 and 8.
    - <0, (5, 8)> is a 3-star.

2. 3-stars centered at node 1:
    - Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 7.
    - <1, (3, 5, 7)> is a 3-star.

3. 3-stars centered at node 2:
    - Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 9.
    - <2, (4, 5, 9)> is a 3-star.

4. 3-stars centered at node 3:
    - Node 3 is connected to nodes 1 and 8. However, these connections do not form a 3-star.

5. 3-stars centered at node 4:
    - Node 4 is connected to node 2. However, this connection does not form a 3-star.

6. 3-stars centered at node 5:
    - Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 6, and 8.
    - <5, (0, 8, 6)>
    - <5, (1, 2, 8)>
    - <5, (1, 8, 6)>
    - <5, (0, 1, 2)> are the 3-stars.

7. 3-stars centered at node 6:
    - Node 6 is connected to node 5. However, this connection does not form a 3-star.

8. 3-stars centered at node 7:
    - Node 7 is connected to node 1. However, this connection does not form a 3-star.

9. 3-stars centered at node 8:
    - Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 5, and 6. However, none of these combinations form a 3-star.

10. 3-stars centered at node 9:
    - Node 9 is connected to node 2. However, this connection does not form a 3-star.

Hence, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4], and the unique 3-stars found are <0, (5, 8)>, <1, (3, 5, 7)>, <2, (4, 5, 9)>, <5, (0, 8, 6)>, <5, (1, 2, 8)>, <5, (1, 8, 6)>, <5, (0, 1, 2)>.
