Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, which are the potential centers of 3-stars in the graph.

The nodes with connectivity 3 are: 0, 4, 5, and 9.

Let's now list out the unique 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (3, 6, 7)>
<4, (6, 7, 8)>
<5, (2, 3, 8)>

There are a total of [3] unique 3-stars in the graph.
