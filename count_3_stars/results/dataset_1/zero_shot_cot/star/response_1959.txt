Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0: (0, 2), (0, 6), (0, 8) <0, (2, 6, 8)>
2. Node 1: (1, 2), (1, 9) <1, (2, 9, -)>
3. Node 2: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 5), (2, 9) <2, (0, 1, 5)>
4. Node 3: (3, 4), (3, 7) <3, (4, 7, -)>
5. Node 4: (4, 3), (4, 9) <4, (3, 9, -)>
6. Node 5: (5, 2), (5, 7) <5, (2, 7, -)>
7. Node 6: (6, 0), (6, 7) <6, (0, 7, -)>
8. Node 7: (7, 3), (7, 5), (7, 6) <7, (3, 5, 6)>
9. Node 8: (8, 0) <8, (0, -, -)>
10. Node 9: (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 4) <9, (1, 2, 4)>

Hence, there are [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
