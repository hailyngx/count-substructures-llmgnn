Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's first list out the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (6, 8, 9)>
<1, (3, 5, 0)>
<2, (6, 8, 9)>
<3, (1, 6, 0)>
<4, (8, 0, 0)>
<5, (1, 0, 0)>
<6, (0, 2, 3)>
<8, (0, 2, 4)>
<9, (0, 2, 8)>

Now, we count the total number of unique 3-stars: [9]
