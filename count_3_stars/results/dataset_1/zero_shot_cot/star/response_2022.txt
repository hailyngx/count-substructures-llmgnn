Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star structure.

Let's go through the nodes one by one to identify the 3-stars:

1. Node 0: (0, 1, 3, 6, 8) - 3-star: <0, (1, 3, 6)>
2. Node 1: (1, 0, 3, 9) - No 3-star
3. Node 2: (2, 0, 4, 8) - No 3-star
4. Node 3: (3, 0, 1, 6, 8) - 3-star: <3, (0, 1, 6)>
5. Node 4: (4, 2, 5, 7, 9) - No 3-star
6. Node 5: (5, 4, 6, 7) - No 3-star
7. Node 6: (6, 0, 3, 5, 9) - 3-star: <6, (0, 3, 5)>
8. Node 7: (7, 4, 5) - No 3-star
9. Node 8: (8, 0, 2, 3) - No 3-star
10. Node 9: (9, 1, 4, 6) - No 3-star

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (1, 3, 6)>
<3, (0, 1, 6)>
