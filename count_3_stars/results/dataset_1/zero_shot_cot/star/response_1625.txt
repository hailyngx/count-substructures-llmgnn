Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify nodes with exactly 3 edges connected to them.  
In this graph, nodes with exactly 3 edges connected to them are: 2 and 8.

Step 2: For each identified node, check if its neighbors are connected.  
For node 2, its neighbors 0, 1, and 3 are connected forming a 3-star <2, (0, 1, 3)>.

For node 8, its neighbors 0, 3, 4, and 7 are connected forming 3-stars:
- <8, (0, 3, 4)>
- <8, (0, 3, 7)>
- <8, (0, 4, 7)>

Step 3: List unique 3-stars.  
Unique 3-stars found:
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<8, (0, 3, 4)>
<8, (0, 3, 7)>
<8, (0, 4, 7)>

Step 4: Count the number of unique 3-stars.  
There are a total of [4] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
