Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's follow these steps to identify the 3-stars:

1. Identify nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.
2. For each of these nodes, check if the connections form a 3-star.
3. Count the total number of unique 3-stars.

Let's start by identifying the nodes connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 0: Connected to 4, 5, 6, 9 (4 connections)
- Node 1: Connected to 3, 6, 7, 8 (4 connections)
- Node 7: Connected to 1, 2, 3, 4, 9 (5 connections)
- Node 9: Connected to 0, 3, 6, 7 (4 connections)

Now, let's check if these connections form 3-stars:
- Node 0: <0, (4, 5, 6)>, <0, (4, 5, 9)>, <0, (4, 6, 9)>, <0, (5, 6, 9)>
- Node 1: <1, (3, 6, 7)>, <1, (3, 6, 8)>, <1, (3, 7, 8)>, <1, (6, 7, 8)>
- Node 7: <7, (1, 2, 3)>, <7, (1, 3, 4)>, <7, (1, 3, 9)>, <7, (2, 3, 4)>, <7, (3, 4, 9)>
- Node 9: <9, (0, 3, 6)>, <9, (0, 3, 7)>, <9, (0, 6, 7)>, <9, (3, 6, 7)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we get:
- <0, (4, 5, 6)>, <0, (4, 5, 9)>, <0, (4, 6, 9)>, <0, (5, 6, 9)>
- <1, (3, 6, 7)>, <1, (3, 6, 8)>, <1, (3, 7, 8)>, <1, (6, 7, 8)>
- <7, (1, 2, 3)>, <7, (1, 3, 4)>, <7, (1, 3, 9)>, <7, (2, 3, 4)>, <7, (3, 4, 9)>
- <9, (0, 3, 6)>, <9, (0, 3, 7)>, <9, (0, 6, 7)>, <9, (3, 6, 7)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].
