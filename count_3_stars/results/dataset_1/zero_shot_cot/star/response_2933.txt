Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, we need to identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 

Let's list down the possible 3-stars:

<0, (2, 6, 7)>
<1, (4, 7, 8)>
<2, (0, 6, 8)>
<3, (8, 9, 0)>
<4, (1, 7, 9)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we have found 5 unique 3-stars.

Therefore, the answer is [5].
