Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the occurrences of 3-stars. Let's list them step-by-step.

1. Node 0 does not form a 3-star as it has 2 edges instead of 3.
2. Node 1 does not form a 3-star as it has 2 edges instead of 3.
3. Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 4, and 7: <2, (0, 4, 7)>.
4. Node 3 does not form a 3-star as it has 2 edges instead of 3.
5. Node 4 does not form a 3-star as it has 2 edges instead of 3.
6. Node 5 does not form a 3-star as it has 2 edges instead of 3.
7. Node 6 does not form a 3-star as it has 3 edges but they connect to nodes 3, 5, and 7, which do not form a 3-star with it.
8. Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 5, and 9: <7, (2, 5, 9)>.
9. Node 8 does not form a 3-star as it has 3 edges but they connect to nodes 0, 1, and 4, which do not form a 3-star with it.
10. Node 9 does not form a 3-star as it has 2 edges instead of 3.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2]. The unique 3-stars found are: <2, (0, 4, 7)> and <7, (2, 5, 9)>.
