Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.
Since a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can start by checking each node in the graph to see if it forms a 3-star. 

Given the edges, the 3-stars in the graph are as follows:
<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<2, (0, 6, 7)>
<3, (0, 5, 9)>
<4, (0, 7, 9)>
<5, (0, 1, 3)>
<9, (1, 2, 3)>

Now we count the total number of 3-stars in the graph: [6].
