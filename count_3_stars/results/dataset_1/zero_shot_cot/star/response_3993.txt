Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 2) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all possible 3-stars based on the definition provided. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's find all such unique 3-stars:

1. Central node 2: (2, 1), (2, 4), (2, 5)
    <2, (1, 4, 5)>

2. Central node 6: (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 8)
    <6, (1, 3, 8)>

3. Central node 7: (7, 0), (7, 2), (7, 8)
    <7, (0, 2, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
