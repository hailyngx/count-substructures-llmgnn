Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, first, we need to identify the nodes in the graph and then find the 3-star configurations.

Given the graph with 10 nodes and 26 edges, we can represent the nodes and their connections as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to Node 8.
- Node 1 is connected to Nodes 3, 4, 8, and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to Nodes 3 and 5.
- Node 3 is connected to Nodes 1, 2, and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to Nodes 1, 5, 6, and 8.
- Node 5 is connected to Nodes 2, 4, and 7.
- Node 6 is connected to Node 4.
- Node 7 is connected to Node 5.
- Node 8 is connected to Nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to Nodes 1 and 8.

Now, let's find all the 3-stars in this graph:

1. From the edge (1, 3):
    <1, (3, 8, 9)>

2. From the edge (1, 4):
    <1, (3, 8, 9)>
    <4, (1, 5, 6)>

3. From the edge (1, 8):
    <1, (3, 4, 9)>
    <8, (0, 3, 4)>
    <8, (0, 1, 9)>
    <8, (3, 4, 9)>

4. From the edge (1, 9):
    <1, (3, 4, 8)>
    <9, (1, 8, 3)>

5. From the edge (2, 3):
    <3, (1, 8, 9)>
    <3, (1, 2, 8)>

6. From the edge (4, 5):
    <4, (1, 8, 9)>
    <5, (2, 4, 7)>

7. From the edge (5, 7):
    <5, (2, 4, 7)>

There are no more unique 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].  
The unique 3-stars are: <<1, (3, 8, 9)>, <4, (1, 5, 6)>, <8, (0, 3, 4)>, <8, (0, 1, 9)>, <8, (3, 4, 9)>, <9, (1, 8, 3)>, <3, (1, 2, 8)>, <5, (2, 4, 7)>>.
