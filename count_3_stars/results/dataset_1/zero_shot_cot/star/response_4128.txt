Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the 3-stars present. 

Let's list the 3-stars present in the graph:
<1, (2, 4, 5)>
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<6, (1, 3, 5)>
<8, (1, 3, 6)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we have a total of [4] 3-stars in the graph.
