Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, let's first identify the nodes connected to each node.

Node 0: 6
Node 1: 2, 7
Node 2: 1, 4
Node 4: 2, 9
Node 5: 6, 8
Node 6: 0, 5
Node 7: 1, 8
Node 8: 5, 7
Node 9: 4

Next, let's determine the 3-stars in this graph:

<0, (6, 5, 1)>
<1, (2, 7, 0)>
<2, (1, 4, 7)>
<4, (2, 9, 5)>
<5, (6, 8, 0)>
<6, (0, 5, 8)>
<7, (1, 8, 2)>
<8, (5, 7, 6)>
<9, (4, 2, 0)>

Therefore, there are [9] 3-stars in this graph.
