Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes. 

Let's list the 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (4, 5, 7)>
<1, (2, 5, 9)>
<2, (1, 5, 9)>
<3, (6, 7, -)>
<4, (0, 6, 9)>
<5, (0, 1, 2)>
<6, (1, 3, 4)>
<7, (0, 1, 3)>
<8, (0, 1, 7)>
<9, (1, 4, 5)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
