Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will be the potential centers of the 3-stars.  
Nodes connected to exactly three other nodes: 1, 3, 4, 7, 9

Next, for each of these potential center nodes, let's find the 3-stars they belong to. 
For node 1: (1, 0, 8), (1, 2, 7), (1, 3, 4), (1, 9, 7)  
For node 3: (3, 1, 4), (3, 2, 7), (3, 6, 7), (3, 4, 9)  
For node 4: (4, 1, 3), (4, 3, 9)  
For node 7: (7, 1, 2), (7, 3, 6), (7, 9, 1)  
For node 9: (9, 1, 7), (9, 3, 4), (9, 4, 7)

Counting the unique 3-stars, we have:  
<1, 0, 8>, <1, 2, 7>, <1, 3, 4>, <1, 9, 7>,  
<3, 1, 4>, <3, 2, 7>, <3, 6, 7>, <3, 4, 9>,  
<4, 1, 3>, <4, 3, 9>,  
<7, 1, 2>, <7, 3, 6>, <7, 9, 1>,  
<9, 1, 7>, <9, 3, 4>, <9, 4, 7>  

By counting the number of unique 3-stars, we get the final answer:
