Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all combinations of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

By examining the given edges, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph. 

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<2, (7, 9, 3)>
<4, (0, 3, 5)>
<6, (5, 8, 9)>
<8, (4, 6, 9)>
<9, (2, 3, 4)>

Count of 3-stars in the graph: [6]
