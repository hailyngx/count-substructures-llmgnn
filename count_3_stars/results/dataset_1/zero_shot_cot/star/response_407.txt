Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph can be calculated by identifying all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a star pattern.

Let's list down the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (4, 6, 7)>
<2, (7, 1, 3)>
<3, (1, 5, 7)>
<6, (0, 9, 7)>
<7, (0, 1, 2)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars leads to a total of [5].
