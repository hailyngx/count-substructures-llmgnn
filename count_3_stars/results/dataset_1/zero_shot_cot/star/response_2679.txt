Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. For node 0:
   - <0, (2, 4, 5)>
   - <0, (4, 5, 6)>
   - <0, (5, 6, 7)>
   - <0, (6, 7, 9)>

2. For node 1:
   - <1, (5, 6, 8)>

3. For node 2:
   - <2, (0, 4, 6)>
   - <2, (4, 6, 8)>

4. For node 3:
   - <3, (7, 0, 9)>

5. For node 5:
   - <5, (0, 8, 9)>
   - <5, (1, 8, 9)>

6. For node 6:
   - <6, (0, 1, 2)>

7. For node 8:
   - <8, (2, 5, 9)>
   
Counting the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we have found 13 unique 3-stars.

Therefore, the final answer is [13].
