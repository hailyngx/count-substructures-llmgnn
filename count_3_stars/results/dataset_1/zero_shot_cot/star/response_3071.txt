Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 10 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 4) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the graph. The central nodes are those nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them. In this case, node 0, node 4, and node 7 are the central nodes.

Now, let's find the 3-stars in the graph:
- For node 0: <0, (4, 6, 7)>
- For node 4: <4, (0, 7, 9)>
- For node 7: <7, (0, 4, -)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
