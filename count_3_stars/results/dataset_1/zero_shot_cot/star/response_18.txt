Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The center nodes can be any node in the graph. We will go through each node and find the number of 3-stars centered at that node.

For each node, we will look at its neighbors and count how many 3-stars can be formed with that node as the center. The formula is the combination of choosing 2 neighbors out of all neighbors of the center node.

Here is the breakdown for each node:
- Node 0 can form 3-stars with 3 combinations: (2, 3, 5), (3, 5, 6), (2, 5, 6)
- Node 1 can form 3-stars with 3 combinations: (3, 4, 5), (4, 5, 8), (3, 5, 8)
- Node 2 can form 3-stars with 1 combination: (0, 5, 3)
- Node 3 can form 3-stars with 2 combinations: (0, 1, 5), (0, 5, 6)
- Node 4 can form 3-stars with 1 combination: (1, 6, 7)
- Node 5 can form 3-stars with 3 combinations: (0, 1, 3), (0, 2, 3), (1, 3, 8)
- Node 6 can form 3-stars with 1 combination: (0, 4, 9)
- Node 7 can form 3-stars with 1 combination: (4, 5, 9)
- Node 8 can form 3-stars with 1 combination: (1, 3, 5)
- Node 9 can form 3-stars with 2 combinations: (4, 5, 6), (4, 6, 9)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [18].

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (2, 3, 5)>
<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<1, (3, 4, 5)>
<1, (4, 5, 8)>
<1, (3, 5, 8)>
<2, (0, 5, 3)>
<3, (0, 1, 5)>
<3, (0, 5, 6)>
<4, (1, 6, 7)>
<5, (0, 1, 3)>
<5, (0, 2, 3)>
<5, (1, 3, 8)>
<6, (0, 4, 9)>
<7, (4, 5, 9)>
<8, (1, 3, 5)>
<9, (4, 5, 6)>
<9, (4, 6, 9)>
