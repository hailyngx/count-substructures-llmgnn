Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are exactly connected to three other nodes. 

Let's go step-by-step:

1. Identify nodes with degree 3:
   - Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 5.
   - Node 1, 7, and 8 has degree more than 3, so they are not central nodes in 3-stars.
   - Node 3 is connected to nodes 7 and 9.
   - Node 6 does not have degree 3.
   - Node 9 does not have degree 3.

2. Count the number of 3-stars:
   - There are 2 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the answer is: [2]

List of unique 3-stars:
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
