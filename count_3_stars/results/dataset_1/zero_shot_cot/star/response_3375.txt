Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find all the nodes that are connected to exactly 3 other nodes, as these nodes can be potential centers of a 3-star. 
From the given edges:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 8, and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 6 and 7.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 4 and 8.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 9.

Now, let's check if any of these nodes can form a 3-star. We are looking for nodes where exactly three of its neighbors are connected to each other. 

From the analysis above, we see that only node 0 qualifies as a potential center for a 3-star. Let's find all 3-stars with node 0 as the center:

We find the following <3-star's> with node 0 as the center:
<0, (2, 5, 8)>
<0, (2, 5, 9)>

Since we cannot have duplication of the same 3-star, we can see that the total number of 3-stars is found to be [2].
