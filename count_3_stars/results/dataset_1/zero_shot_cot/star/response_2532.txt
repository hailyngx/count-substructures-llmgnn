Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are directly connected to each node:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 6, 8, and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0 and 2.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, and 6.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 5 and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 7, 8, and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 3 and 6.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 5.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 8, and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, and 7.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 7.

Next, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star: <0, (1, 2, 6)>.
- Node 2 forms 2 3-stars: <2, (0, 1, 6)> and <2, (4, 6, 8)>.
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star: <4, (2, 7, 8)>.
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star: <6, (0, 2, 5)>.
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star: <8, (3, 4, 7)>.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
