Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star configurations in the given graph:
1. Node 1: (5, 6, 3)
2. Node 5: (1, 3, 6)
3. Node 6: (1, 4, 5)
4. Node 7: (2, 4, 9)
5. Node 9: (3, 7, 8)
6. Node 4: (6, 7, 8)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
The unique 3-stars found are: <<1, (5, 6, 3)>, <5, (1, 3, 6)>, <6, (1, 4, 5)>, <7, (2, 4, 9)>, <9, (3, 7, 8)>, <4, (6, 7, 8)>>.
