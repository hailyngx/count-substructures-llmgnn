Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (2, 3, 7)>
2. <0, (2, 3, 8)>
3. <0, (2, 7, 8)>
4. <0, (3, 7, 8)>
5. <2, (0, 3, 5)>
6. <2, (3, 4, 5)>
7. <3, (0, 1, 5)>
8. <3, (1, 2, 5)>
9. <5, (1, 2, 3)>
10. <7, (0, 1, 8)>
11. <8, (0, 7, 9)>

Therefore, there are 11 3-stars in the given graph. 
So, the final answer is [11].
