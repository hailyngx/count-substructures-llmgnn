Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify the 3-stars present in the graph:

<0, (6, 7, 8)>
<4, (7, 8, 9)>
<7, (0, 4, 5)>
<8, (0, 1, 2)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars: [4].
