Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, we need to identify all the 3-stars in the given graph. 

Let's go through each node and check if it forms a 3-star:

1. Node 0: Forms 3-star with (0, 1, 3), (0, 1, 4)
2. Node 1: Forms 3-star with (1, 0, 3)
3. Node 2: Forms 3-star with (2, 3, 4), (2, 4, 5), (2, 5, 9)
4. Node 3: Forms 3-star with (3, 0, 1), (3, 0, 2)
5. Node 4: Forms 3-star with (4, 0, 2)
6. Node 5: Forms 3-star with (5, 2, 9), (5, 6, 8)
7. Node 6: Forms 3-star with (6, 5, 8)
8. Node 7: No 3-star can be formed.
9. Node 8: No 3-star can be formed.
10. Node 9: No 3-star can be formed.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found are: <0, (1, 3, 4)>, <1, (0, 3, 2)>, <2, (3, 4, 5)>, <2, (4, 5, 9)>, <5, (6, 8, 2)>.

Count of 3-stars = 5

So, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
