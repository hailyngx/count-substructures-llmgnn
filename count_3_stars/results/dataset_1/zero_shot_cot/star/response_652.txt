Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify which nodes can be the center of a 3-star. In a 3-star, the center node must have exactly 3 edges connected to it. From the given edges, nodes 2, 3, 5, and 7 have exactly 3 edges connected to them.

Next, we will look for 3-stars using each of these nodes as the center.

1. When node 2 is the center:
   - <2, (1, 5, 8)>
   - <2, (3, 6, 7)>

2. When node 3 is the center:
   - <3, (0, 2, 7)>

3. When node 5 is the center:
   - <5, (1, 2, 6)>
   - <5, (6, 8, 9)>

4. When node 7 is the center:
   - <7, (2, 3, 8)>
   - <7, (6, 8, 9)>

Therefore, there are a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
