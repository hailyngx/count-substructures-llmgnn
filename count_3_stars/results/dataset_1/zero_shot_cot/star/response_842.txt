Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes and their corresponding leaves. We will then count the number of 3-stars in the graph. 

The central nodes and their corresponding leaves are:
- Node 0: Leaves 3, 8
- Node 1: Leaves 2, 6, 9
- Node 2: Leaves 1, 3, 4, 6
- Node 3: Leaves 0, 2, 4, 7, 8
- Node 4: Leaves 2, 3, 5, 6
- Node 5: Leaves 4, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 6: Leaves 1, 2, 4, 5, 8
- Node 7: Leaves 3, 5
- Node 8: Leaves 0, 3, 5, 6
- Node 9: Leaves 1, 5

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars: 
- Node 0: <0, (3, 8)>
- Node 1: <1, (2, 6, 9)>
- Node 2: <2, (1, 3, 4)> <2, (3, 6, 4)>
- Node 3: <3, (2, 4, 0)> <3, (2, 4, 6)> <3, (4, 7, 8)>
- Node 4: <4, (2, 3, 6)> <4, (3, 2, 6)>
- Node 5: <5, (4, 6, 7)> <5, (6, 7, 8)> <5, (6, 7, 9)> <5, (7, 8, 9)>
- Node 6: <6, (1, 2, 4)> <6, (1, 2, 5)> <6, (2, 4, 5)> <6, (2, 4, 8)> <6, (5, 7, 8)>
- Node 7: <7, (5, 6, 8)>
- Node 8: <8, (0, 3, 5)> <8, (3, 5, 6)>
- Node 9: <9, (1, 5, 4)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars, we get a total of [14] 3-stars in the graph.
