Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 1) (6, 3) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars present. 

In a 3-star, the center node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list all possible 3-stars in the graph:

1. Central Node 0: (0, 1, 3)
2. Central Node 1: (1, 0, 5), (1, 7, 8), (1, 8, 5)
3. Central Node 3: (3, 0, 6), (3, 8, 9), (3, 6, 8)
4. Central Node 5: (5, 1, 0)
5. Central Node 6: (6, 3, 0)
6. Central Node 7: (7, 1, 8)
7. Central Node 8: (8, 1, 7), (8, 1, 9)
8. Central Node 9: (9, 8, 3)

Counting all the unique 3-stars, we find that there are 11 unique 3-stars present. Therefore, the answer is [11].

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (1, 3, 0)>, <1, (0, 5, 1)>, <1, (7, 1, 8)>, <1, (8, 5, 1)>, 
<3, (0, 6, 3)>, <3, (8, 9, 3)>, <3, (6, 8, 3)>, <5, (1, 0, 5)>, 
<6, (3, 0, 6)>, <7, (1, 8, 7)>, <8, (1, 7, 8)>
