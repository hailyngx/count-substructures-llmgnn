Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the 3-stars. The center node will have exactly three neighbors. Let's list the nodes and their corresponding number of neighbors:

- Node 0: 2 neighbors
- Node 1: 1 neighbor
- Node 3: 4 neighbors
- Node 4: 3 neighbors
- Node 5: 1 neighbor
- Node 6: 5 neighbors
- Node 7: 1 neighbor
- Node 8: 1 neighbor

Now, let's look for the 3-stars:

1. Node 3 is the center of a 3-star: <3, (1, 4, 6)>
2. Node 4 is the center of a 3-star: <4, (0, 3, 5)>
3. Node 6 is the center of two 3-stars: <6, (0, 3, 7)> and <6, (7, 8, 6)>

So, the total number of unique 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
