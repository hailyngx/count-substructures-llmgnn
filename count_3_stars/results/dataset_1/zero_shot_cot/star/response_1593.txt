Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 7) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible 3-stars. 

Node 1 seems to be the center of the 3-stars as it has the most connections. Let's list all the 3-stars with Node 1 as the center: 
<1, (0, 4, 5)>
<1, (0, 5, 9)>
<1, (4, 5, 9)>

Now let's count the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph: 
[3]
