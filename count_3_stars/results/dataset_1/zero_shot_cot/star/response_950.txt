Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star structures in the given graph:

- Node 0 is the central node of the 3-star with leaves 1, 4, and 6. (<0, (1, 4, 6)>)
- Node 1 is the central node of the 3-star with leaves 0 and 9. (<1, (0, 9)>)
- Node 3 is the central node of the 3-star with leaves 6 and 9. (<3, (6, 9)>)
- Node 6 is the central node of the 3-star with leaves 0, 3, and 7. (<6, (0, 3, 7)>)
- Node 8 is the central node of the 3-star with leaves 0, 5, and 7. (<8, (0, 5, 7)>)

Therefore, there are 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph, which can be counted as [5].
