Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars in the given graph. 
Given that a 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can identify the center nodes and their connected nodes. 

Upon analyzing the given edges, we find the following 3-stars:
1. Center node 0 with leaves 3, 4, and 7
2. Center node 3 with leaves 2, 6, and 8
3. Center node 8 with leaves 2, 5, and 3
4. Center node 9 with leaves 3, 6, and 7

Therefore, we have found 4 unique 3-stars.
