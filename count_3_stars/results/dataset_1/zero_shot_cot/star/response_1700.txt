Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all occurrences where one node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's start by listing all the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (1, 3, 9)>
<1, (0, 4, 8)>
<3, (0, 2, 9)>
<4, (1, 2, 3)>
<8, (1, 5, -)>
<9, (1, 3, 4)>

Now, we count the total number of 3-stars found:
