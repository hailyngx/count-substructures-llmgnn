Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the graph. These are the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. From the given edges, we can see that nodes 0, 3, and 6 are the central nodes since they each have three edges connected to them.

Now, let's find the 3-stars in the graph:

1. For node 0:
    - Node 0 is connected to nodes 3 and 9, forming a 3-star with (0, 3, 9).
    <0, (3, 9)>

2. For node 3:
    - Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 5, and 6. However, we are only interested in 3-stars, so we need to find combinations of 3 nodes out of the 4 connected to node 3:
        - Using (0, 3, 4): Node 3 is the central node, and nodes 0 and 4 are the leaves.
        - Using (0, 3, 5): Node 3 is the central node, and nodes 0 and 5 are the leaves.
        - Using (0, 3, 6): Node 3 is the central node, and nodes 0 and 6 are the leaves.
    <3, (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6)>

3. For node 6:
    - Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 7, forming a 3-star with (6, 1, 7).
    <6, (1, 7)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
