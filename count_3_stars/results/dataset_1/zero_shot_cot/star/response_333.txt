Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes are potential central nodes of 3-star graphs. We will also identify the neighboring nodes of these potential central nodes to form 3-stars.

Nodes connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 1 has neighbors: 0, 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 3 has neighbors: 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 4 has neighbors: 1, 3, 9
- Node 6 has neighbors: 1, 3, 8, 9
- Node 8 has neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 5, 6
- Node 9 has neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

Checking the potential 3-star combinations:
1. Central node 1: (0, 4, 8), (0, 6, 8), (4, 6, 8)
2. Central node 3: (4, 6, 8)
3. Central node 4: (1, 3, 9)
4. Central node 6: (1, 3, 8), (1, 3, 9), (1, 8, 9), (3, 8, 9)
5. Central node 8: (0, 1, 6)
6. Central node 9: (1, 4, 6)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
<1, (0, 4, 8)>, <1, (0, 6, 8)>, <1, (4, 6, 8)>, <3, (4, 6, 8)>, <4, (1, 3, 9)>, <6, (1, 3, 8)>, <6, (1, 3, 9)>, <6, (1, 8, 9)>.
