Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the 3-stars present in the graph. A 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Looking at the list of edges, we can identify the following unique 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<1, (0, 2, 4)>
<2, (0, 1, 4)>
<4, (0, 1, 2)>
<5, (0, 1, 2)>
<7, (2, 5, 9)>
<8, (4, 6, 9)>

All other nodes do not form 3-stars.

Counting the total number of unique 3-stars found: [7]
