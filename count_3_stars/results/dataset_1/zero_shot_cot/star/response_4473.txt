Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the possible 3-stars. Since a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges, we can look for nodes with three neighbors and count them as 3-stars.

Looking at the given graph:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors: 3, 4, 7, 8, 9
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors: 5, 8
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 3, 4, 9
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 0, 2, 4
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 9
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 1, 7, 9
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors: 7, 9
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 0, 5, 6, 9
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors: 0, 1
- Node 9 has 6 neighbors: 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (3, 4, 7)>
<0, (3, 4, 8)>
<0, (3, 7, 9)>
<0, (4, 8, 9)>
