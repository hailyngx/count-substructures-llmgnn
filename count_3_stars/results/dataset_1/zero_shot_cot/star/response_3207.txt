Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will look for each node as the center of a 3-star and count the number of 3-stars around it. 

Let's start by listing the 3-stars:
<0, (4, 6, 1)>  
<1, (3, 8, 9)>  
<2, (4, 7, 8)>  
<3, (1, 8, 9)>  
<4, (0, 2, 7)>  
<5, (8, 9, -)>  
<6, (0, 1, 7)>  
<7, (2, 4, 6)>  
<8, (1, 2, 3)>  
<9, (1, 3, 5)>  

Therefore, there are [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
