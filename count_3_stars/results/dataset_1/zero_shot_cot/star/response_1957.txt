Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 5) (3, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, we need to find the degrees of each node in the graph:

- Node 0: degree 2
- Node 1: degree 2
- Node 2: degree 1
- Node 3: degree 1
- Node 4: degree 2
- Node 5: degree 1
- Node 6: degree 5
- Node 7: degree 3
- Node 9: degree 3

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- From node 0: (0, 6, 7)
- From node 1: (1, 3, 7)
- From node 4: (4, 6, 9)
- From node 6: (6, 0, 7), (6, 4, 9)
- From node 7: (7, 0, 1)

Counting all unique 3-stars found, we get:
- <0, (6, 7, x)>
- <1, (3, 7, x)>
- <4, (6, 9, x)>
- <6, (0, 7, x)>
- <7, (0, 1, x)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
