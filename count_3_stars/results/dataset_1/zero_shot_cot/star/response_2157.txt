Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in this graph step-by-step.

Step 1: Identify the nodes connected to each node:
- Node 0: 1
- Node 1: 0, 4, 5, 9
- Node 2: 3
- Node 3: 2, 6
- Node 4: 1, 5, 6
- Node 5: 1, 4, 9
- Node 6: 3, 4
- Node 9: 1, 5

Step 2: Count the 3-stars:
- There are no 3-star configurations in this graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [0].
