Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that form a 3-star pattern. We are looking for nodes that have exactly 3 edges connecting them to other nodes. 

From the given edges, the nodes that have exactly 3 edges are:
Node 0: Connected to nodes 1, 4, 6
Node 1: Connected to nodes 0, 5, 7
Node 2: Connected to nodes 4, 5, 6
Node 4: Connected to nodes 0, 2, 5
Node 5: Connected to nodes 1, 2, 3
Node 6: Connected to nodes 0, 2, 8
Node 7: Connected to nodes 0, 1, 2
Node 8: Connected to nodes 2, 4, 6
Node 9: Connected to nodes 2, 3, 4

Let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph: 

[9]

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:

<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<1, (0, 5, 7)>
<2, (4, 5, 6)>
<4, (0, 2, 5)>
<5, (1, 2, 3)>
<6, (0, 2, 8)>
<7, (0, 1, 2)>
<8, (2, 4, 6)>
<9, (2, 3, 4)>
