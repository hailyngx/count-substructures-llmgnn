Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first identify the nodes that are part of each 3-star. 

Starting with the central node as the center of the 3-star, we look for nodes that are connected to the center. The nodes connected to the center form the leaves of the 3-star. 

Given the edges provided, we can identify the 3-stars as follows:
1. <0, (2, 3, 6)>
2. <1, (3, 6, 9)>
3. <2, (0, 5, 7)>
4. <4, (2, 5, 9)>
5. <5, (2, 4, 8)>
6. <6, (1, 2, 5)>
7. <7, (2, 3, -)>
8. <9, (1, 4, 8)>

After identifying the unique 3-stars, we count the total number of such 3-stars. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
