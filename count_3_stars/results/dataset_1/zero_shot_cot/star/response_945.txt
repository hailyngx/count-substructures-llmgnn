Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 
A 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Next, let's identify the 3-stars and count how many there are in total.
