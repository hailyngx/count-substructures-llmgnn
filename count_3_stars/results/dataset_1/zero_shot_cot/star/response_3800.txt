Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Let's go step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 3 and 8.
2. Node 1 is connected to node 4.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 6, and 9.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 8, and 9.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 1 and 7.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 6, 7, and 9.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 2 and 5.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 5, and 8.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 7.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 5.

Based on the connections above, the 3-stars in the given graph are as follows:
<0, (3, 8, 7)>
<1, (4, 7, 5)>
<2, (3, 6, 9)>
<3, (0, 2, 8)>
<4, (1, 7, 5)>
<5, (6, 7, 9)>
<6, (2, 5, 7)>
<7, (3, 4, 8)>
<8, (0, 3, 7)>
<9, (2, 3, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
