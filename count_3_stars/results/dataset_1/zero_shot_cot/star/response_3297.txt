Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the provided edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<1, (0, 3, 9)>
<3, (1, 2, 4)>
<4, (0, 1, 3)>
<7, (0, 1, 3)>
<9, (0, 1, 0)>

Counting all these unique 3-stars, we have a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
