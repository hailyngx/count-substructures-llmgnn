Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's consider each possible central node and count the number of 3-stars around it.

Central Node 0:
- (0, 5, 6), (0, 6, 5), (0, 5, 8), (0, 8, 5) -> <0, (5, 6, 8)> (1 unique 3-star)

Central Node 1: No 3-stars

Central Node 2:
- (2, 4, 6), (2, 6, 4), (2, 4, 9), (2, 9, 4) -> <2, (4, 6, 9)> (1 unique 3-star)

Central Node 3: No 3-stars

Central Node 4:
- (4, 1, 3), (4, 3, 1) -> <4, (1, 3)> (1 unique 3-star)

Central Node 5: No 3-stars

Central Node 6:
- (6, 0, 2), (6, 2, 0), (6, 0, 7), (6, 7, 0), (6, 2, 9), (6, 9, 2) -> <6, (0, 2, 7, 9)> (1 unique 3-star)

Central Node 7: No 3-stars

Central Node 8: No 3-stars

Central Node 9: No 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].  
The unique 3-stars are <0, (5, 6, 8)>, <2, (4, 6, 9)>, <4, (1, 3)>, and <6, (0, 2, 7, 9)>.
