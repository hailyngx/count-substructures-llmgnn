Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's start by listing all possible 3-stars:

<1, (3, 4, 7)>
<3, (0, 1, 5)>
<3, (1, 5, 7)>
<3, (5, 6, 8)>
<3, (6, 4, 8)>
<7, (1, 5, 8)>
<8, (3, 7, 9)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph:
[7]
