Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can identify the nodes that are connected by exactly three edges stemming from a central node. 

Let's go through the nodes and see if they form any 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 1, 3, 4, 7
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 0, 5, 7, 9
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 3, 5, 6
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 0, 2, 6, 9
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 0, 7, 8, 9
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 8, 9
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 2, 3, 8
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 4, 9
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 4, 5, 6
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors: 1, 3, 4, 5, 7

Now, let's list the 3-stars found:
<0, (1, 4, 7)>
<1, (0, 5, 7)>
<4, (0, 7, 9)>
<5, (1, 8, 9)>
<7, (0, 1, 4)>
<9, (1, 4, 7)>

The total number of unique 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
