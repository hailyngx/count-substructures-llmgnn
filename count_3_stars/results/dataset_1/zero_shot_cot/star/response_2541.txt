Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's analyze the given graph step by step to count the number of 3-stars.

Step 1: Identify the nodes connected to each node.  
    - Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 9.
    - Node 1 is connected to nodes 4, 7, and 8.
    - Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 5, and 6.
    - Node 3 is connected to nodes 7 and 8.
    - Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 9.
    - Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, 8, and 9.
    - Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 7, and 8.
    - Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 6, and 8.
    - Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 5, 6, and 7.
    - Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 5.

Step 2: Count the number of 3-stars in the graph.  
    - For each node, check if it forms a 3-star with exactly three neighboring nodes.  

    <0, (2, 5, 9)>
    <1, (4, 7, 8)>
    <2, (0, 5, 6)>
    <4, (1, 5, 9)>
    <5, (0, 2, 4)>
    <8, (1, 5, 7)>
    <9, (0, 4, 5)>

Step 3: Count the total number of 3-stars found.  
    - Total 3-stars: 7

Therefore, the final answer is [7].
