Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes connected to each node in the graph:
- Node 0: 2, 4
- Node 1: 2, 4
- Node 2: 0, 1, 3, 4, 7
- Node 3: 2, 8, 9
- Node 4: 0, 1, 2, 7
- Node 5: 6, 8, 9
- Node 6: 5
- Node 7: 2, 4
- Node 8: 3, 5
- Node 9: 3, 5

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

- There are three 3-stars with the center at node 2: <2, (0, 1, 4)>, <2, (3, 7, 4)>, and <2, (7, 3, 1)>.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
