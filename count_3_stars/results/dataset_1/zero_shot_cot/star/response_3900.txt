Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all possible 3-stars. 

From the given edges, we can find the following 3-stars: 
1. <0, (5, 6, 7)>
2. <0, (5, 6, 9)>
3. <0, (5, 7, 9)>
4. <0, (6, 7, 9)>
5. <2, (4, 5, 7)>
6. <2, (4, 5, 9)>
7. <2, (4, 7, 9)>
8. <4, (2, 3, 8)>
9. <5, (0, 2, 6)>
10. <7, (0, 1, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
