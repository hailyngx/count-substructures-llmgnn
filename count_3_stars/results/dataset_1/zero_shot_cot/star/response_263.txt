Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars, we first need to identify the nodes that are connected to each node in the graph. Then we can check if there is a 3-star structure around any node. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<1, (4, 5, 9)>
<2, (7, 9, -)>
<3, (0, 4, 8)>
<4, (0, 1, 3)>
<5, (0, 1, 8)>
<6, (7, -, -)>
<7, (2, 6, -)>
<8, (0, 3, 5)>
<9, (1, 2, -)>

Count of 3-stars = [10]
