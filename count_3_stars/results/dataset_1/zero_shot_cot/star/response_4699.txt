Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.
    - Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, and 8.
    - Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, and 8.
    - Node 8 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 6, and 7.
    
Step 2: Count the number of 3-stars in the graph.

[There are 3 3-stars in the given graph.]

<4, (0, 1, 2)>
<4, (5, 6, 8)>
<6, (2, 3, 8)>
