Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 6) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars.

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (1, 9, 6)>
<1, (0, 2, 6)>
<2, (1, 6, 8)>
<6, (1, 2, 3)>
<9, (0, 6, -)>

The number of 3-stars in the given graph is 5. 

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
