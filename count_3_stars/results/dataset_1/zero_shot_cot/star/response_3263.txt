Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's go step by step:

1. Identify nodes with exactly three edges:
   - Node 3 has edges with nodes 5, 6, and 7.
   - Node 8 has edges with nodes 2, 7, and 9.
   - Node 9 has edges with nodes 3, 5, and 8.
   
2. For each of the above nodes, construct the 3-stars:
   - <3, (5, 6, 7)>
   - <8, (2, 7, 9)>
   - <9, (3, 5, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].  
The unique 3-stars found are:
   - <3, (5, 6, 7)>
   - <8, (2, 7, 9)>
   - <9, (3, 5, 8)>
