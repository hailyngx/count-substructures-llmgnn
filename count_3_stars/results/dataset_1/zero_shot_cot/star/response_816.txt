Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify the nodes with exactly 3 edges. These nodes can be potential centers of 3-stars.  
Here are the nodes with only 3 edges:
- Node 6 

Step 2: For each of the potential centers, check if they are actually part of a 3-star. To form a 3-star, the center node must be connected to exactly 3 other nodes.  

For Node 6:
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 7, and 8. So, Node 6 forms a 3-star.  

Step 3: Count the total number of 3-stars formed.  
Total number of 3-stars: 1

Final Answer: [1]

Unique 3-stars:
<6, (2, 7, 8)>
