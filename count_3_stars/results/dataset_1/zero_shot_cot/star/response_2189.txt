Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that are directly connected to each node:
- Node 0: 4, 5, 6
- Node 1: 4
- Node 2: 9
- Node 3: 4, 5, 6
- Node 4: 0, 1, 3, 7
- Node 5: 0, 3
- Node 6: 0, 3, 7
- Node 7: 4, 6, 8
- Node 8: 7
- Node 9: 2

To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to find all unique configurations where one node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Based on the given edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:
- <0, (4, 5, 6)>
- <3, (4, 5, 6)>
- <4, (0, 1, 3)>
- <6, (0, 3, 7)>
- <7, (4, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
