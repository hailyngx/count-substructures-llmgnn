Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to visualize all possible configurations where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list down the unique 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (5, 6, 9)>
<1, (3, 4, 6)>
<2, (3, 6, 9)>
<3, (1, 2, 8)>
<4, (1, 5, 8)>
<5, (0, 4, 8)>
<6, (0, 1, 2)>
<8, (1, 3, 4)>
<9, (0, 5, 8)>

Now count the number of unique 3-stars: [9]
