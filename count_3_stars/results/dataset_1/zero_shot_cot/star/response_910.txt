Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify the unique 3-stars in the given graph:
    - Node 0: (4, 5), (4, 1), (5, 0)
    - Node 1: (3, 4), (3, 6)
    - Node 2: (9)
    - Node 3: (1, 4, 6), (1, 6, 9), (4, 1, 6), (4, 1, 9), (6, 1, 9), (6, 3, 9), (9, 1, 3), (9, 3, 6)
    - Node 4: (0, 1), (0, 5), (1, 0), (1, 3), (5, 0)
    - Node 5: (0, 4)
    - Node 6: (3, 1, 9), (3, 6, 7), (3, 6, 9), (6, 3, 7), (6, 3, 9), (7, 6, 9), (9, 3, 6), (9, 6, 7)
    - Node 7: (6, 9)
    - Node 9: (2, 3, 6), (2, 6, 7), (3, 2, 6), (3, 6, 7), (6, 2, 7), (6, 3, 7), (7, 6, 9), (7, 9, 6)

Step 2: Count the total number of unique 3-stars:
    - There are 19 unique 3-stars in the given graph.
