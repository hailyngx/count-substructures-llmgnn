Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (4, 1) (4, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Central node: 1, Leaves: (0, 2, 4) <1, (0, 2, 4)>
2. Central node: 2, Leaves: (0, 7, 1) <2, (0, 7, 1)>
3. Central node: 9, Leaves: (1, 4, 7) <9, (1, 4, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
