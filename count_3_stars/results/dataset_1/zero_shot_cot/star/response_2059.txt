Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes (a 3-star pattern). 

Let's list down all the unique 3-star patterns in the graph:

<0, (8, 1, 3)>
<1, (3, 8, 0)>
<2, (3, 4, 5)>
<3, (1, 2, 6)>
<4, (2, 9, 5)>
<5, (2, 4, -)>
<6, (3, -, -)>
<8, (0, 1, 3)>
<9, (4, -, -)>

Since the question asks for the count of 3-stars in the graph, we need to count the number of unique 3-star patterns listed above. 

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
