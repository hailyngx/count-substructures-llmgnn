Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars present. 

Let's start by listing all the 3-stars with their center node and leaf nodes:

1. <0, (1, 2, 4)>
2. <0, (4, 7, 8)>
3. <1, (0, 2, 4)>
4. <1, (4, 0, 2)>
5. <2, (0, 1, 4)>
6. <4, (0, 1, 3)>
7. <4, (6, 7, 0)>
8. <4, (7, 6, 0)>
9. <6, (4, 7, 0)>
10. <7, (0, 4, 6)>
11. <7, (4, 6, 0)>
12. <8, (0, 7, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
