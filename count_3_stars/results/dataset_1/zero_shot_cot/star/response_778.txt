Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's find the number of 3-star in the given graph:

The central node can be any of the 10 nodes in the graph. For each central node, we need to check if it is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

1. For node 0:
    - (0, 3), (0, 9), (3, 0), (9, 0) -> Form a 3-star <0, (3, 9)>
    
2. For node 1:
    - (1, 5), (1, 8), (1, 9), (5, 1), (8, 1), (9, 1) -> No 3-star
    
3. For node 2:
    - (2, 5), (5, 2) -> No 3-star
    
4. For node 3:
    - (3, 0) -> No 3-star
    
5. For node 4:
    - (4, 6), (4, 9), (6, 4), (9, 4) -> Form a 3-star <4, (6, 9)>
    
6. For node 5:
    - (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 8), (5, 9), (1, 5), (2, 5), (8, 5), (9, 5) -> Form two 3-stars <5, (1, 8, 9)> and <5, (2, 8, 9)>
    
7. For node 6:
    - (4, 6), (6, 4) -> No 3-star
    
8. For node 7:
    - (7, 9), (9, 7) -> No 3-star
    
9. For node 8:
    - (1, 8), (8, 1), (5, 8), (8, 5) -> No 3-star
    
10. For node 9:
    - (0, 9), (1, 9), (4, 9), (5, 9), (7, 9), (9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 7) -> Form four 3-stars <9, (0, 4, 5)>, <9, (1, 5, 7)>, <9, (1, 4, 5)>, and <9, (0, 1, 4)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is 7.
