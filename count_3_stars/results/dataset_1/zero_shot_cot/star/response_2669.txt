Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (4, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
We will first find all the 3-stars present in the given graph.

From the given edges, we can see that the central nodes can be 2, 6, or 1 (since they are connected to exactly three other nodes). Let's list the 3-stars:

<2, (0, 1, 5)>
<2, (1, 5, 7)>
<2, (5, 6, 7)>

<6, (2, 3, 8)>
<6, (3, 8, 9)>
<6, (2, 8, 9)>

<1, (4, 8, 9)>
<1, (4, 5, 8)>
<1, (1, 4, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
