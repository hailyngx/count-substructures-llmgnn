Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify the nodes that have exactly 3 edges connected to them. These nodes will be the centers of the 3-stars.  

Nodes with 3 edges connected to them:   
- Node 0  
- Node 3  

Step 2: For each center node found in Step 1, identify the adjacent nodes connected to them. These adjacent nodes will be the leaves of the 3-stars. 

3-stars with center node 0:
- <0, (2, 4, 6)>
- <0, (2, 6, 7)>
- <0, (4, 6, 7)>
- <0, (6, 7, 9)>

3-stars with center node 3:
- <3, (2, 6, 9)>
- <3, (6, 7, 9)>

Step 3: Count the total number of unique 3-stars found from Step 2.


Total number of 3-stars: [6]

Unique 3-stars found: 
- <0, (2, 4, 6)>
- <0, (2, 6, 7)>
- <0, (4, 6, 7)>
- <0, (6, 7, 9)>
- <3, (2, 6, 9)>
- <3, (6, 7, 9)>
