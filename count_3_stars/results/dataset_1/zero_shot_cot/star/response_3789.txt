Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- Node 0: It is connected to nodes 2 and 5. 
  This forms a 3-star: <0, (2, 5)>
- Node 2: It is connected to nodes 0, 1, 5, and 6. 
  This forms two 3-stars: <2, (0, 1, 5)> and <2, (0, 5, 6)>
- Node 6: It is connected to nodes 2, 3, 7, and 9. 
  This forms a 3-star: <6, (2, 3, 7)>

The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (2, 5)>, <2, (0, 1, 5)>, <2, (0, 5, 6)>, and <6, (2, 3, 7)>.
