Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify all nodes connected directly to node 0.  
Nodes directly connected to node 0: 3, 6, 7, 8  

Step 2: For each node found in Step 1, identify all nodes connected to it (excluding node 0).  
For node 3: 0, 1, 2, 4  
For node 6: 1, 2, 5, 7, 0  
For node 7: 0, 1, 6, 8  
For node 8: 0, 1, 4, 7  

Step 3: Count the number of 3-stars centered at node 0.  
Counting the number of 3-stars:
- For node 3: (0, 1, 2), (0, 1, 4) [2 3-stars]
- For node 6: (0, 1, 2), (0, 1, 5), (0, 1, 7), (0, 2, 5) [4 3-stars]
- For node 7: (0, 1, 8) [1 3-star]
- For node 8: (0, 1, 7) [1 3-star]

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].

<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<0, (1, 7, 8)>
