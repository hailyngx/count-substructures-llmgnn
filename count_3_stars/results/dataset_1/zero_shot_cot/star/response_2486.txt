Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star structures. 

The possible 3-stars in this graph are:
<0, (4, 6, 1)>
<4, (0, 1, 2)>
<6, (0, 2, 9)>
<1, (4, 7, 0)>
<2, (4, 6, 0)>
<3, (4, 5, 0)>
<5, (4, 3, 7)>
<7, (1, 5, 9)>
<9, (6, 7, 8)>

There are a total of [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
