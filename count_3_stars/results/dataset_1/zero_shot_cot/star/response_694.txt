Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Based on the given information, we can count the number of 3-stars in the graph.

To find a 3-star, we look for a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's determine the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Central Node 0: No 3-star
2. Central Node 1: <1, (0, 3, 4)>
3. Central Node 2: No 3-star
4. Central Node 3: <3, (0, 1, 4)>
5. Central Node 4: <4, (1, 3, 5)>
6. Central Node 5: <5, (1, 4, 6)>, <5, (2, 4, 9)>
7. Central Node 6: <6, (2, 3, 9)>
8. Central Node 7: No 3-star
9. Central Node 8: No 3-star
10. Central Node 9: No 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: <<1, (0, 3, 4)>, <3, (0, 1, 4)>, <4, (1, 3, 5)>, <5, (1, 4, 6)>, <5, (2, 4, 9)>>.
