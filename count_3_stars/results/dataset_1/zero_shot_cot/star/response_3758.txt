Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star pattern.

First, let's list out all nodes which are connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 5, 6, 7
- Node 5: 0, 1, 4, 9
- Node 7: 0, 6, 9
- Node 8: 2, 3, 4

Now let's identify the unique 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (2, 3, 7)>
<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<0, (5, 1, 4)>
<0, (6, 7, 9)>
<3, (0, 8, 4)>
<5, (0, 1, 9)>
<7, (0, 6, 9)>

Count of 3-stars: [7]
