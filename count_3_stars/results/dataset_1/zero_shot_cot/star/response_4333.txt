Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
We can identify the 3-stars in the given graph by looking for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list the 3-stars we can find in the graph:

<0, (2, 4, 7)>
<1, (2, 4, 7)>
<4, (0, 1, 7)>
<7, (0, 1, 4)>
<8, (1, 3, 4)>
<9, (3, 7, 9)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we get a total of [6].
