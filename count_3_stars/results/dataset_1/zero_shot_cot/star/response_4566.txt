Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
Let's first identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0: (0, 1), (0, 6), (0, 8)  
<0, (1, 6, 8)>

2. Node 1: (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 5)  
<1, (0, 2, 5)>

3. Node 2: (2, 1), (2, 7)  
<2, (1, 7)>

4. Node 3: (3, 4), (3, 9)  
<3, (4, 9)>

5. Node 4: (4, 3), (4, 7)  
<4, (3, 7)>

6. Node 5: (5, 1), (5, 6), (5, 7)  
<5, (1, 6, 7)>

7. Node 6: (6, 0), (6, 5)  
<6, (0, 5)>

8. Node 7: (7, 2), (7, 4), (7, 5)  
<7, (2, 4, 5)>

9. Node 8: (8, 0)  
<8, (0)>

10. Node 9: (9, 3)  
<9, (3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
