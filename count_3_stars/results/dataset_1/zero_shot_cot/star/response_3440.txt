Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes and their neighbors in this graph:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 6, 7, and 8.
- Node 1 is connected to node 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 5 and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0 and 7.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2 and 8.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph.

[There are 4 different 3-stars in this graph]

<0, (3, 6, 7)>
<0, (3, 7, 8)>
<0, (6, 0, 7)>
<0, (7, 0, 8)>
