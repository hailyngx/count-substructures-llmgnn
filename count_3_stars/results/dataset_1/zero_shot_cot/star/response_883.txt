Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list out the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (7, 8, 3)>
<1, (2, 4, 7)>
<2, (1, 3, 9)>
<3, (2, 5, 7)>
<4, (1, 8, 1)>
<5, (3, 6, 3)>
<6, (5, 7, 8)>
<7, (0, 1, 6)>
<8, (0, 4, 6)>
<9, (2, 7, 8)>

Counting all the unique 3-stars, we find that there are 10 of them in the given graph. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
