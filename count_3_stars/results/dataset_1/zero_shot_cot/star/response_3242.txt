Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's analyze each node to see if it forms a 3-star:

- For Node 0: Not a 3-star
- For Node 1: Not a 3-star
- For Node 2: Not a 3-star
- For Node 3: Not a 3-star
- For Node 4: Forms a 3-star <4, (0, 7, 9)>
- For Node 5: Not a 3-star
- For Node 6: Not a 3-star
- For Node 7: Forms a 3-star <7, (3, 4, 9)>
- For Node 8: Not a 3-star
- For Node 9: Forms a 3-star <9, (0, 4, 5)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3]. 
The unique 3-stars found are <4, (0, 7, 9)> and <7, (3, 4, 9)> and <9, (0, 4, 5)>.
