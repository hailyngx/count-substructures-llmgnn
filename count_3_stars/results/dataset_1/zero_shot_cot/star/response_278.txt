Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's start by listing all the possible 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<0, (1, 7, 9)>
<1, (0, 8, 9)>
<2, (5, 8, 9)>
<3, (5, 7, 9)>
<4, (0, 8, 9)>
<5, (0, 2, 3)>
<7, (0, 3, 9)>
<8, (1, 2, 4)>
<9, (0, 7, 2)>

Now we can count the number of unique 3-stars:
