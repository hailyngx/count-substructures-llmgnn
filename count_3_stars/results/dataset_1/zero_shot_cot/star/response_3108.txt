Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's find the number of 3-stars in the given graph step by step:

1. Identify all nodes connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 0: 3 (6, 7, 8)
- Node 1: 3 (2, 3, 4)
- Node 3: 4 (0, 1, 4, 7)
- Node 4: 4 (1, 3, 5, 6)
- Node 5: 4 (4, 6, 8, 9)
- Node 6: 3 (0, 4, 5)
- Node 7: 3 (0, 3, 9)
- Node 8: 4 (0, 1, 3, 4)
- Node 9: 2 (5, 7)

2. Count the number of unique 3-stars:
- From the identified nodes above, we have the following unique 3-stars:
    - <0, (6, 7, 8)>
    - <1, (2, 3, 4)>
    - <3, (0, 1, 4)>
    - <4, (1, 3, 5)>
    - <5, (4, 6, 8)>
    - <6, (0, 4, 5)>
    - <7, (0, 3, 9)>
    - <8, (0, 1, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
