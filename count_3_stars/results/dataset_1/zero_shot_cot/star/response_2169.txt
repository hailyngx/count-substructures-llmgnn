Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 6) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes directly. 

Let's go step-by-step: 
1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 6, and 9.
2. Node 1 is connected to node 6.
3. Node 3 is connected to nodes 6 and 8.
4. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 5, and 8.
5. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 6.
6. Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, 5, 8, and 9.
7. Node 7 is connected to node 9.
8. Node 8 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 6, and 9.
9. Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 6, 7, and 8.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<4, (0, 5, 8)>
<5, (0, 4, 6)>
<6, (0, 1, 3)>
<6, (0, 5, 9)>
<8, (3, 4, 6)>
<8, (4, 6, 9)>
<9, (6, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
