Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 8) (4, 0) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each possible central node and check if it is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's analyze the graph step by step:

1. Node 0: Connected to {4, 6, 8}. This forms a 3-star <0, (4, 6, 8)>.
2. Node 1: Connected to {6, 8}. Not a 3-star as it is not connected to exactly three other nodes.
3. Node 4: Connected to {0}. Not a 3-star as it is not connected to at least three other nodes.
4. Node 5: Connected to {6}. Not a 3-star as it is not connected to at least three other nodes.
5. Node 6: Connected to {0, 1, 5, 9}. This forms two 3-stars: <6, (0, 1, 5)> and <6, (0, 1, 9)>.
6. Node 8: Connected to {0, 1, 9}. This forms a 3-star <8, (0, 1, 9)>.
7. Node 9: Connected to {6, 8}. Not a 3-star as it is not connected to exactly three other nodes.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

Unique 3-stars found:
<0, (4, 6, 8)>
<6, (0, 1, 5)>
<6, (0, 1, 9)>
<8, (0, 1, 9)>
