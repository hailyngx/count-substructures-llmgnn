Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 4) (6, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are a total of 6 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are listed with unique 3-stars shown only once:

[6]
<0, (5, 2, 4)>
<1, (4, 5, 2)>
<2, (5, 8, 9)>
<4, (1, 5, 6)>
<9, (6, 8, 2)>
