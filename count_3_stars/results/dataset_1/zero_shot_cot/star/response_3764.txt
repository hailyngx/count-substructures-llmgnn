Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the given graph:
1. Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 6, and 8: <0, (1, 6, 8)>
2. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 3, and 4: <1, (0, 3, 4)>
3. Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 6, and 7: <2, (1, 6, 7)>
4. Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 4, and 6: <3, (1, 4, 6)>
5. Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, and 7: <4, (1, 3, 7)>
6. Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 7, and 9: <5, (4, 7, 9)>
7. Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 2, and 3: <6, (0, 2, 3)>
8. Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 2, and 4: <7, (1, 2, 4)>
9. Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 2, and 1: <8, (0, 2, 1)>
10. Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 4, and 9: <9, (3, 4, 9)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph.
