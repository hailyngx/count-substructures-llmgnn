Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 0) (8, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node in the graph is connected to exactly three other nodes. 
Let's go step-by-step and find all unique 3-stars in the graph: 

1. Node 0:
    - (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8)
    <0, (2, 5, 6)>
    <0, (2, 6, 7)>
    <0, (2, 7, 8)>
    
2. Node 1:
    - (1, 3) (1, 4)
    <1, (3, 4, _)>
    
3. Node 2:
    - (2, 0) (2, 9)
    <2, (0, 9, _)>
    
4. Node 3:
    - (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9)
    <3, (1, 6, 9)>
    
5. Nodes 4, 5, 7, 8 do not form 3-stars as they are not connected to exactly three other nodes.

6. Node 6:
    - (6, 0) (6, 3)
    <6, (0, 3, _)>
    
7. Node 9:
    - (9, 2) (9, 3)
    <9, (2, 3, _)>
    
Thus, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7] and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 5, 6)>, <0, (2, 6, 7)>, <0, (2, 7, 8)>, <1, (3, 4, _)>, <2, (0, 9, _)>, <3, (1, 6, 9)>, <6, (0, 3, _)>, <9, (2, 3, _)>.
