Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, which are potential center nodes of 3-stars.

The nodes with degree 3 are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.

Next, we will check each potential center node to see if it forms a 3-star with its neighbors. 

We will list down the 3-stars we find:

<0, (2, 5, 6)>
<1, (3, 6, 8)>
<2, (0, 4, 5)>
<3, (1, 4, 5)>
<4, (2, 3, 8)>
<5, (0, 2, 3)>
<6, (0, 1, 3)>
<7, (4, 5, 6)>
<8, (1, 2, 4)>
<9, (0, 4, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
