Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are directly connected to each node:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 6 and 9
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 5, and 8
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 8, and 9
- Node 3 is connected to node 4
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1 and 3
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 7
- Node 6 is connected to node 0
- Node 7 is connected to node 5
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1 and 2
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0 and 2

Next, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
- <0, (6, 9)>
- <1, (2, 4, 5)>
- <1, (5, 2, 8)>
- <2, (1, 8, 9)>
- <4, (1, 3, 5)>
- <5, (1, 2, 7)>
- <8, (1, 2, 9)>
- <9, (0, 2, 8)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars, we find that there are [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
