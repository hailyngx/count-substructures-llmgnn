Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 2) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph step-by-step.

Step 1: Identify the central nodes (degree 3)
From the given edges, we can see that nodes 0, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 have a degree of 3. These nodes have the potential to be the center of a 3-star.

Step 2: Find the 3-stars
Let's list the possible 3-stars in this graph:
<0, (5, 7, 1)>
<2, (5, 8, 9)>
<7, (0, 6, 5)>
<5, (0, 1, 2)>
<6, (2, 7, 3)>
<8, (2, 5, 9)>

Step 3: Count the number of unique 3-stars
In this graph, we have 6 unique 3-stars.

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
