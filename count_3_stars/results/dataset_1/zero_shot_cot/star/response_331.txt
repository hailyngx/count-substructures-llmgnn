Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.  
A 3-star has a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.  

Looking at the edges provided, we can see the following 3-stars:
- <0, (2, 3, 8)>  
- <1, (4, 8, 0)>  
- <2, (0, 3, 3)>  
- <3, (0, 2, 4)>  
- <4, (1, 3, 5)>  
- <8, (0, 1, 4)>  

There are a total of 6 unique 3-stars.  

The final answer is [6].
