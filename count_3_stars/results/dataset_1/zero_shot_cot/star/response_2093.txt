Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 4) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 5) 

Response:
To find all the 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step-by-step:

1. List nodes with their degree:
- Node 0: degree 3
- Node 1: degree 2
- Node 2: degree 1
- Node 3: degree 4
- Node 4: degree 3
- Node 5: degree 3
- Node 6: degree 1
- Node 7: degree 3
- Node 8: degree 1
    
2. Identify 3-stars based on the degrees of the nodes:
- <0, (3, 5, 7)>
- <3, (0, 5, 7)>
- <4, (1, 6, 7)>
- <5, (0, 3, 8)>
- <7, (0, 3, 4)>

[The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 5.]
