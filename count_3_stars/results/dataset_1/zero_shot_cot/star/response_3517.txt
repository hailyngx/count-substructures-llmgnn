Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes can act as the central nodes of 3-stars. Based on the given edges, these nodes are nodes 1, 3, and 9.

Step 2: For each of the identified central nodes, find the nodes that are connected to it by exactly one edge. These nodes will be the leaves of the 3-stars.

Step 3: Count the number of unique 3-stars that can be formed.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

For node 1:
- Leaves for node 1: 2, 5, 8, 9
<1, (2, 5, 8)> --> This is a duplicate with another 3-star.

For node 3:
- Leaves for node 3: 5, 6, 8
<3, (5, 6, 8)> 

For node 9:
- Leaves for node 9: 1, 4, 7
<9, (1, 4, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
