Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's start by listing all possible 3-stars in the given graph:

<2, (7, 8, 9)>
<3, (5, 9, 4)>
<4, (5, 3, 9)>
<7, (2, 9, 8)>
<8, (2, 7, 9)>
<9, (8, 2, 7)>

From the list above, we can see that there are **6** unique 3-stars in the graph. Therefore, the final answer is **[6]**.
