Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the possible 3-star configurations. 

From the list of edges, we can see that the central node (center) of each 3-star will be a node that has exactly 3 other nodes connected to it. Let's identify all such configurations:

1. <1, (2, 3, 6)>
2. <6, (1, 5, 7)>
3. <8, (1, 2, 5)>
4. <3, (1, 9, \_)> - The third node connected to node 3 is not specified, so it can't form a complete 3-star.
5. <5, (6, 8, \_)> - The third node connected to node 5 is not specified, so it can't form a complete 3-star.

Therefore, there are 3 unique 3-stars in the given graph: <1, (2, 3, 6)>, <6, (1, 5, 7)>, and <8, (1, 2, 5)>.

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
