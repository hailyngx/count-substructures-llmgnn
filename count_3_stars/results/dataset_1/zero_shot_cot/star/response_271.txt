Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that form 3-stars in this graph. 

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 5 and 7.  
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 6.  
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 5.  
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 5.  
- Node 4 is connected to node 8.  
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 6, and 7.  
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1 and 5.  
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0 and 5.  
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 3 and 4.  

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph.

There are 2 possible 3-stars:  
1. <0, (5, 7), (2)>  
2. <3, (1, 2, 5), (8)>  

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].  
So, the unique 3-stars found are <0, (5, 7), (2)> and <3, (1, 2, 5), (8)>.
