Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find the unique occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
   - Node 0: 1, 2, 4
   - Node 1: 0, 4, 5
   - Node 4: 0, 1, 5
   - Node 9: 0, 1, 4

2. Count the number of unique 3-stars:
   - There are 4 unique 3-stars in the graph.

<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<1, (0, 4, 5)>
<4, (0, 1, 5)>
<9, (0, 1, 4)>
