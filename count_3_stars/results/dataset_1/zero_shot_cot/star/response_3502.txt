Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Let's start by listing the 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (2, 9, 1)>
<1, (2, 9, 7)>
<2, (0, 1, 4)>
<3, (6, 9, 0)>
<4, (2, 5, 8)>
<5, (4, 6, 7)>
<6, (3, 9, 5)>
<7, (1, 2, 5)>
<8, (1, 4, -)>
<9, (0, 1, 3)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph: [9].
