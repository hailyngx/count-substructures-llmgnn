Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes and their connected nodes to form 3-stars. 

The central nodes will be the ones with exactly three edges connected to them. Now, let's list them: 

Central nodes: 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8

Now, for each central node, let's list the nodes connected to them.

For central node 1: (1, 2, 3), (1, 5, 7)
For central node 2: (2, 1, 3), (2, 6, 1)
For central node 3: (3, 1, 2), (3, 7, 8)
For central node 5: (5, 1, 7), (5, 4, 8)
For central node 7: (7, 1, 5), (7, 3, 4), (7, 5, 8)
For central node 8: (8, 3, 5), (8, 7, 9)

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars.

There are 6 unique 3-stars: 
<1, (2, 3, 5)>, <1, (5, 7, 1)>, <2, (1, 3, 6)>, <3, (1, 2, 7)>, <5, (1, 7, 4)>, <7, (1, 5, 8)>

Therefore, there are a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
