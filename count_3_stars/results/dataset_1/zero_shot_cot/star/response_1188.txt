Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (8, 3) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, let's determine the nodes that are connected to each node in the graph:

Node 0 is connected to nodes 5 and 9.
Node 1 is connected to node 2.
Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 6.
Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 8.
Node 4 is connected to node 3.
Node 5 is connected to nodes 0 and 6.
Node 6 is connected to nodes 2 and 5.
Node 8 is connected to node 3.
Node 9 is connected to node 0.

Next, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:
- 3-star with node 0 as the center: <0, (5, 9, 6)>
- 3-star with node 2 as the center: <2, (1, 3, 6)>
- 3-star with node 3 as the center: <3, (2, 4, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
