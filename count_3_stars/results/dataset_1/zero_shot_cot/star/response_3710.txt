Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, forming the leaves of the star. 

After examining the edges, we can identify the following nodes that have connections to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 1: Connected to nodes 4, 5, 6, and 9
- Node 4: Connected to nodes 1, 6, 7, and 5
- Node 6: Connected to nodes 1, 4, 8, and 7
- Node 8: Connected to nodes 3, 6, 7, and 9

Based on the above information, we can list the unique 3-stars in the graph as follows:
<1, (4, 5, 9)>
<4, (1, 6, 7)>
<6, (1, 4, 8)>
<8, (3, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
