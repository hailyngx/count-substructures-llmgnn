Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. For node 0: No 3-stars as it has only 3 edges.

2. For node 1: No 3-stars as it has only 1 edge.

3. For node 2: No 3-stars as it has only 2 edges.

4. For node 3: No 3-stars as it has only 1 edge.

5. For node 4: 
   - 3-star: <4, (0, 1, 2)>

6. For node 5: No 3-stars as it has only 3 edges.

7. For node 6: 
   - 3-star: <6, (2, 3, 5)>

8. For node 7: No 3-stars as it has only 2 edges.

9. For node 8: No 3-stars as it has only 3 edges.

10. For node 9: No 3-stars as it has only 3 edges.

Total number of 3-stars: [2]

Unique 3-stars found: <4, (0, 1, 2)>, <6, (2, 3, 5)>
