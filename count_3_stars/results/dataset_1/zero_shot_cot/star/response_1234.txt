Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

Upon analyzing the edges, we can see that the central node in each 3-star should be a node with three edges connected to it. Let's list the nodes with three edges connected to them:
- Node 4 has edges with nodes 1, 2, 6, and 9.
- Node 6 has edges with nodes 0, 3, 4, and 8.
- Node 9 has edges with nodes 2, 3, 4, and 7.

Now, we will list the unique 3-stars:
<4, (1, 2, 6)>
<6, (0, 3, 8)>
<9, (2, 3, 7)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
