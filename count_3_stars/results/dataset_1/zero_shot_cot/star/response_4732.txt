Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars by looking for the nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them. These nodes will be the centers of the 3-stars.

Nodes with 3 edges connected to them:
- Node 2 (connected to nodes 0, 6, 7)
- Node 3 (connected to nodes 1, 9)
- Node 8 (connected to nodes 1, 4, 6, 9)
- Node 9 (connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, 5, 8)

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

The 3-stars in the graph are:
<2, (0, 6, 7)>
<3, (1, 9, 5)>
<8, (1, 4, 6)>
<8, (1, 4, 9)>
<8, (1, 6, 9)>
<8, (4, 6, 9)>
<9, (2, 3, 4)>
<9, (2, 4, 5)>
<9, (2, 5, 8)>
<9, (3, 4, 5)>
<9, (3, 4, 8)>
<9, (3, 5, 8)>
<9, (4, 5, 8)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [13].
