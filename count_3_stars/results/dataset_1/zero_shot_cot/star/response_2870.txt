Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (1, 5, 6)>
2. <1, (0, 2, 4)>
3. <2, (1, 3, 6)>
4. <3, (0, 2, 6)>
5. <4, (1, 9, -)>
6. <5, (0, 1, 9)>
7. <6, (0, 2, 3)>
8. <7, (0, 8, 9)>
9. <8, (2, 7, -)>
10. <9, (0, 1, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
