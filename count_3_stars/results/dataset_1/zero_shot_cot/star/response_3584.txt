Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all unique instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars step-by-step.

Step 1: Identify nodes with exactly 3 connections:
- Node 2 has connections with nodes 0, 1, 5, and 7.
- Node 6 has connections with nodes 4, 5, 7, and 8.

Step 2: For each node identified in step 1, check if it forms a 3-star:
For Node 2:
- <2, (0, 1, 5)> forms a 3-star.

For Node 6:
- <6, (4, 5, 7)> forms a 3-star.
- <6, (7, 5, 8)> forms a 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: <2, (0, 1, 5)>, <6, (4, 5, 7)>, <6, (7, 5, 8)>.
