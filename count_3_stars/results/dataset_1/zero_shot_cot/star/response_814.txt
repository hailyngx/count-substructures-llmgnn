Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Based on the provided edges, here are the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<1, (4, 7, 8)>
<2, (0, 3, 6)>
<3, (2, 4, - )> **(Incomplete star)**
<4, (0, 3, 6)>
<5, (0, 6, 7)>
<6, (0, 2, 4)>
<7, (1, 4, 5)>
<8, (4, 6, 7)>

Since there are 8 unique 3-stars found above, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
