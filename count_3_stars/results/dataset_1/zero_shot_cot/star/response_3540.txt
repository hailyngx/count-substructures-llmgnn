Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Based on the given edge list, let's identify all the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<2, (0, 4, 9)>
<4, (0, 2, 3)>
<3, (4, 7, 9)>
<7, (1, 3, 5)>
<1, (7, 8, None)>
<8, (1, 5, None)>
<5, (4, 7, 8)>
<9, (2, 3, None)>
<6, (4, 7, 8)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
