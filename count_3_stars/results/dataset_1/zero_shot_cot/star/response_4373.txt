Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify the potential central nodes in the graph.  
    - Node 0, Node 1, Node 2, Node 3, Node 4, Node 5, Node 6, Node 7, Node 8, Node 9
    
Step 2: For each potential central node, identify its neighboring nodes.
    - Node 0 neighbors: 1, 3, 4, 8
    - Node 1 neighbors: 0, 2, 8
    - Node 2 neighbors: 1, 3, 4, 8, 9
    - Node 3 neighbors: 0, 2, 7
    - Node 4 neighbors: 0, 2, 9
    - Node 5 neighbors: 6, 7
    - Node 6 neighbors: 5, 8, 9
    - Node 7 neighbors: 3, 5
    - Node 8 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 6, 9
    - Node 9 neighbors: 2, 4, 6, 8

Step 3: Identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph
   - <0, (1, 3, 4)>
   - <2, (1, 3, 4)>
   - <8, (1, 2, 6)>
   - <8, (0, 1, 2)>
   - <8, (2, 4, 6)>
   - <8, (2, 6, 9)>
   - <9, (2, 4, 6)>
   - <9, (2, 6, 8)>
