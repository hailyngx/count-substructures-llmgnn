Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all possible 3-stars. 

Let's start by finding all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 8, and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 5.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 5, 6, and 7.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 6, and 8.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 5.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 6.

Now let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- There is 1 3-star with center node 0: <0, (1, 3, 9)>
- There are 3 3-stars with center node 1: <1, (0, 2, 9)>, <1, (2, 3, 8)>, <1, (8, 5, 9)>
- There is 1 3-star with center node 2: <2, (1, 3, 5)>
- There are 4 3-stars with center node 3: <3, (0, 2, 5)>, <3, (0, 5, 6)>, <3, (2, 5, 6)>, <3, (5, 6, 7)>
- There are 2 3-stars with center node 5: <5, (2, 3, 6)>, <5, (3, 6, 8)>
- There is 1 3-star with center node 6: <6, (3, 5, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [12]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (1, 3, 9)>, <1, (0, 2, 9)>, <1, (2, 3, 8)>, <1, (8, 5, 9)>, <2, (1, 3, 5)>, <3, (0, 2, 5)>, <3, (0, 5, 6)>, <3, (2, 5, 6)>, <3, (5, 6, 7)>, <5, (2, 3, 6)>, <5, (3, 6, 8)>, <6, (3, 5, 9)>.
