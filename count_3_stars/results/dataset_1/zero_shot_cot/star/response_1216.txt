Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the graph. The nodes with exactly 4 edges are potential central nodes since a 3-star has 4 total edges (1 to the center, 3 to the leaves). From the given edges, nodes 1 and 3 have 4 edges each, making them potential central nodes. 

Next, let's examine the neighbors of these potential central nodes to see if they form 3-star structures:

1. For node 1: Its neighbors are 0, 4, 5, 6, and 9.
    - <1, (0, 5, 6)> (a 3-star with node 1 as center and nodes 0, 5, 6 as leaves)
    - <1, (4, 5, 6)> (a 3-star with node 1 as center and nodes 4, 5, 6 as leaves)
    - <1, (5, 3, 9)> (a 3-star with node 1 as center and nodes 3, 5, 9 as leaves)
    - <1, (6, 4, 9)> (a 3-star with node 1 as center and nodes 4, 6, 9 as leaves)
    - <1, (9, 3, 5)> (a 3-star with node 1 as center and nodes 3, 5, 9 as leaves) 

2. For node 3: Its neighbors are 2, 5, 7, and 9.
    - <3, (2, 7, 5)> (a 3-star with node 3 as center and nodes 2, 5, 7 as leaves)
    - <3, (5, 1, 9)> (a 3-star with node 3 as center and nodes 1, 5, 9 as leaves)
    - <3, (7, 2, 9)> (a 3-star with node 3 as center and nodes 2, 7, 9 as leaves)
    - <3, (9, 4, 5)> (a 3-star with node 3 as center and nodes 4, 5, 9 as leaves)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: <1, (0, 5, 6)>, <1, (4, 5, 6)>, <1, (5, 3, 9)>, <1, (6, 4, 9)>, <1, (9, 3, 5)>, <3, (2, 7, 5)>, <3,(5, 1, 9)>, <3, (7, 2, 9)>, <3, (9, 4, 5)>.
