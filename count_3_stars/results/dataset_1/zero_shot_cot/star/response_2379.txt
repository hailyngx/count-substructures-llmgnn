Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to node 1, node 2, and node 4 to determine the 3-stars in the graph.

For node 1:
- Connected to nodes 3, 6, and 7.

For node 2:
- Connected to nodes 3, 4, and 7.

For node 4:
- Connected to nodes 2, 5, and 7.

Therefore, the 3-stars in the graph are:
<1, (3, 6, 7)>
<2, (3, 4, 7)>
<4, (2, 5, 7)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we get [3].
