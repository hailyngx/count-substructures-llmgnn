Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the graph. Since a 3-star graph has a center connected to exactly three other nodes, we need to find nodes with exactly 3 neighbors.

By examining the given edges, we identify nodes 1, 2, and 5 as central nodes since they each have 3 neighbors.

Next, we will construct the 3-stars around each central node:
1. Central node 1: <1, (2, 3, 8)>
2. Central node 2: <2, (1, 3, 5)>
3. Central node 5: <5, (2, 6, -)>

However, it's important to note that node 5 is not connected to a third node, so it cannot form a complete 3-star. Therefore, we can only count the 3-stars formed around nodes 1 and 2.

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
