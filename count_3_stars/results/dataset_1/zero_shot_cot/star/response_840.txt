Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's first identify the central nodes in the graph. Since a 3-star graph has a center node connected to exactly three other nodes, we need to look for nodes with a degree of 3.

From the given edges, we can see that nodes 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 9 have a degree of 3. 

Now, we need to find the 3-stars in the graph. 

Let's go through each central node and list the connected nodes to form the 3-stars:
1. Central node: 0
   Connected nodes: 2, 4, 8
   Potential 3-star: <0, (2, 4, 8)>

2. Central node: 2
   Connected nodes: 0, 4, 8
   Potential 3-star: <2, (0, 4, 8)>

3. Central node: 4
   Connected nodes: 0, 1, 2, 7
   Potential 3-stars: <4, (0, 1, 2)>, <4, (0, 2, 7)>

4. Central node: 6
   Connected nodes: 7, 8, 9
   Potential 3-star: <6, (7, 8, 9)>

5. Central node: 8
   Connected nodes: 0, 2, 6, 9
   Potential 3-star: <8, (0, 2, 6)>

6. Central node: 9
   Connected nodes: 1, 3, 6, 7, 8
   Potential 3-stars: <9, (1, 3, 6)>, <9, (6, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6]. The unique 3-stars are <0, (2, 4, 8)>, <2, (0, 4, 8)>, <4, (0, 1, 2)>, <4, (0, 2, 7)>, <6, (7, 8, 9)>, <8, (0, 2, 6)>, <9, (1, 3, 6)>, <9, (6, 7, 8)>.
