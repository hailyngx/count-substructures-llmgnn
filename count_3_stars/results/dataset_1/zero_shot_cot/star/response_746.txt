Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify each 3-star. 

Given the edges provided, let's find the 3-stars:

1. Node 0: (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6)
    Possible 3-star: <0, (3, 4, 5)> and <0, (3, 6, 5)>

2. Node 1: (1, 3)
    No 3-stars connected to this node.

3. Node 2: (2, 6), (2, 9)
    No 3-stars connected to this node.

4. Node 3: (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 5), (3, 7), (3, 9)
    Possible 3-star: <3, (0, 5, 9)>

5. Node 4: (4, 0), (4, 6)
    No 3-stars connected to this node.

6. Node 5: (5, 0), (5, 3)
    No 3-stars connected to this node.

7. Node 6: (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 8), (6, 9)
    Possible 3-star: <6, (0, 4, 9)>

8. Node 7: (7, 3)
    No 3-stars connected to this node.

9. Node 8: (8, 6)
    No 3-stars connected to this node.

10. Node 9: (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 6)
    Possible 3-star: <9, (2, 3, 6)>

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found are: <0, (3, 4, 5)>, <0, (3, 6, 5)>, <3, (0, 5, 9)>, <6, (0, 4, 9)>, and <9, (2, 3, 6)>.
