Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0: (0, 1, 4), (0, 1, 6), (0, 4, 6) 
2. Node 1: (1, 0, 5), (1, 5, 2) 
3. Node 2: (2, 3, 7) 
4. Node 4: (4, 0, 2), (4, 2, 8) 
5. Node 5: (5, 1, 2) 
6. Node 6: (6, 0, 5), (6, 2, 7) 
7. Node 7: (7, 2, 6), (7, 2, 8) 
8. Node 8: (8, 4, 7) 

Count of 3-stars: [11]
Unique 3-stars: <0, (1, 4, 6)>, <1, (0, 5, 2)>, <2, (3, 7, 6)>, <4, (0, 2, 8)>, <5, (1, 2)>, <6, (0, 5)>, <7, (2, 6, 8)>, <8, (4, 7)>
