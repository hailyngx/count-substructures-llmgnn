Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's first identify the central nodes of the 3-stars. A central node in a 3-star must have exactly 3 edges connected to it. Based on the given graph, nodes 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, and 8 meet this criteria. 

Now, let's find the 3-stars in the graph:
- 3-star with central node 0: (0, 4, 5), (0, 7, 8)
- 3-star with central node 1: (1, 2, 6)
- 3-star with central node 4: (4, 1, 3)
- 3-star with central node 5: (5, 6, 9)
- 3-star with central node 6: (6, 1, 5), (6, 7, 8)
- 3-star with central node 8: (8, 0, 9)

Therefore, there are a total of [7] 3-stars in the given graph. 

<0, (4, 5, 7)>, <0, (4, 5, 8)>, <1, (2, 6, -)>, <4, (1, 3, -)>, <5, (6, 9, -)>, <6, (1, 5, 7)>, <6, (1, 5, 8)>, <8, (0, 9, -)>
