Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's analyze the given graph step-by-step to identify the 3-stars.

Step 1: Identify the center nodes (nodes connected to exactly 3 other nodes).
Since the central node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a 3-star graph, we need to find nodes with degree 3.

From the given edges, nodes 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 9 have degree 3 (connected to exactly 3 other nodes).

Step 2: Identify the 3-stars centered at each central node.
We will consider each central node in turn and identify the 3-stars around them.

For node 1:
Possible 3-stars for node 1: (1, 2, 5), (1, 3, 6)
<1, (2, 5, 6)>

For node 2:
Possible 3-stars for node 2: (2, 1, 5), (2, 9, 3)
<2, (1, 5, 9)>

For node 3:
Possible 3-stars for node 3: (3, 1, 7), (3, 9, 6)
<3, (1, 7, 9)>

For node 5:
Possible 3-stars for node 5: (5, 1, 2), (5, 9, 6)
<5, (1, 2, 9)>

For node 6:
Possible 3-stars for node 6: (6, 1, 7), (6, 9, 3)
<6, (1, 7, 9)>

For node 7:
Possible 3-stars for node 7: (7, 3, 6), (7, 8, 1)
<7, (1, 3, 8)>

For node 9:
Possible 3-stars for node 9: (9, 2, 5), (9, 3, 6)
<9, (2, 5, 6)>

Step 3: Count the number of unique 3-stars.
Count of unique 3-stars: 7

Final Answer: [7]
