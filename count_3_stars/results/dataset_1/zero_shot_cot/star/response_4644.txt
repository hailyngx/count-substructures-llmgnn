Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's start by identifying the central nodes and their adjacent nodes to find the 3-stars in the given graph.
Based on the given edges, we can see the following:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 6.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 5, 8, and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1 and 5.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 5, and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 6, and 7.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 7.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 7.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1 and 5.

Now, let's count the unique 3-stars. The total number of 3-stars in this graph is [10]. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<1, (2, 4, 9)>
<3, (0, 5, 8)>
<4, (1, 6, 7)>
<5, (0, 2, 9)>
<6, (0, 4, 7)>
<7, (4, 6, 8)>
<8, (1, 3, 7)>
<9, (1, 5, 2)> [10]
