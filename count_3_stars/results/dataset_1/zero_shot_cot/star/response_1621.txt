Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the 3-stars. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's look at the graph and identify the 3-stars:

- 3-stars with central node 0: <0, (2, 6, 9)>
- 3-stars with central node 1: <1, (2, 5, 9)>
- 3-stars with central node 2: <2, (0, 1, 8)>
- 3-stars with central node 4: <4, (1, 6, 8)>
- 3-stars with central node 5: <5, (1, 7, 8)>
- 3-stars with central node 7: <7, (3, 5, 6)>
- 3-stars with central node 8: <8, (1, 2, 7)>
- 3-stars with central node 9: <9, (0, 1, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
