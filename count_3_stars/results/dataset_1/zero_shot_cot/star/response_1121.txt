Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<1, (3, 6, 7)>
<3, (1, 2, 5)>
<3, (1, 5, 6)>
<3, (2, 5, 7)>
<3, (5, 2, 7)>
<7, (1, 3, 8)>
<7, (1, 3, 9)>
<7, (8, 3, 9)>

Since there are 8 unique 3-stars in the graph, the total number of 3-stars is [8].
