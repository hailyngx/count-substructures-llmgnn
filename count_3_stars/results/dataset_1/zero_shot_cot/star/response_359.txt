Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify nodes connected to node 2
    - Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, and 9.

Step 2: For each node connected to node 2, check if there are two other nodes connected to it for forming a 3-star.
    - For node 0: Nodes 1 and 3 are not connected to node 0.
    - For node 1: Nodes 0 and 3 are not connected to node 1.
    - For node 3: Nodes 4 and 7 are connected to node 3, which forms a 3-star <3, (4, 7)>.
    - For node 9: No other nodes are connected to node 9.

Step 3: Count the total number of 3-stars found.
    - Total 3-stars: 1
