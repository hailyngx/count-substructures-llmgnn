Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in the form of a 3-star. 

Let's go step by step:

1. For each node in the graph, check if it is the center of a 3-star:
   
   - Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 5, 6, 7, 8. (0, 5, 6, 7) is a 3-star.
   - Node 1 has 2 neighbors: 5, 7. Thus, node 1 is not a center of a 3-star.
   - Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 3, 4, 6, 7. (2, 3, 4, 6) is a 3-star.
   - Node 3 has 2 neighbors: 2, 6. Thus, node 3 is not a center of a 3-star.
   - Node 4 has 1 neighbor: 2. Thus, node 4 is not a center of a 3-star.
   - Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 0, 1, 7. (5, 0, 1, 7) is a 3-star.
   - Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 9. (6, 0, 2, 3) is a 3-star.
   - Node 7 has 5 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 5, 8. (7, 0, 1, 5) and (7, 2, 5, 8) are 3-stars.
   - Node 8 has 2 neighbors: 0, 7. Thus, node 8 is not a center of a 3-star.
   - Node 9 has 2 neighbors: 6, 7. Thus, node 9 is not a center of a 3-star.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <0, (5, 6, 7)>, <2, (3, 4, 6)>, <5, (0, 1, 7)>, <6, (0, 2, 3)>, <7, (0, 1, 5)>, <7, (2, 5, 8)>.

Thus, there are a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
