Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for each node and check how many 3-stars it is a part of. 

Let's go step-by-step: 

1. Node 0:
    - 3-star with node 0 as the center: <0, (2, 6, 7)>
    Total 3-stars for node 0: 1

2. Node 1:
    - 3-star with node 1 as the center: <1, (4, 5, 8)>
    Total 3-stars for node 1: 1

3. Node 2:
    - 3-star with node 2 as the center: <2, (0, 6, 7)>
    Total 3-stars for node 2: 1

4. Node 3:
    - No 3-stars with node 3 as the center.
    Total 3-stars for node 3: 0

5. Node 4:
    - 3-star with node 4 as the center: <4, (1, 5, 6)>
    Total 3-stars for node 4: 1

6. Node 5:
    - 3-star with node 5 as the center: <5, (1, 3, 4)> 
                                   <5, (3, 6, 9)>
    Total 3-stars for node 5: 2

7. Node 6:
    - 3-star with node 6 as the center: <6, (0, 4, 5)>
    Total 3-stars for node 6: 1

8. Node 7:
    - 3-star with node 7 as the center: <7, (2, 4, 6)>
    Total 3-stars for node 7: 1

9. Node 8:
    - No 3-stars with node 8 as the center.
    Total 3-stars for node 8: 0

10. Node 9:
    - No 3-stars with node 9 as the center.
    Total 3-stars for node 9: 0

Therefore, there are a total of [7] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (2, 6, 7)>
<1, (4, 5, 8)>
<4, (1, 5, 6)>
<5, (1, 3, 4)>
<5, (3, 6, 9)>
<6, (0, 4, 5)>
<7, (2, 4, 6)>
