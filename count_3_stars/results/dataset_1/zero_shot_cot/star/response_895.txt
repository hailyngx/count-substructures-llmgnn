Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to each node:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 8
- Node 1: 4, 7
- Node 2: 0, 8
- Node 3: 0
- Node 4: 1, 6
- Node 5: 6
- Node 6: 4, 5
- Node 7: 1, 9
- Node 8: 0, 2
- Node 9: 7

Now, let's count the 3-stars in the graph:
- For node 0: <0, (2, 3, 8)>
- For node 1: <1, (4, 7)>
- For node 2: <2, (0, 8)>
- For node 4: <4, (1, 6)>
- For node 6: <6, (4, 5)>
- For node 7: <7, (1, 9)>
- For node 8: <8, (0, 2)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
