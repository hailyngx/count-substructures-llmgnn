Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them, forming a 3-star pattern.

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0: (0, 4, 5), (0, 6, 7), (0, 7, 9)
- Node 1: (1, 6, 9)
- Node 2: (2, 7)
- Node 4: (4, 0, 5), (4, 5, 7)
- Node 5: (5, 0, 4), (5, 4, 6), (5, 6, 7)
- Node 6: (6, 0, 1), (6, 1, 5), (6, 5, 7)
- Node 7: (7, 0, 2), (7, 2, 4), (7, 4, 5), (7, 5, 6), (7, 6, 8)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].

Unique 3-stars: 
<0, (4, 5, 7)>
<0, (6, 7, 9)>
<1, (6, 9)>
<2, (7)>
<4, (0, 5, 7)>
<5, (0, 4, 6)>
<6, (0, 1, 5)>
<7, (0, 2, 4)>
<7, (4, 5, 6)>
<7, (5, 6, 8)>
