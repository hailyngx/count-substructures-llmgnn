Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for every instance where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's identify the 3-stars present in the given graph.

Starting with each node as the potential center:
1. Node 0:
   - <0, (1, 2, 4)>
2. Node 1:
   - <1, (0, 6, 8)>
3. Node 2:
   - <2, (0, 5, 7)>
4. Node 3: No 3-star with node 3 as the center.
5. Node 4:
   - <4, (0, 7, 5)>
6. Node 5: No 3-star with node 5 as the center.
7. Node 6:
   - <6, (1, 8, 9)>
8. Node 7: No 3-star with node 7 as the center.
9. Node 8: No 3-star with node 8 as the center.
10. Node 9: No 3-star with node 9 as the center.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 2, 4)>, <1, (0, 6, 8)>, <2, (0, 5, 7)>, <4, (0, 7, 5)>, <6, (1, 8, 9)>

Counting the number of 3-stars in the graph: [5]
