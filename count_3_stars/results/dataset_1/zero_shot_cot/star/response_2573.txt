Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible combinations where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Now, let's list down the unique 3-stars found in the given graph:

<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<1, (0, 2, 4)>
<2, (1, 4, 5)>
<3, (0, 5, 7)>
<4, (1, 2, 5)>
<5, (0, 2, 3)>
<6, (5, 7)>
<7, (3, 5, 6)>
<8, (3, 5)>

By counting the unique 3-stars, we find that there are a total of [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
