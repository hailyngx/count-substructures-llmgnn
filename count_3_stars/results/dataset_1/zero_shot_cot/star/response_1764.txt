Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 6) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's analyze the given graph step by step:

1. We first identify the central node and its degree. 
   - From the given edge list, we see that node 6 has a degree of 4, which makes it the central node of a 3-star.

2. Next, we find the leaves connected to the central node.
   - The three nodes connected to node 6 are 2, 4, 8, and 9.

3. Now, we can count the number of unique 3-stars in the graph.
   - Based on our findings, there is only one unique 3-star in the graph: <6, (2, 4, 8)>.

Therefore, the final answer is [1].
