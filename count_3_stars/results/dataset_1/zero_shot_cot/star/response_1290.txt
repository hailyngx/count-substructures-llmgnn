Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to each node:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 6 and 7
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 5
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 5
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 7
- Node 4 is connected to node 6
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 6
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 5, and 9
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0 and 3
- Node 8 is connected to node 9
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 6 and 8

Next, let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:
- <0, (6, 7, 4)>
- <1, (2, 3, 5)>
- <3, (1, 2, 7)>
- <6, (0, 5, 9)>
- <9, (6, 8, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
