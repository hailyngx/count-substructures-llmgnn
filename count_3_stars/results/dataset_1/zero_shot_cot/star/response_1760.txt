Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To identify the 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's analyze the connections to determine the unique 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 0 has 2 adjacent nodes: 3 and 8.
2. Node 1 has 6 adjacent nodes: 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
3. Node 2 has 2 adjacent nodes: 4 and 8.
4. Node 3 has 3 adjacent nodes: 0, 4, 9.
5. Node 4 has 6 adjacent nodes: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8.
6. Node 5 has 4 adjacent nodes: 1, 4, 8, 9.
7. Node 6 has 3 adjacent nodes: 1, 7, 8.
8. Node 7 has 2 adjacent nodes: 1, 6.
9. Node 8 has 6 adjacent nodes: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 9.
10. Node 9 has 3 adjacent nodes: 3, 5, 8.

Based on the analysis above, we can see the following 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (3, 8)>
<1, (4, 5, 8)>
<3, (0, 4, 9)>
<4, (1, 2, 8)>
<5, (1, 4, 8)>
<6, (1, 7, 8)>
<8, (0, 1, 2)>
<9, (3, 5, 8)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
