Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (2, 5, 6)>
2. <2, (0, 8, 9)>
3. <3, (6, 7, 9)>

[The number of 3-stars in the graph is 3]
