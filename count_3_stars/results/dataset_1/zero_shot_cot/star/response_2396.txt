Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars present. 
Let's list the unique 3-stars present in the graph:

<2, (8, 9, 3)>
<3, (5, 9, 8)>
<3, (6, 4, 5)>
<3, (8, 2, 5)>
<4, (5, 6, 3)>
<4, (6, 5, 3)>
<5, (3, 4, 6)>
<5, (4, 6, 3)>
<6, (3, 4, 5)>
<6, (4, 5, 3)>
<7, (9, 6, 5)>
<8, (3, 5, 2)>
<9, (2, 5, 7)>

Counting these unique 3-stars, we find that there are a total of [13] 3-stars in the given graph.
