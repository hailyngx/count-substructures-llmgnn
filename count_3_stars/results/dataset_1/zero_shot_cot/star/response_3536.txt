Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are at the center of a 3-star. A 3-star consists of one central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

From the provided edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:

1. <0, (7, 9)>
2. <1, (7)>
3. <2, (4, 6)>
4. <3, (5, 7, 9)>
5. <4, (2, 9)>
6. <5, (3, 6, 7)>
7. <6, (2, 5, 8, 9)>
8. <7, (0, 1, 3, 5)>
9. <9, (0, 3, 4, 6)>

Therefore, there are a total of [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
