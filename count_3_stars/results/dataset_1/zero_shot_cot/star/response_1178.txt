Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star. 

First, let's identify all the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 0: Connected to 2, 3, and 9
- Node 1: Connected to 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7
- Node 5: Connected to 1, 4, 6, and 9
- Node 6: Connected to 1, 5, 7, and 8
- Node 7: Connected to 1, 2, 6, and 8
- Node 8: Connected to 3, 6, 7, and 9
- Node 9: Connected to 0, 5, 8

Next, let's list out the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (3, 9, 0)>
<1, (2, 4, 5)>
<5, (1, 4, 6)>
<6, (1, 7, 8)>
<7, (1, 2, 8)>
<8, (3, 6, 9)>

Counting these unique 3-stars, we find that there are [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
