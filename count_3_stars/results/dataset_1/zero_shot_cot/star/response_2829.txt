Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first identify the central node and the leaves connected to it. A 3-star consists of the center node and exactly three leaves connected to it.

Let's list the 3-stars:

<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<1, (0, 5, 8)>
<2, (0, 5, 7)>
<5, (0, 1, 8)>
<8, (0, 1, 5)>

Count of 3-stars: [5]
