Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can identify each node that serves as the center of a 3-star and verify if it is indeed connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Based on the given edges, we can identify the following unique 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<1, (0, 2, 9)>
<2, (1, 4, 8)>
<4, (0, 2, 5)>
<5, (0, 4, -)>
<8, (2, 4, 9)>
<9, (1, 3, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
