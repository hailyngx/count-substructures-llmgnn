Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes of the 3-stars. In a 3-star graph, the central node should have three neighbors. 
Central nodes: 1, 3, 4, 5, 9

Now, let's find the leaves connected to each central node: 
1: 0, 2, 3, 5, 9
3: 1, 2, 4, 5, 9
4: 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8
5: 1, 3, 4, 7, 9
9: 1, 3, 5, 6

Next, let's count the number of unique 3-stars:
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<1, (0, 2, 5)>
<1, (0, 3, 5)>
<1, (2, 3, 5)>
<3, (1, 2, 4)>
<3, (1, 2, 5)>
<3, (1, 4, 5)>
<3, (2, 4, 5)>
<4, (0, 2, 3)>
<4, (0, 2, 5)>
<4, (0, 3, 5)>
<4, (2, 3, 5)>
<5, (1, 3, 7)>
<5, (1, 4, 7)>
<5, (1, 5, 7)>
<5, (3, 4, 7)>
<5, (3, 5, 7)>
<9, (1, 3, 6)>
<9, (1, 5, 6)>
<9, (3, 5, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [20].
