Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star structures in this graph:

1. <1, (2, 4, 7)>
2. <2, (1, 8, 9)>
3. <3, (5, 7, 9)>
4. <4, (0, 1, 6)>
5. <5, (3, 7, 9)>
6. <6, (4)>
7. <7, (1, 3, 5, 8, 9)>
8. <8, (2, 7, 9)>
9. <9, (2, 5, 7, 8)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we get [9].
