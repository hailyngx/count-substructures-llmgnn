Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the central nodes. 

The central nodes are the nodes that have exactly 3 neighbors. Let's list the central nodes first:
- Node 0 has neighbors 1, 2, 6, 7
- Node 2 has neighbors 0, 7, 8
- Node 3 has neighbors 4, 8, 9
- Node 4 has neighbors 3, 6
- Node 6 has neighbors 0, 4, 7, 8, 9
- Node 7 has neighbors 0, 2, 6, 9
- Node 8 has neighbors 2, 3, 6
- Node 9 has neighbors 3, 5, 6, 7

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars for each central node:
- Node 0 forms 2 different 3-stars: <0, (1, 6, 7)> and <0, (2, 6, 7)>
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star: <2, (0, 7, 8)>
- Node 3 forms 0 3-stars
- Node 4 forms 0 3-stars
- Node 6 forms 2 different 3-stars: <6, (0, 4, 7)> and <6, (7, 8, 9)>
- Node 7 forms 1 3-star: <7, (0, 6, 9)>
- Node 8 forms 0 3-stars
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star: <9, (3, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (1, 6, 7)>, <0, (2, 6, 7)>, <2, (0, 7, 8)>, <6, (0, 4, 7)>, <6, (7, 8, 9)>, <7, (0, 6, 9)>, <9, (3, 6, 7)>.
