Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the graph. Since a 3-star graph has a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we need to find nodes that have exactly three edges incident to them. These nodes can be potential central nodes for 3-stars.

From the given edges, the nodes that have exactly three incident edges are:
- Node 0 (connected to nodes 1, 7, and 1)
- Node 6 (connected to nodes 1, 9, and 1)
- Node 8 (connected to nodes 5, 9, and 5)

Next, let's determine the 3-stars in the graph. We search for nodes that, with their incident edges, form a 3-star configuration.

There are three unique 3-stars in this graph:
<0, (1, 7, 1)>
<6, (1, 9, 1)>
<8, (5, 9, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
