Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with degree 3, as these are the potential central nodes of 3-star graphs.  
From the given edges, the nodes with degree 3 are 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8.  
Now, let's check each potential central node to see if it forms a 3-star graph.  

For central node 0:
 - <0, (1, 3, 4)>
 - <0, (1, 6, 7)>
 - <0, (3, 4, 6)>
  Count: 3

For central node 1:
 - <1, (0, 2, 3)>
 - <1, (0, 6, 7)>
 - <1, (2, 4, 6)>
  Count: 3

For central node 2:
 - <2, (1, 4, 8)>
  Count: 1

For central node 4:
 - <4, (0, 2, 6)>
 - <4, (2, 6, 7)>
  Count: 2

For central node 6:
 - <6, (0, 1, 4)>
 - <6, (0, 4, 7)>
  Count: 2

For central node 8:
 - <8, (2, 5, 7)>
  Count: 1

Total count of unique 3-stars: 3 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 12  
So, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
