Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (3, 1) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to node 0 as a star. This means we are looking for nodes that have an edge with node 0.

Nodes connected to node 0: 1, 2, 9

Now, for each of these nodes, we will check if they are connected to exactly two other nodes besides node 0, which would form a 3-star.

For node 1: Nodes connected to 1: 0, 3, 5, 7
Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 5, and 7. <1, (0, 5, 7)>

For node 2: Nodes connected to 2: 0
Node 2 does not form a 3-star.

For node 9: Nodes connected to 9: 0, 5
Node 9 does not form a 3-star.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1] and the 3-star is <1, (0, 5, 7)>.
