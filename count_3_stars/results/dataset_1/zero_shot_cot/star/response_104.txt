Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will serve as the central nodes of the 3-stars. We then look for the sets of nodes that are directly connected to each central node.

Given the edges provided, the central nodes connected to exactly three other nodes are: 0, 1, 3, 6, 8.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<3, (0, 1, 5)>
<6, (1, 7, 9)>
<8, (0, 3, 5)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
