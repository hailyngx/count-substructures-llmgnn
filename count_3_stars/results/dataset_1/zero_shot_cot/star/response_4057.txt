Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that form a 3-star in the given graph.

The nodes that are directly connected to node 0 (center) are 1, 2, 6, 7, and 9. Among these, we can see that nodes 1, 7, and 9 form a 3-star with node 0 as the center. 

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in this graph are <0, (1, 7, 9)>.

Counting the number of 3-stars found: [1]
