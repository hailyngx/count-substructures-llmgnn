Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first identify all the 3-stars (subgraphs with a central node connected to exactly three other nodes) present. 

Let's list the 3-stars we can find in the graph:

<1, (5, 7, 5)>
<3, (2, 8, 8)>
<5, (1, 6, 7)>
<8, (3, 4, 6)>

There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [4].
