Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify unique occurrences where one node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list down the 3-stars in the graph:

<1, (0, 5, 6)>
<3, (1, 4, 6)>
<7, (1, 2, 6)>
<9, (0, 5, 2)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
