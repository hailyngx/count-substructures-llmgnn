Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the 3-stars present. 

Let's go step-by-step:
1. Identify all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.
2. Check if they form a 3-star pattern with the central node and the other three nodes connected to it.
3. Count the unique 3-stars found.

Now, let's find the 3-stars:

1. Nodes connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 5, and 7.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 9.

2. Unique 3-star patterns:
- <0, (2, 4, 8)>
- <4, (0, 5, 7)>
- <7, (3, 4, 9)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3]. The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (2, 4, 8)>, <4, (0, 5, 7)>, <7, (3, 4, 9)>.
