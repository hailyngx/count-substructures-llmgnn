Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
Let's first identify the central nodes for each 3-star in the given graph:
- Node 0 has 2 edges connected to nodes 2 and 3.
- Node 1 has 3 edges connected to nodes 4, 5, and 8.
- Node 2 has 4 edges connected to nodes 0, 4, 8, and 9.
- Node 3 has 5 edges connected to nodes 0, 4, 5, 7, and 9.
- Node 4 has 6 edges connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, and 8.
- Node 5 has 4 edges connected to nodes 1, 3, 7.
- Node 6 has 1 edge connected to node 4.
- Node 7 has 3 edges connected to nodes 3, 4, 5.
- Node 8 has 3 edges connected to nodes 1, 2, 4.
- Node 9 has 2 edges connected to nodes 2, 3.

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- There are no 3-stars with Node 0 as the center.
- There is one 3-star with Node 1 as the center: <1, (4, 5, 8)>.
- There are no 3-stars with Node 2 as the center.
- There are two 3-stars with Node 3 as the center: <3, (0, 4, 5)> and <3, (4, 7, 9)>.
- There are three 3-stars with Node 4 as the center: <4, (1, 2, 8)>, <4, (2, 3, 8)>, and <4, (3, 5, 7)>.
- There are no 3-stars with Node 5 as the center.
- There are no 3-stars with Node 6 as the center.
- There is one 3-star with Node 7 as the center: <7, (3, 4, 5)>.
- There are no 3-stars with Node 8 as the center.
- There are no 3-stars with Node 9 as the center.

Therefore, there are a total of [7] 3-stars in the given graph.
