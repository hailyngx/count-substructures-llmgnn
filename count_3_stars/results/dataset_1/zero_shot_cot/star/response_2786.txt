Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are directly connected to each node:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 6, 7
- Node 1: 4, 8, 9
- Node 2: 0, 5
- Node 3: 0, 4
- Node 4: 1, 3, 6
- Node 5: 2, 6, 8
- Node 6: 0, 4, 5
- Node 7: 0, 8, 9
- Node 8: 1, 5, 7
- Node 9: 1, 7

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:

- The possible 3-star combinations are:
    - <0, (2, 3, 6)>
    - <0, (2, 6, 7)>
    - <1, (4, 8, 9)>
    - <4, (1, 3, 6)>
    - <5, (2, 6, 8)>
    - <5, (6, 4, 1)>
    - <6, (0, 4, 5)>
    - <6, (4, 1, 3)>
    - <6, (5, 8, 2)>
    - <7, (0, 8, 9)>
    - <8, (1, 5, 7)>
    - <9, (1, 7, 0)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is the number of unique combinations listed above, which is 12.
Therefore, the final answer is [12].
