Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star structures in the given graph. Since a 3-star has a center node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can look for nodes that satisfy this condition.

  - <0, (2, 6, 8)>
  - <1, (3, 4, 8)>
  - <2, (0, 3, 6)>
  - <3, (1, 2, 9)>
  - <4, (1, 5, 8)>
  - <5, (3, 4, 9)>
  - <6, (0, 2, 8)>
  - <8, (1, 4, 6)>
  - <9, (2, 3, 7)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
