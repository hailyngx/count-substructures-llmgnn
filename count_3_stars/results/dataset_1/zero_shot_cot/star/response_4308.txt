Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph.

1. Start by identifying the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These would be the central nodes of the 3-stars.

2. For each central node, identify the nodes that are directly connected to it. These nodes will be the leaves of the 3-stars.

3. Count the number of 3-stars found in the graph.

Following these steps, we find the following 3-stars:

<0, (2, 3, 9)>
<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<2, (0, 1, 5)>
<3, (0, 2, 8)>
<4, (1, 7, 9)>
<5, (2, 3, 7)>
<6, (1, 7, 9)>
<7, (4, 5, 6)>
<8, (3, 7, 9)>
<9, (1, 3, 6)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we get a total of [10].
