Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's go step by step:
1. Node 0 is not the center of any 3-star because it is only connected to one node.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 5 and 8. We see that it forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 5, and 8. So, we have one 3-star with center node 1.
3. Node 2 is not the center of any 3-star because it is only connected to one node.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 4 and 9. We see that it forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 4, and 9. So, we have one 3-star with center node 3.
5. Node 6 is not the center of any 3-star because it is only connected to one node.
6. Node 7 is not the center of any 3-star because it is only connected to one node.
7. Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, and 6. It forms two 3-stars: one with center node 8, and the other with center node 8.
8. Node 9 is not the center of any 3-star because it is connected to four nodes.

Thus, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2]. 

Unique 3-stars:
<1, (5, 8)>
<3, (4, 9)>
