Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all unique combinations of nodes that form 3-star structures (a central node connected to exactly three other nodes). 

First, let's list all the nodes in the graph: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}.

Now, we will examine each node to see if it is the center of a 3-star. If a node has exactly three edges emanating from it, we will check the nodes at the other ends of these edges to determine if they form a 3-star with the current node as the center.

Here are the 3-stars found in the given graph:
<0, (3, 9, 5)>
<1, (7, 8, 5)>
<2, (4, 6, 7)>
<3, (0, 5, 4)>
<4, (2, 5, 6)>
<5, (3, 8, 7)>
<6, (2, 4, 7)>
<7, (1, 2, 6)>
<8, (1, 5, 6)>
<9, (0, 2, 4)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
