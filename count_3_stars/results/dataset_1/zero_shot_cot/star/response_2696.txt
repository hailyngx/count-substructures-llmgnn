Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

The nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes are:
- Node 0 (connected to nodes 1, 6, 8)
- Node 1 (connected to nodes 0, 3, 6)
- Node 6 (connected to nodes 0, 1, 5)
- Node 8 (connected to nodes 0, 1, 4)

Now, we can count the number of unique 3-stars in the graph:

1. <0, (1, 6, 8)>
2. <1, (0, 3, 6)>
3. <6, (0, 1, 5)>
4. <8, (0, 1, 4)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
