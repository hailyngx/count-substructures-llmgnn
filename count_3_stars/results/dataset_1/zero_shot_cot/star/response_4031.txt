Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern. 

Let's go step-by-step:
1. Identify the central node and its connected nodes for each 3-star pattern.
2. Count the number of occurrences for each unique 3-star pattern.
3. Output the final count in brackets.

Let's start by listing the unique 3-stars:

<0, (7, 8, 5)>
<1, (2, 4, 9)>
<2, (1, 6, 9)>
<3, (4, 5, 8)>
<4, (1, 3, 9)>
<5, (3, 7, 8)>
<6, (2, 8, 9)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-star patterns in the given graph:

Total number of 3-stars: [7]
