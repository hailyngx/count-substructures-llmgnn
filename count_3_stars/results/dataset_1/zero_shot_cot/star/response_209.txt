Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 1 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 8.
2. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 5.
3. Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 8.
4. Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 5.
5. Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 7, and 8.
6. Node 7 is connected to nodes 6 and 8.
7. Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 6, and 7.

Hence, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].

Unique 3-stars:
<1, (4, 6, 8)>
<2, (0, 3, 5)>
<3, (2, 4, 8)>
<4, (1, 3, 5)>
<6, (1, 7, 8)>
<7, (6, 8)>
<8, (1, 3, 6, 7)>
