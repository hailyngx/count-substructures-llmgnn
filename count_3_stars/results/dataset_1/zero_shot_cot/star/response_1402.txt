Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 5, 7)>
<0, (5, 7, 9)>
<1, (3, 4, 6)>
<3, (1, 6, 8)>
