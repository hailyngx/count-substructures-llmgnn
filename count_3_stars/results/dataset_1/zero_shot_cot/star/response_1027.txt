Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
Let's first identify all the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (3, 9), 1>
2. <1, (5, 7, 8), 9>
3. <4, (6, 7, 9), 1>
4. <8, (1, 3, 5), 9>
5. <9, (0, 1, 4), 0>

There are a total of 5 unique 3-stars in the graph. Therefore, the final answer is [5].
