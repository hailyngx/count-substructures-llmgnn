Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

- Node 0: (0, 3, 6)
- Node 3: (3, 0, 9)
- Node 4: (4, 1, 6)
- Node 6: (6, 0, 4)
- Node 9: (9, 3, 6)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].  
The unique 3-stars found are <0, (3, 6)>, <3, (0, 9)>, <4, (1, 6)>, <6, (0, 4)>, <9, (3, 6)>.
