Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all unique sets of nodes that form a 3-star pattern. 

Let's list all the 3-stars we can find in the graph:
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<1, (0, 4, 6)>
<2, (4, 6, 7)>
<4, (0, 1, 2)>
<6, (1, 2, 3)>
<7, (2, 3, 4)>
<9, (0, 4, 8)>

Now that we have identified all the 3-stars in the graph, we count the total number of unique 3-stars, which is 7.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
