Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star pattern, i.e., a central node connected to exactly three leaves. 

From the given edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:
1. Central node: 1, Leaves: 2, 5, 7
2. Central node: 2, Leaves: 1, 4, 5
3. Central node: 5, Leaves: 1, 2, 7
4. Central node: 7, Leaves: 1, 5, 8
5. Central node: 8, Leaves: 5, 7, 9
6. Central node: 9, Leaves: 0, 6, 8

Count of 3-stars = 6

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in this graph is [6].

Unique 3-stars found:
<1, (2, 5, 7)>
<2, (1, 4, 5)>
<5, (1, 2, 7)>
<7, (1, 5, 8)>
<8, (5, 7, 9)>
<9, (0, 6, 8)>
