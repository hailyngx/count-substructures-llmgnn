Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the 3-stars present. 

Let's analyze the graph:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
- (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 7)
- (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8)
- (2, 1), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 8)
- (3, 4), (3, 9)
- (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 8)
- (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 9)
- (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 8)
- (7, 0), (7, 1)
- (8, 1), (8, 2), (8, 4), , (8, 6)
- (9, 3), (9, 5)

Let's list the 3-stars:

<0, (4, 5, 7)>
<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<2, (1, 5, 8)>
<3, (4, 9)>
<4, (0, 1, 3)>
<5, (0, 2, 9)>
<6, (1, 2, 8)>
<7, (0, 1)>
<8, (1, 2, 4)>
<9, (3, 5)>

Therefore, there are a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
