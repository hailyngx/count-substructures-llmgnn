Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, which consists of 10 nodes and 22 edges, we need to identify all instances where a node is the center and is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's identify the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (2, 5, 8)>
<1, (2, 9, -)>
<2, (0, 1, 8)>
<3, (7, 8, 9)>
<4, (7, -, -)>
<5, (0, 6, -)>
<6, (5, -, -)>
<7, (3, 4, -)>
<8, (0, 2, 3)>
<9, (1, 3, -)>

Counting the unique 3-stars identified above, we get a total of [9].
