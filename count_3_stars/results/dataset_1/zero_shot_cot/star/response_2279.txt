Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify the central node and the nodes connected to it. 

From the provided edges, we can see that the possible central nodes are 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9.

1. Central Node: 0
   - 0 is connected to nodes 5, 7, and 9. This forms a 3-star with central node 0 and leaves 5, 7, 9. <0, (5, 7, 9)>

2. Central Node: 2
   - 2 is connected to nodes 1 and 8. However, this doesn't form a valid 3-star since 2 is connected to only 2 nodes.

3. Central Node: 3
   - 3 is connected to nodes 7 and 8. This doesn't form a valid 3-star since 3 is connected to only 2 nodes.

4. Central Node: 4
   - 4 is connected to nodes 7 and 9. This doesn't form a valid 3-star since 4 is connected to only 2 nodes. 

5. Central Node: 5
   - 5 is connected to nodes 0 and 8. This doesn't form a valid 3-star since 5 is connected to only 2 nodes.

6. Central Node: 7
   - 7 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 4. This forms a 3-star with central node 7 and leaves 0, 3, 4. <7, (0, 3, 4)>

7. Central Node: 8
   - 8 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 5, and 9. This forms two 3-stars:
     - <8, (2, 3, 5)>
     - <8, (3, 5, 9)>

8. Central Node: 9
   - 9 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 8. This forms a 3-star with central node 9 and leaves 0, 4, 8. <9, (0, 4, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
