Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are:
<0, (5, 9, 3)>
<1, (3, 6, 8)>
<2, (6, 8, 9)>
<3, (1, 5, 9)>
<4, (8)>
<7, (9)>
Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
