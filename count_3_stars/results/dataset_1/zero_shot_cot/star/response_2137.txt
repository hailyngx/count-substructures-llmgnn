Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (4, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's start by identifying the nodes with their connections:

Node 0: 6, 7  
Node 1: 2  
Node 2: 1, 6, 7  
Node 3: 6  
Node 4: 6  
Node 5: 7  
Node 6: 0, 2, 3, 4, 9  
Node 7: 0, 2, 5  
Node 9: 6  

Now let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph.

[(0, 6, 7), (2, 1, 7), (6, 0, 2), (6, 2, 7)]  
[(2, 1, 6), (2, 6, 7), (6, 0, 7), (6, 2, 7)]  
[(6, 3, 4), (6, 4, 9)]  
[(0, 6, 2), (2, 6, 7), (6, 0, 7)]  
[(2, 1, 0), (2, 0, 7), (6, 0, 7)]  

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is: [5]  

List of unique 3-stars:  
<0, (6, 7, 2)>  
<2, (1, 6, 7)>  
<6, (0, 2, 7)>  
<6, (3, 4, 9)>  
<2, (0, 1, 7)>
