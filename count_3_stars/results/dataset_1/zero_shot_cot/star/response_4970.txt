Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 5, and 8: <0, (1, 5, 8)>
2. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 4, and 6: <1, (0, 4, 6)>
3. Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 6, and 9: <2, (4, 6, 9)>
4. Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 8, and 9: <3, (6, 8, 9)>
5. Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 2, and 6: <4, (1, 2, 6)>
6. Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 9, and 7: <5, (0, 9, 7)>
7. Node 6 forms 3-stars with nodes 1, 2, and 4: <6, (1, 2, 4)> and <6, (1, 2, 3)> and <6, (3, 4, 2)>
8. Node 7 does not form a 3-star since it is connected to only one node.
9. Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 3, and 9: <8, (0, 3, 9)>
10. Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, and 5: <9, (0, 1, 5)> and forms 3-stars with nodes 2, 7, and 5: <9, (2, 7, 5)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
