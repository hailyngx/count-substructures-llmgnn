Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we can identify which nodes are connected to each node in the graph. This information will help us identify the 3-stars in the graph. 

- Node 0 is connected to node 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 7.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 7, and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 6, 7, and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to node 4.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 2 and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 7, and 8.

Next, we can count the number of 3-stars in the graph. 

Given that a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can list the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<1, (2, 4, 7)>
<9, (0, 4, 7)>
<2, (1, 7, 8)>
<4, (1, 7, 9)>
<7, (1, 2, 4)>
<8, (2, 9, 1)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
