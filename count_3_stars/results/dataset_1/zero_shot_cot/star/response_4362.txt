Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
Let's first determine the nodes that are directly connected to each node:

0: 2, 6, 8  
1: 5, 9  
2: 0, 3, 7, 9  
3: 2, 4, 7, 9  
4: 3, 6, 7  
5: 1  
6: 0, 4, 8  
7: 2, 3, 4  
8: 0, 6  
9: 1, 2, 3

Now, we will check each node if it forms a 3-star graph where it is connected to exactly three other nodes.

The 3-star graphs in this given graph are:
<0, (2, 6, 8)>
<1, (5, 9, -)>
<2, (0, 3, 7)>
<3, (2, 4, 7)>
<4, (3, 6, 7)>
<5, (1, -, -)>
<6, (0, 4, 8)>
<7, (2, 3, 4)>
<8, (0, 6, -)>
<9, (1, 2, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [10].
