Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that are connected to node 1 since node 1 can be the center of a 3-star.

Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 9. 

Now we look for pairs of nodes connected to both node 1 and each other to form 3-stars.

The possible 3-stars involving node 1 are:
<1, (2, 7, 9)>
<1, (3, 6, -)>
<1, (4, 5, -)>
<1, (7, 2, -)>
<1, (9, 2, -)>

Now, we need to count the total number of 3-stars in the graph.
