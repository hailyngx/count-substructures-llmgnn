Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible configurations where the center node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step-by-step:

1. The nodes that fulfill the conditions to be the center of a 3-star are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, and 9. Nodes 0 and 5 do not have enough connections to form a 3-star.

2. Next, we look for each eligible center node and check all possible combinations of three connected nodes to form a 3-star.

Based on the given graph, the 3-stars are: <1, (3, 7, 8)>, <2, (4, 8, 9)>, <3, (1, 4, 8)>, <4, (2, 3, 8)>, <7, (1, 3, 5)>, <8, (1, 2, 3)>, <8, (3, 5, 9)>, <9, (2, 3, 8)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
