Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) 

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are as follows:
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<0, (3, 5, 9)>
<3, (0, 6, 8)>
<5, (0, 7, 8)>
<6, (0, 2, 7)>
<7, (0, 1, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
