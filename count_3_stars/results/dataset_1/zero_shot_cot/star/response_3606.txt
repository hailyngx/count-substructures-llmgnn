Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: Determine the center nodes in the graph.  
- Based on the definition of a 3-star graph, the nodes with exactly three neighbors are potential center nodes.

0 -> (1, 4, 8)
1 -> (0, 4, 8, 9)
2 -> (5, 6)
3 -> (4, 5, 6)
4 -> (0, 1, 3, 5, 9)
5 -> (2, 3, 4, 9)
6 -> (2, 3, 7, 8)
7 -> (6)
8 -> (0, 1, 6)
9 -> (1, 4, 5)

Based on the neighbors, the potential center nodes are 0, 1, 4, and 6.

Step 2: Count the number of 3-stars.
- For each potential center node, check if it forms a valid 3-star with its neighbors.

For center node 0: (0, 1, 4), (0, 1, 8), (0, 4, 8) => 3-stars = <0, (1, 4, 8)>
For center node 1: (1, 0, 4), (1, 0, 8), (1, 4, 8), (1, 4, 9) => 3-stars = <1, (0, 4, 8)>
For center node 4: (4, 0, 1), (4, 0, 3), (4, 0, 5), (4, 0, 9), (4, 1, 3), (4, 1, 5), (4, 1, 9), (4, 3, 5), (4, 5, 9) => 3-stars = <4, (0, 1, 5)>
For center node 6: (6, 2, 3), (6, 2, 7), (6, 2, 8), (6, 3, 7), (6, 3, 8) => 3-stars = <6, (2, 3, 7)>

Step 3: Calculate the final answer.
- Count the total number of unique 3-stars found.
