Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (4, 5, 6)>  
2. <1, (2, 3, 4)>  
3. <2, (1, 3, 8)>  
4. <3, (1, 2, 8)>  
5. <4, (0, 1, 9)>  
6. <5, (0, 7, 9)>  
7. <6, (0, 2, 8)>  
8. <7, (2, 5, 8)>  
9. <8, (1, 2, 3)>  
10. <9, (4, 5)>

Therefore, there are 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph.  
So, the total number of 3-stars is [10].
