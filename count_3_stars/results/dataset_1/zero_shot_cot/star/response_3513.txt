Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to the central node with exactly three edges. These nodes will form the leaves of the 3-stars. 

- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, and 6.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, and 7.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, and 6.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph.

[There are 3 unique 3-stars in this graph.]

<7, (0, 1, 4)>
<8, (0, 1, 7)>
<9, (0, 1, 6)>
