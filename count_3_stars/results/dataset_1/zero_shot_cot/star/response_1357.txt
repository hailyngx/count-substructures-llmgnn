Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify nodes that are directly connected to node 0.  
Nodes directly connected to node 0: 1, 4, 7, 8  

Step 2: For each node identified in step 1, check if they are connected to exactly 2 other nodes besides node 0 to form a 3-star.  
- Nodes connected to 1: 0, 5, 6, 9 (not valid)  
- Nodes connected to 4: 0, 3, 6 (valid 3-star: <4, (0, 3, 6)>)  
- Nodes connected to 7: 0 (not valid)  
- Nodes connected to 8: 0, 2, 9 (not valid)  

Step 3: Count the total number of unique 3-stars identified in step 2 inside brackets.  
Total number of 3-stars: [1]  

Unique 3-stars:  
- <4, (0, 3, 6)>
