Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern. 

First, let's list all the 3-stars present in the graph:
<0, (6, 8, -)>
<1, (2, 5, -)>
<2, (1, 3, 4)>
<2, (1, 4, 7)>
<2, (3, 4, 7)>
<2, (4, 7, -)>
<5, (1, 7, 8)>
<7, (2, 3, 5)>
<7, (3, 5, 8)>
<7, (5, 8, 9)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars:
[9]
