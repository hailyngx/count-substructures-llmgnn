Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes with degree 3, which will be the centers of the 3-stars. 

- Node 1 has degree 3 and is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 8
- Node 2 has degree 4, so it is not a center
- Node 3 has degree 4, so it is not a center
- Node 5 has degree 4, so it is not a center
- Node 7 has degree 4, so it is not a center
- Node 9 has degree 4, so it is not a center

Therefore, the possible 3-star configurations are:
- <1, (0, 2, 8)>

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 1, so the answer is [1].
