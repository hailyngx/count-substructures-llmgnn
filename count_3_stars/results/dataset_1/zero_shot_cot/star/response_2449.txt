Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central nodes with exactly three connected nodes. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Identify all nodes with three edges connected:
   - Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 5.
   - Node 2 is connected to nodes 4 and 5.
   - Node 4 is connected to nodes 2 and 7.
   - Node 6 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 9.
   - Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 6, and 8.

2. Count the number of 3-stars:
   - There are 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (0, 3, 5)>
<2, (4, 5, *)>
<4, (2, 7, *)>
<6, (3, 5, 9)>
<9, (0, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
