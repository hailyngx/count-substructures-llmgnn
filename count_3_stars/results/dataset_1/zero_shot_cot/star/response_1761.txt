Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
Following the information given, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph.

The central node of a 3-star should be connected to exactly three other nodes. Here are the 3-stars in the given graph:
<0, (4, 8, 1)>
<1, (3, 9, 4)>
<2, (5, 6, 9)>
<3, (1, 9, 4)>
<4, (0, 1, 5)>
<5, (2, 4, 6)>
<6, (2, 5, 7)>
<7, (5, 6, 8)>
<8, (0, 7, 9)>
<9, (1, 2, 4)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
