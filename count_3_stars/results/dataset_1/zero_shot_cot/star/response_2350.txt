Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's start by listing all the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (7, 1, 7)>
<1, (7, 0, 7)>
<2, (6, 7, 8)>
<3, (9, 9, 9)>
<4, (8, 8, 8)>
<5, (6, 6, 6)>
<6, (2, 5, 7)>
<7, (0, 1, 2)>
<8, (2, 4, 8)>
<9, (3, 7, 7)>

Therefore, there are [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
