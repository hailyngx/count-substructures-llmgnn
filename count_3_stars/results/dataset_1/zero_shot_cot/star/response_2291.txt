Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with three other nodes connected to them. These nodes will serve as the central nodes for the 3-stars. The nodes with three connections are 0, 2, 5, 7, and 8.

Next, we will construct the 3-stars using these central nodes. For each central node, we will identify the three connected nodes as leaves.

1. For node 0: <0, (2, 5, 8)>
2. For node 2: <2, (0, 5, 8)>
3. For node 5: <5, (0, 1, 2)>
4. For node 7: <7, (1, 2, 8)>
5. For node 8: <8, (0, 2, 4)>

Now, count the total number of unique 3-stars: [5]. 

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
