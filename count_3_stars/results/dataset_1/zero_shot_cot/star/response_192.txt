Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes which are connected to node 0 to determine the number of 3-stars with node 0 as the central node:

Node 0: Connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, 7, and 9.

Now, let's list the 3-stars with node 0 as the central node:
<0, (1, 4, 9)>
<0, (3, 4, 7)>
<0, (4, 1, 6)>
<0, (7, 3, 9)>

Next, let's identify the nodes which are connected to node 1 to determine the number of 3-stars with node 1 as the central node:

Node 1: Connected to nodes 0, 2, and 4.

Now, let's list the 3-stars with node 1 as the central node:
<1, (0, 4, 9)>

There are no 3-stars with node 2 as the central node since it is connected to only three nodes.

Next, let's identify the nodes which are connected to node 3 to determine the number of 3-stars with node 3 as the central node:

Node 3: Connected to nodes 0, 7, 8, and 9.

Now, let's list the 3-stars with node 3 as the central node:
<3, (0, 7, 9)>

There are no 3-stars with node 4 as the central node since it is connected to four nodes.

Node 5, 6, and 8 don't have any 3-stars as none of them are connected to exactly three other nodes.

Finally, let's identify the nodes which are connected to node 7 to determine the number of 3-stars with node 7 as the central node:

Node 7: Connected to nodes 0, 3, 6, and 9.

Now, let's list the 3-stars with node 7 as the central node:
<7, (0, 3, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
