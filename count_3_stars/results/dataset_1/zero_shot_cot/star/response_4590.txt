Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars present in the graph. 

Let's list down the unique 3-stars that we can find in this graph: 
<1, (3, 6, 9)>
<3, (1, 6, 9)>
<6, (1, 3, 4)>
<9, (1, 3, 8)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph: 
[4]
