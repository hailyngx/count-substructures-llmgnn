Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of nodes that form a 3-star. Remember, each 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Here are the 3-stars in the given graph:
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<0, (1, 8, 9)>
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<1, (0, 5, 7)>
<2, (0, 1, 4)>
<3, (0, 1, 4)>
<4, (2, 3, 6)>
<4, (4, 7, 6)>
<8, (0, 6, 9)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars: [10].
