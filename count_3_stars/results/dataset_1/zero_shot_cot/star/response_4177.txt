Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (4, 5, 7)>
2. <1, (3, 4, 8)>
3. <3, (1, 7, 9)>
4. <4, (0, 1, 5)>
5. <5, (0, 4, 7)>
6. <7, (0, 3, 5)>
7. <8, (1, 4, 6)>
8. <9, (3, 4, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
