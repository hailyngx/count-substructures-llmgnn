Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 8.  
   <1, (3, 5, 8)>
   
2. Node 2 is connected to nodes 5, 7, and there is no other 3rd node connected to it, so no 3-star centered at node 2.

3. Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 8, and 9.
   <3, (1, 8, 9)>
   
4. Node 4 is connected to nodes 5, 7, and there is no other 3rd node connected to it, so no 3-star centered at node 4.

5. Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 4.
   <5, (1, 2, 4)>

6. Node 6 is connected to node 5 only, so no 3-star centered at node 6.

7. Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 5.
   <7, (2, 4, 5)>

8. Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 7.
   <8, (1, 3, 7)>

9. Node 9 is connected to nodes 3, 7, 8.
   <9, (3, 7, 8)>

Count of 3-stars: [5]  
Unique 3-stars: <1, (3, 5, 8)>, <3, (1, 8, 9)>, <5, (1, 2, 4)>, <7, (2, 4, 5)>, <8, (1, 3, 7)>, <9, (3, 7, 8)>
