Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we should look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 2: (2, 4, 8) - A 3-star with node 2 as the central node and nodes 4, 8 as the leaves.
2. Node 3: (3, 4, 7) - A 3-star with node 3 as the central node and nodes 4, 7 as the leaves.
3. Node 4: (4, 0, 3) - A 3-star with node 4 as the central node and nodes 0, 3 as the leaves.
4. Node 6: (6, 4, 9) - A 3-star with node 6 as the central node and nodes 4, 9 as the leaves.
5. Node 7: (7, 3, 5) - A 3-star with node 7 as the central node and nodes 3, 5 as the leaves.
6. Node 9: (9, 6, 7) - A 3-star with node 9 as the central node and nodes 6, 7 as the leaves.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (4, 8)>
<3, (4 ,7)>
<4, (0, 3)>
<6, (4, 9)>
<7, (3, 5)>
<9, (6, 7)>
