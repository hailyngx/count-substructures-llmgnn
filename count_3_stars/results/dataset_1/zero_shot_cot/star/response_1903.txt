Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Nodes connected to 0: (0, 2), (0, 3)
   - <0, (2, 3)>

2. Nodes connected to 1: (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 5), (1, 6)
   - <1, (2, 3, 5)>
   - <1, (2, 3, 6)>
   - <1, (3, 5, 6)>

3. Nodes connected to 2: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4)
   - <2, (0, 1, 4)>

4. Nodes connected to 3: (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 6), (3, 7)
   - <3, (0, 1, 6)>
   - <3, (1, 6, 7)>

5. Nodes connected to 4: (4, 2), (4, 7), (4, 9)
   - <4, (2, 7, 9)>

6. Nodes connected to 5: (5, 1), (5, 9)
   - No 3-stars with central node 5.

7. Nodes connected to 6: (6, 1), (6, 3)
   - No 3-stars with central node 6.

8. Nodes connected to 7: (7, 3), (7, 4)
   - No 3-stars with central node 7.

9. Nodes connected to 8: (8, 9)
   - No 3-stars with central node 8.

10. Nodes connected to 9: (9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 8)
   - <9, (4, 5, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
