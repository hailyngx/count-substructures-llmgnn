Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the given graph.

Now, let's list them:

<0, (4, 8, 9)>
<2, (3, 7, 8)>
<3, (2, 5, 6)>
<5, (3, 6, 7)>
<8, (0, 3, 4)>
<9, (4, 5, 7)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars gives us a total of [6].
