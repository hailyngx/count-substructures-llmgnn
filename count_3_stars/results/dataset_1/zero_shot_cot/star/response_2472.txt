Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to node 0:

- Node 0 is connected to node 6.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 5, and 7.

Thus, node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 5, and 7. Therefore, we have found our first 3-star: <0, (6, 5, 7)>.

Next, let's identify the nodes that are connected to node 1:

- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1 and 4.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 6.

Hence, node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 4, and 5. Therefore, we have found our second 3-star: <1, (2, 4, 5)>.

The graph contains a total of two unique 3-stars: <0, (6, 5, 7)> and <1, (2, 4, 5)>.

Therefore, the final answer is [2].
