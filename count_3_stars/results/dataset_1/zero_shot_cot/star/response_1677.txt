Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the nodes that form 3-star patterns.

From the given edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:
1. <0, (1, 8, 9)>
2. <1, (0, 5, 8)>
3. <2, (3, 4, 5)>
4. <4, (2, 8, 9)>
5. <5, (1, 2, -)>
6. <8, (0, 1, 4)>
7. <9, (0, 4, -)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
