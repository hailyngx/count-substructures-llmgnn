Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 5) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first identify the nodes that form 3-stars. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph step by step:

1. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 6, and 9: <1, (5, 6, 9)>
2. Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 8, and 1: <2, (6, 8, 1)>
3. Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 7, and 9: <5, (1, 7, 9)>
4. Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 2, and 4: <6, (1, 2, 4)>
5. Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 5, and 7: <9, (1, 5, 7)>

Therefore, there are a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
