Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph step by step:

1. Node 1 forms 3-stars with nodes (2, 3, 6) and (8, 6, 1).
2. Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes (1, 4, 7).
3. Node 1 also forms a 3-star with nodes (2, 0, 8).
4. Node 3 forms another 3-star with nodes (4, 7, 3).
5. Node 1 forms a final 3-star with nodes (6, 1, 8).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].

<1, (2, 3, 6)>, <1, (8, 6, 1)>, <3, (1, 4, 7)>, <1, (2, 0, 8)>, <3, (4, 7, 3)>
