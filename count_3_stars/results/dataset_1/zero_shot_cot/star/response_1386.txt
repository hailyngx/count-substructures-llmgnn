Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 6) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's start by identifying the nodes that make up 3-star structures in this graph:

1. Node 0: (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6)
2. Node 1: (1, 4), (1, 6)
3. Node 3: (3, 0), (3, 6)
4. Node 4: (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 7)
5. Node 5: (5, 0), (5, 6)
6. Node 6: (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 5), (6, 7), (6, 8), (6, 9)
7. Node 7: (7, 4), (7, 6), (7, 8)
8. Node 8: (8, 6), (8, 7)
9. Node 9: (9, 6)

Now, let's count the number of 3-star configurations:

1. <0, (3, 4, 5)> 
2. <0, (3, 6, 1)> 
3. <0, (4, 1, 7)> 
4. <0, (5, 6, 1)> 
5. <6, (1, 3, 0)> 
6. <6, (5, 7, 8)> 

[The total number of 3-star configurations in the given graph is 6.]
