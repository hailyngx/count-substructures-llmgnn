Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (6, 7, 9)>
<1, (4, 2, 9)>
<3, (4, 5, 6)>
<4, (1, 2, 3)>
<6, (0, 3, 9)>
<9, (1, 6, 7)>

Therefore, there are a total of [6] 3-stars in the graph.
