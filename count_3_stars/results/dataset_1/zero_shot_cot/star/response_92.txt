Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 1 as the central node: (1, 3, 4), (1, 3, 5), (1, 3, 6), (1, 3, 7), (1, 4, 2), (1, 4, 5), (1, 4, 7), (1, 5, 6), (1, 5, 1), (1, 6, 3), (1, 6, 9), (1, 7, 2)
- Node 2 as the central node: (2, 3, 1), (2, 3, 4), (2, 3, 7), (2, 3, 8), (2, 4, 1), (2, 4, 2), (2, 4, 7), (2, 4, 6), (2, 7, 1), (2, 7, 2), (2, 7, 4), (2, 8, 3)
- Node 3 as the central node: (3, 0, 8), (3, 1, 4), (3, 1, 5), (3, 1, 6), (3, 1, 7), (3, 2, 4), (3, 2, 7), (3, 2, 8), (3, 3, 6), (3, 3, 9), (3, 6, 9)
- Node 4 as the central node: (4, 1, 3), (4, 1, 5), (4, 1, 6), (4, 1, 7), (4, 2, 3), (4, 2, 7), (4, 2, 4), (4, 2, 6), (4, 7, 2)
- Node 6 as the central node: (6, 1, 3), (6, 1, 5), (6, 1, 7), (6, 1, 9), (6, 3, 1), (6, 3, 9), (6, 9, 3)
- Node 7 as the central node: (7, 1, 3), (7, 1, 4), (7, 1, 6), (7, 1, 2), (7, 2, 3), (7, 2, 4), (7, 2, 7), (7, 4, 2)

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [22]. 
The unique 3-stars are <1, (3, 4, 5)>, <1, (3, 5, 6)>, <1, (3, 6, 7)>, <1, (4, 2, 7)>, <1, (4, 5, 1)>, <1, (6, 9, 1)>, <2, (3, 7, 1)>, <2, (4, 2, 6)>, <2, (7, 4, 2)>, <3, (0, 8, 3)>, <3, (3, 9, 6)>, <4, (1, 7, 2)>, <6, (1, 5, 7)>
