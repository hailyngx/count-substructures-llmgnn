Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph. 

Looking at the edges, we can see that nodes 0, 1, 3, and 8 do not form any 3-stars as they have less than 3 adjacent nodes.

Now, let's identify the 3-stars involving the remaining nodes:

- Node 2 forms the following 3-stars: <2, (0, 1, 5)>, <2, (0, 7, 8)>, <2, (1, 5, 7)>, and <2, (5, 7, 8)>.
- Node 4 forms the following 3-stars: <4, (1, 3, 9)>, and <4, (3, 9, 5)>.
- Node 5 forms the following 3-stars: <5, (2, 7, 9)>.
- Node 6 forms the following 3-stars: <6, (0, 3, 9)>, <6, (3, 7, 9)>, <6, (7, 8, 9)>, and <6, (7, 9, 5)>.
- Node 7 forms the following 3-stars: <7, (2, 3, 5)>.

Therefore, there are a total of 12 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
Hence, the final answer is [12].
