Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the nodes that are directly connected to each node:

Node 0: 1, 4, 7, 8, 9
Node 1: 0, 4, 5, 6, 7
Node 2: 4, 8
Node 3: 7
Node 4: 0, 1, 2, 5, 7
Node 5: 1, 4, 7
Node 6: 1, 9
Node 7: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 8
Node 8: 0, 2, 7
Node 9: 0, 6

Next, we can identify the 3-stars present in the graph. 
Following the definition of a 3-star where the center node is connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 0 can form 3-stars with nodes (1, 4, 7), (1, 8, 9)
- Node 1 can form 3-stars with nodes (0, 5, 7), (0, 6, 9)
- Node 4 can form a 3-star with nodes (0, 2, 5)
- Node 7 can form a 3-star with nodes (3, 8, 5)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6]. 

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 4, 7)>
<0, (1, 8, 9)>
<1, (0, 5, 7)>
<1, (0, 6, 9)>
<4, (0, 2, 5)>
<7, (3, 8, 5)>
