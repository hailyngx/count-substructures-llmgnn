Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all the unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's determine the number of 3-stars:

<0, (5, 7, 9)>
<2, (6, 7, 9)>
<4, (5, 6, 9)>
<5, (0, 4, 9)>
<6, (2, 4, 9)>
<7, (0, 2, 8)>
<9, (0, 1, 5)>

Hence, the total number of 3-stars present in the graph is [7].
