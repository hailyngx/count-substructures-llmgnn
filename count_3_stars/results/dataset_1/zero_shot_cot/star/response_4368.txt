Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will be the central nodes of the 3-stars.

In this graph, the central nodes are nodes 0, 1, and 7 because each of them is connected to exactly three other nodes. Next, we determine the leaves of the 3-stars formed by these central nodes.

For node 0, the leaves are nodes 3, 5, and 7. So, there is one 3-star centered at node 0: <0, (3, 5, 7)>.

For node 1, the leaves are nodes 3, 5, and 6. So, there is one 3-star centered at node 1: <1, (3, 5, 6)>.

For node 7, the leaves are nodes 0, 1, and 5. However, we have already counted the 3-star centered at nodes 0 and 1. Therefore, the 3-star centered at node 7 is already included in the counts for nodes 0 and 1.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2]. 

<0, (3, 5, 7)>, <1, (3, 5, 6)>
