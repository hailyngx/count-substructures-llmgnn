Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 1: (1, 3), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8)
2. Node 2: (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 8)
3. Node 3: (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 5), (3, 7), (3, 8)
4. Node 4: (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 8)
5. Node 5: (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (5, 9)
6. Node 6: (6, 1), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 7)
7. Node 7: (7, 1), (7, 3), (7, 6)
8. Node 8: (8, 1), (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 4)
9. Node 9: (9, 5)

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the graph are as follows:
<1, (3, 6, 7)>
<2, (3, 5, 8)>
<3, (1, 2, 7)>
<4, (5, 6, 8)>
<5, (2, 3, 4)>
<6, (1, 4, 7)>
<7, (1, 3, 6)>
<8, (1, 2, 4)>
<9, (5)>

Finally, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
