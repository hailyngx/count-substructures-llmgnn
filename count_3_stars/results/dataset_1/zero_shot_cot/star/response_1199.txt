Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars based on the given edges. 

Let's start by listing all the unique 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (3, 5, 7)>
<1, (6, 5, 2)>
<2, (5, 7, 9)>
<3, (0, 5, 7)>
<4, (5, 6, -)>
<5, (2, 3, 4)>
<6, (1, 5, 9)>
<7, (2, 3, 6)>
<9, (2, 6, -)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars by counting the unique 3-stars we identified:
[9]
