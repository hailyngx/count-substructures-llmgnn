Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph:

<0, (3, 8, 1)>
<1, (3, 4, 7)>
<2, (4, 5, 6)>
<3, (0, 1, 4)>
<4, (1, 2, 9)>
<5, (2, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [6].
