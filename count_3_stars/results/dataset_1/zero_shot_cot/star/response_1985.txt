Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (2, 5, 8)>
2. <1, (2, 4, 6)>
3. <2, (0, 1, 8)>
4. <4, (1, 2, 6)>
5. <5, (0, 6, -)>
6. <6, (1, 4, 5)>
7. <8, (0, 2, -)>

Count of 3-star graphs: [7]
