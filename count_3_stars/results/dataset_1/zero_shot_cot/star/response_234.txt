Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. The center node 0 has leaves 4, 7, and 8. <0, (4, 7, 8)>
2. The center node 1 has leaves 6 and 9. <1, (6, 9)>
3. The center node 2 has leaf 4. <2, (4)>
4. The center node 5 has leaves 3 and 8. <5, (3, 8)>
5. The center node 9 has leaves 1, 7, and 8. <9, (1, 7, 8)>

So, there are a total of 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [5].
