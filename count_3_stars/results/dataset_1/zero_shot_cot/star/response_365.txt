Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
The central node of a 3-star graph will have 3 edges connected to it. Let's identify the central nodes first:

Central nodes: 1, 4, 7, 8

Now, let's find the leaves connected to each central node:

Central node 1:
Leaves: 0, 2, 3, 7, 8
<1, (0, 3, 8)>
<1, (0, 2, 7)>
<1, (0, 3, 7)>
<1, (2, 3, 8)>
<1, (2, 7, 8)>

Central node 4:
Leaves: 5, 7, 8
<4, (5, 7, 8)>

Central node 7:
Leaves: 0, 1, 3, 4
<7, (0, 1, 3)>
<7, (0, 3, 4)>
<7, (1, 3, 4)>

Central node 8:
Leaves: 1, 4, 9
<8, (1, 4, 9)>

Count of 3-stars [9] 
Unique 3-stars: <1, (0, 3, 8)>, <1, (0, 2, 7)>, <1, (0, 3, 7)>, <1, (2, 3, 8)>, <1, (2, 7, 8)>, <4, (5, 7, 8)>, <7, (0, 1, 3)>, <7, (0, 3, 4)>, <8, (1, 4, 9)>
