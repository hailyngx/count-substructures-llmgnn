Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern and count how many instances of each pattern exist in the graph.

Given the edges provided, we can identify the 3-star patterns as follows:

<0, (8, 6, 8)>
<1, (7, 5, 7)>
<3, (5, 6, 5)>
<4, (6, 5, 6)>
<5, (3, 6, 7)>
<6, (4, 5, 8)>
<7, (1, 5, 9)>
<8, (0, 6, 7)>
<9, (7, 7, 0)>

Now, we count the number of instances of each unique 3-star pattern in the graph:

<0, (8, 6, 8)> - 1 instance
<1, (7, 5, 7)> - 1 instance
<3, (5, 6, 5)> - 1 instance
<4, (6, 5, 6)> - 1 instance
<5, (3, 6, 7)> - 1 instance
<6, (4, 5, 8)> - 1 instance
<7, (1, 5, 9)> - 1 instance
<8, (0, 6, 7)> - 1 instance
<9, (7, 7, 0)> - 1 instance

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9]. 

This can be represented as follows:
<[0, (8, 6, 8)], [1, (7, 5, 7)], [3, (5, 6, 5)], [4, (6, 5, 6)], [5, (3, 6, 7)], [6, (4, 5, 8)], [7, (1, 5, 9)], [8, (0, 6, 7)], [9, (7, 7, 0)]>
