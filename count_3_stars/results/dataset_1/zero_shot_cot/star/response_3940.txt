Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, let's analyze the given graph to identify the 3-stars. In a 3-star graph, the center node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

To make it easier, let's list the neighbors of each node based on the provided edges:
- Node 0: 1, 5, 7, 9
- Node 1: 0, 3, 4, 5, 7
- Node 2: 4
- Node 3: 1, 7
- Node 4: 1, 2, 5
- Node 5: 0, 1, 4, 7
- Node 7: 0, 1, 3, 5
- Node 9: 0

Now, we can start identifying the 3-stars: 

- <0, (1, 5, 7)>
- <1, (0, 5, 7)>
- <5, (0, 1, 4)>
- <7, (0, 1, 3)>

Count of 3-stars: [4]
