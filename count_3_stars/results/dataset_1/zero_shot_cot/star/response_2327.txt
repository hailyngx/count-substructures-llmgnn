Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the node degrees based on the given edges:
- Node 0: degree 1
- Node 1: degree 1
- Node 2: degree 2
- Node 3: degree 5
- Node 4: degree 1
- Node 5: degree 5
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 2
- Node 8: degree 4
- Node 9: degree 2

Next, we need to identify the 3-stars in the graph. 
Let's start by listing the 3-stars:
- <0, (3, 5, 8)>
- <1, (6, 2, 9)>
- <2, (6, 5, 9)>
- <3, (0, 5, 7)>
- <5, (3, 4, 6)>
- <6, (1, 2, 5)>
- <7, (3, 8, 9)>
- <8, (3, 5, 6)>
- <9, (2, 7, 6)>

Counting the unique 3-stars found, we have a total of [9].
