Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars. 

Let's start by listing the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (2, 4, 7)>
<0, (2, 7, 8)>
<0, (4, 7, 8)>
<3, (4, 5, 6)>
<3, (4, 6, 9)>
<3, (5, 6, 7)>
<3, (5, 7, 8)>
<3, (6, 7, 9)>
<6, (1, 2, 3)>
<6, (1, 3, 8)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we get a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
