Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to each node:
- Node 0: 7
- Node 1: 3, 4, 5
- Node 2: 4
- Node 3: 1, 5
- Node 4: 1, 2, 8, 9
- Node 5: 1, 3
- Node 6: 7
- Node 7: 0, 6
- Node 8: 4
- Node 9: 4

Next, let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:
- There are no 3-star centered at node 0.
- There is one 3-star centered at node 1: <1, (3, 4, 5)>
- There is one 3-star centered at node 4: <4, (1, 2, 8)>
- There is one 3-star centered at node 7: <7, (0, 6, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3]. The unique 3-stars are <1, (3, 4, 5)>, <4, (1, 2, 8)>, and <7, (0, 6, 2)>.
