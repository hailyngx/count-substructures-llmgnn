Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all possible instances of 3-stars. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Here are the 3-stars found in the given graph:
<0, (7, 8, 9)>
<1, (2, 3, 8)>
<2, (1, 4, 8)>
<3, (1, 7, 9)>
<8, (0, 1, 2)>
<9, (0, 2, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
