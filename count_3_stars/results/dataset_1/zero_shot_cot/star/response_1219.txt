Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. We can do this by examining each node and its neighboring nodes to see if they form a 3-star.

Let's go through the nodes to find all the 3-stars:

- Node 0: (0, 3, 8) forms a 3-star.
- Node 1: (1, 4, 5) forms a 3-star.
- Node 2: (2, 4, 5) forms a 3-star.
- Node 3: (3, 0, 4) forms a 3-star.
- Node 4: (4, 1, 2) forms a 3-star.
- Node 5: (5, 1, 2) forms a 3-star.
- Node 6: (6, 1, 3) forms a 3-star.
- Node 8: (8, 0, 2) forms a 3-star.
- Node 9: (9, 6, 8) forms a 3-star.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <0, (3, 8), 1, (4, 5), 2, (4, 5), 6, (1, 3), 9, (6, 8)>.

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
