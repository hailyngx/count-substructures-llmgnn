Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars present in the graph.

Looking at the provided edge list, we can see that the central node of a 3-star is the node with the highest degree (i.e., the node that is connected to the most other nodes). In this case, node 0 has the highest degree with 4 edges connected to it. 

Now, let's identify all the 3-stars:

1. **<0, (1, 2, 4)>**
2. **<1, (0, 7, 9)>**
3. **<2, (0, 9, 4)>**
4. **<4, (0, 8, 9)>**
5. **<5, (0, 6, -)>**
6. **<6, (5, 8, 9)>**
7. **<7, (1, 9, -)>**
8. **<8, (4, 6, -)>**
9. **<9, (2, 4, 6)>**

There are 9 unique 3-stars identified. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is **[9]**.
