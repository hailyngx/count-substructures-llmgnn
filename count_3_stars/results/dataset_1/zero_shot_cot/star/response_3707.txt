Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's go through each node and check if it forms a 3-star:

1. Node 0: (0, 2), (0, 7), (0, 8) - Forms a 3-star <0, (2, 7, 8)>.
2. Node 1: (1, 2), (1, 6), (1, 8) - Forms a 3-star <1, (2, 6, 8)>.
3. Node 2: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 9) - Forms a 3-star <2, (0, 1, 9)>.
4. Node 3: (3, 5), (3, 6) - Does not form a 3-star.
5. Node 4: (4, 7), (4, 9) - Does not form a 3-star.
6. Node 5: (5, 3), (5, 6) - Does not form a 3-star.
7. Node 6: (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 5), (6, 7) - Forms two 3-stars <6, (1, 3, 5)> and <6, (3, 5, 7)>.
8. Node 7: (7, 0), (7, 4), (7, 6), (7, 9) - Forms one 3-star <7, (0, 4, 9)>.
9. Node 8: (8, 0), (8, 1) - Does not form a 3-star.
10. Node 9: (9, 2), (9, 4), (9, 7) - Forms a 3-star <9, (2, 4, 7)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6] and they are:
<0, (2, 7, 8)>, <1, (2, 6, 8)>, <2, (0, 1, 9)>, <6, (1, 3, 5)>, <6, (3, 5, 7)>, <7, (0, 4, 9)>.
