Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star pattern. 

Let's go step by step:

1. Start by listing all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 6, and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 7.

2. Note that for a 3-star to exist, a node must have exactly three neighbors. From the above list, only Node 4 satisfies this condition.

3. Now, let's list all unique 3-stars in the given graph:
<4, (0, 3, 6)>
<4, (0, 3, 9)>
<4, (0, 6, 9)>
<4, (3, 6, 9)>
<4, (0, 6, 3)>
<4, (0, 9, 3)>
<4, (6, 9, 3)>

4. Count the total number of unique 3-stars found: [7]

Therefore, the final answer is [7].
