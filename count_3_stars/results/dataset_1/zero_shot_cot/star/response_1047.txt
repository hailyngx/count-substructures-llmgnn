Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central node of each 3-star. Since each 3-star has a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can search for nodes that satisfy this condition.

Central nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8

Now, we can find the 3-stars in the given graph by checking the neighbors of each central node. For a 3-star to exist, the central node must be connected to exactly three other nodes.

- For central node 0: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) form a 3-star <0, (4, 6, 8)>
- For central node 1: (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) form a 3-star <1, (2, 5, 7)>
- For central node 2: (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) form a 3-star <2, (1, 8, 9)>
- For central node 5: (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) form a 3-star <5, (1, 3, 8)>
- For central node 7: (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) form a 3-star <7, (1, 3, 4)>
- For central node 8: (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) form a 3-star <8, (0, 2, 5)>

Count of 3-stars: [5]
Unique 3-stars: <0, (4, 6, 8)>, <1, (2, 5, 7)>, <2, (1, 8, 9)>, <5, (1, 3, 8)>, <7, (1, 3, 4)>
