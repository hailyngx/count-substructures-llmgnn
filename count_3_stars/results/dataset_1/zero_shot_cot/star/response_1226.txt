Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
The central node of each 3-star must have degree 3, meaning it must be connected to exactly 3 other nodes. Let's find all the 3-stars in the graph.

From the given information:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 5.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 5, and 7.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 7, and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 5, and 8.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, and 7.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0 and 5.

We can see that node 0 and node 2 both have degree 6, which means they cannot be central nodes of 3-stars. The possible central nodes for 3-stars in this graph are: 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9.

Let's go through these potential central nodes:
1. Central node 1:
   - (1, 2) and (1, 4) are edges, but (1, 5) is missing. So, no 3-star with 1 as the central node.
   
2. Central node 3:
   - (3, 0), (3, 7), and (3, 8) form a 3-star. <3, (0, 7, 8)>

3. Central node 4:
   - (4, 0), (4, 1), and (4, 5) form a 3-star. <4, (0, 1, 5)>

4. Central node 5:
   - (5, 1), (5, 2), and (5, 4) form a 3-star. <5, (1, 2, 4)>
   - (5, 9) is an additional isolated edge.

5. Central node 7:
   - (7, 0), (7, 2), and (7, 3) form a 3-star. <7, (0, 2, 3)>
   
6. Central node 8:
   - (8, 0), (8, 3), and (8, 4) form a 3-star. <8, (0, 3, 4)>

7. Central node 9:
   - (9, 0) is an isolated node.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the graph are: <<3, (0, 7, 8)>, <4, (0, 1, 5)>, <5, (1, 2, 4)>, <7, (0, 2, 3)>, <8, (0, 3, 4)>>. 
The number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
