Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique occurrences of 3-stars. 

Let's first identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes (leaves) in the graph:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 6, and 7.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 4.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 8.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 6.

Now, we can list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<1, (2, 5, 8)>
<2, (1, 6, 7)>
<6, (2, 3, 4)>
<7, (2, 3, 8)>
<9, (2, 5, 6)>

There are 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph, which means the answer is [5].
