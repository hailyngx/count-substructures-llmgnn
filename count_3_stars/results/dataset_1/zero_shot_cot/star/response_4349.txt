Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible combinations where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star-like pattern. 

Looking at the given edges, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:

<1, (4, 5, 6)>
<3, (4, 7, X)> (This 3-star is incomplete as it only has 2 leaves instead of 3)
<4, (1, 3, X)> (This 3-star is incomplete as it only has 2 leaves instead of 3)
<5, (1, 6, 7)>
<6, (1, 5, 8)>
<7, (3, 5, 9)>

Count of 3-stars: [5]
Unique 3-stars: <1, (4, 5, 6)>, <3, (4, 7, X)>, <4, (1, 3, X)>, <5, (1, 6, 7)>, <6, (1, 5, 8)>, <7, (3, 5, 9)>
