Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars present. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Let's identify the 3-stars:
1. <1, (4, 6, 7)>
2. <1, (4, 6, 8)>
3. <1, (6, 7, 8)>
4. <1, (4, 7, 8)>
5. <1, (4, 6, 8)>
6. <1, (4, 7, 8)>
7. <1, (6, 7, 8)>
8. <4, (1, 6, 8)>
9. <4, (1, 6, 8)>
10. <4, (1, 6, 8)>
11. <4, (1, 6, 8)>
12. <6, (1, 4, 8)>
13. <6, (1, 4, 8)>
14. <6, (1, 4, 8)>
15. <6, (1, 4, 8)>
16. <8, (1, 4, 6)>
17. <8, (1, 4, 6)>
18. <8, (1, 4, 7)>
19. <8, (1, 6, 7)>
20. <8, (4, 6, 7)>
21. <8, (1, 6, 7)>
22. <8, (4, 6, 7)>
23. <8, (1, 4, 7)>
24. <8, (1, 4, 6)>

There are 24 different 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [24].
