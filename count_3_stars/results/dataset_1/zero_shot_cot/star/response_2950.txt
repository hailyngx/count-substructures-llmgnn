Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
Let's first identify all the 3-stars in the given graph.

Starting from the first node, we can list down all the 3-star configurations:

1. From node 0: \<0, (4, 6, 0)\>
2. From node 1: \<1, (3, 4, 5)\>
3. From node 2: \<2, (3, 5, 9)\>
4. From node 3: \<3, (1, 2, 5)\>
5. From node 4: \<4, (1, 7, 9)\>
6. From node 5: \<5, (1, 2, 3)\>
7. From node 6: \<6, (0, 2, 8)\>
8. From node 7: \<7, (2, 4, 5)\>
9. From node 8: \<8, (4, 6, 8)\>
10. From node 9: \<9, (1, 2, 4)\>

These are all the unique 3-stars that can be formed in the given graph.

Counting the total number of 3-stars: [10]
