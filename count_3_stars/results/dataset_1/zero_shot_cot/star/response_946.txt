Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the possible combinations of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's go through the steps:

1. Identify the nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them. These nodes can potentially be at the center of a 3-star.
   
2. For each of these nodes, check if the nodes connected to it form a 3-star pattern. A 3-star pattern is when the central node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's go through these steps:

1. Nodes with exactly three edges connected to them:  
    - Node 0 (connected to nodes 7, 8, and not relevant for a 3-star)
    - Node 1 (connected to nodes 2, 5, 6)
    - Node 2 (connected to nodes 1, 4, 9)
    - Node 3 (connected to nodes 5, 8, not relevant for a 3-star)
    - Node 4 (connected to nodes 2, 6, not relevant for a 3-star)
    - Node 5 (connected to nodes 1, 3, not relevant for a 3-star)
    - Node 6 (connected to nodes 1, 4, not relevant for a 3-star)
    - Node 7 (connected to nodes 0, 9, not relevant for a 3-star)
    - Node 8 (connected to nodes 0, 3, 9)
    - Node 9 (connected to nodes 2, 7, 8)

2. From the above analysis, we see that the pairs (1, 2, 9) and (8, 9, 2) form 3-stars.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars are:  
<1, (2, 5, 6)>  
<2, (1, 4, 9)>  
<9, (8, 2, 7)>  

Count of 3-stars: [3]
