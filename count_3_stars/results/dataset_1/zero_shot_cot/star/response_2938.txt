Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the nodes that are the center of a potential 3-star. 
Since a 3-star has 4 nodes, we need to find nodes that have exactly 3 edges connected to them. Based on the given edges, nodes 0, 9, 2, 3, and 8 satisfy this condition. 

Next, we need to identify the 3-stars in the graph by checking each potential center node. 

For example:
- For node 0: (0, 8), (0, 9) represent two possible 3-stars.
- For node 9: (9, 0), (9, 3), (9, 6), (9, 7) represent four possible 3-stars.
- For node 2: (2, 3), (2, 5) represents one possible 3-star.
- For node 3: (3, 2), (3, 9) represent one possible 3-star.
- For node 8: (8, 0), (8, 4), (8, 7) represent three possible 3-stars.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (8, 9)>
<9, (0, 3)>
<9, (6, 7)>
<2, (3, 5)>
<3, (2, 9)>
<8, (0, 4, 7)>

Count of 3-stars: [6]
