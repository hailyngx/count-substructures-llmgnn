Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify nodes that have 3 edges connected to them. These nodes will be the centers of the 3-stars.
   - Nodes 0, 1, 4, 8 have 3 edges connected to them. 

Step 2: For each of these nodes, identify the nodes they are directly connected to. These connected nodes will form 3-stars with the central node.
   - From Node 0: (1, 4, 5)
   - From Node 1: (0, 2, 5)
   - From Node 4: (0, 7, 8)
   - From Node 8: (1, 4, 6)

Step 3: Count the number of unique 3-stars.
   - We have identified the following unique 3-stars:
     <0, (1, 4, 5)>
     <1, (0, 2, 5)>
     <4, (0, 7, 8)>
     <8, (1, 4, 6)>
     
   - Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
