Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's first identify all the 3-stars in the given graph:  
- Starting from node 0: (0, 2, 4), (0, 4, 7)  
- Starting from node 1: (1, 3, 7), (1, 5, 7)  
- Starting from node 2: (2, 0, 5), (2, 3, 5)  
- Starting from node 3: (3, 1, 8)  
- Starting from node 4: (4, 0, 7), (4, 6, 7)  
- Starting from node 5: (5, 1, 7), (5, 2, 6)  
- Starting from node 6: (6, 4, 5)  
- Starting from node 7: (7, 1, 5), (7, 4, 9)  
- Starting from node 8: (8, 3, 4)  
- Starting from node 9: (9, 5, 7), (9, 6, 7)  

Counting the unique 3-stars:  
<0, (2, 4, 7)>, <1, (3, 7, 5)>, <2, (0, 5, 3)>, <4, (0, 7, 6)>, <5, (1, 7, 2)>, <7, (1, 5, 4)>, <8, (3, 4, 8)>, <9, (5, 7, 6)>  

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
