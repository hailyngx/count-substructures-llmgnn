Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

Based on the definition of a 3-star graph, we need to find nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

The possible 3-stars in the graph are:
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<1, (0, 7, 9)>
<2, (0, 4, 5)>
<3, (0, 4, 5)>
<4, (2, 3, 8)>
<5, (2, 3, 8)>
<6, (5, 8)>
<7, (0, 1, 5)>
<8, (4, 5, 6)>
<9, (1, 4)>

Finally, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the given graph.
The total count is [(9)].
