Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star structures in the given graph. 

First, let's list all possible 3-stars using the unique nodes in the graph: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}.

<0, (1, 4, 7)>
<1, (0, 2, 4)>
<2, (1, 6, 9)>
<3, (4, 5, 9)>
<4, (1, 3, 6)>
<5, (3)>
<6, (2, 4, 9)>
<7, (1, 8, 9)>
<8, (7)>
<9, (1, 2, 3)>
 
Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars:
[9]
