Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify all nodes with exactly 3 incident edges. These nodes will be the centers of the 3-stars.  
    - Node 0 has 4 incident edges  
    - Node 1 has 4 incident edges  
    - Node 2 has 2 incident edges  
    - Node 3 has 3 incident edges  
    - Node 4 has 5 incident edges  
    - Node 5 has 4 incident edges  
    - Node 6 has 1 incident edge  
    - Node 7 has 3 incident edges  
    - Node 8 has 5 incident edges  
    - Node 9 has 5 incident edges  

Step 2: Examine nodes with 3 incident edges.  
- Node 7 and Node 9 have exactly 3 incident edges, making them potential centers of 3-stars.  

Step 3: For each potential center, identify the 3-stars.  
    1. For Node 7:  
        - Potential leaves: 0, 4  
        - Formed 3-star: <7, (0, 4)>
        
    2. For Node 9:  
        - Potential leaves: 0, 2, 3  
        - No 3-stars are formed with Node 9 as the center.  

Step 4: Count the number of 3-stars found.  
    - Number of 3-stars: 1
    
Therefore, the output is [1].  
The unique 3-star found is <7, (0, 4)>.
