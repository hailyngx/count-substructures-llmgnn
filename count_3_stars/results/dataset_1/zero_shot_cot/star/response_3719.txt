Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify nodes adjacent to node 0.  
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 8.  
- Among these connections, we have 3 options to form a 3-star graph with 0 as the center.  

Step 2: Identify nodes adjacent to node 1.  
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2 and 9.  
- Among these connections, we have 2 options to form a 3-star graph with 1 as the center.  

Step 3: Identify nodes adjacent to node 2.  
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 5, and 7.  
- Among these connections, we have 3 options to form a 3-star graph with 2 as the center.  

Step 4: Identify nodes adjacent to node 4.  
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2 and 6.  
- Among these connections, we have 2 options to form a 3-star graph with 4 as the center.  

Step 5: Identify nodes adjacent to node 5.  
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 7.  
- Among these connections, we have 3 options to form a 3-star graph with 5 as the center.  

Step 6: Identify nodes adjacent to node 6.  
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 7, 8, and 9.  
- Among these connections, we have 3 options to form a 3-star graph with 6 as the center.  

Step 7: Identify nodes adjacent to node 7.  
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 6, and 8.  
- Among these connections, we have 3 options to form a 3-star graph with 7 as the center.  

Step 8: Identify nodes adjacent to node 8.  
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 6, 7, and 9.  
- Among these connections, we have 3 options to form a 3-star graph with 8 as the center.

Step 9: Identify nodes adjacent to node 9.  
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 6, and 8.  
- Among these connections, we have 3 options to form a 3-star graph with 9 as the center.

Step 10: Total number of 3-stars in the given graph = Total options from step 1 to step 9. 
- (0) -> <0, (5, 6, 8)> : 3 options.
- (1) -> <1, (2, 9)> : 2 options.
- (2) -> <2, (1, 4, 5),  (2, 5, 7)> : 3 options.
- (4) -> <4, (2, 6)> : 2 options.
- (5) -> <5, (0, 2, 7)> : 3 options.
- (6) -> <6, (0, 4, 7), (6, 8, 9)> : 3 options.
- (7) -> <7, (2, 5, 8)> : 3 options.
- (8) -> <8, (0, 6, 7), (8, 9, 6)> : 3 options.
- (9) -> <9, (1, 6, 8)> : 3 options.

Total number of 3-stars in the graph: 
\[3 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 22\]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [22].
