Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's go step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is not a central node of any 3-star as it is connected to 3 nodes (5, 6, 7).

2. Node 1 is not a central node of any 3-star as it is connected to 5 nodes (2, 3, 5, 7, 8).

3. Node 2 forms a 3-star: <2, (1, 3, 5)> as it is connected to 3 nodes (1, 3, 5).

4. Node 3 is not a central node of any 3-star as it is connected to 3 nodes (1, 2, 5).

5. Node 4 is not a central node of any 3-star as it is connected to 2 nodes (5, 7).

6. Node 5 is not a central node of any 3-star as it is connected to 6 nodes (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6).

7. Node 6 is not a central node of any 3-star as it is connected to 3 nodes (0, 2, 5).

8. Node 7 is not a central node of any 3-star as it is connected to 4 nodes (0, 1, 4, 5).

9. Node 8 is not a central node of any 3-star as it is connected to only 2 nodes (1, 9).

10. Node 9 is not a central node of any 3-star as it is connected to 5 nodes (1, 2, 5, 6, 8).

Therefore, the unique 3-star found in the given graph is <2, (1, 3, 5)>.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1].
