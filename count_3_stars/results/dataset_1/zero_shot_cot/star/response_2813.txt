Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the possible combinations of a central node and three leaf nodes that form a 3-star.

Let's first identify the central nodes in the graph:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 6
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 8
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 7
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 5, 9
- Node 5 is connected to node 4
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 1
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 3, 8, 9
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 7
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 7

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:

1. 3-star with central node 0: 
    - <0, (4, 6, 8)>
    - <0, (4, 8, 9)>
    - <0, (4, 6, 9)>

2. 3-star with central node 2:
    - <2, (1, 3, 8)>

3. 3-star with central node 3:
    - <3, (2, 4, 7)>
    - <3, (4, 7, 9)>

4. 3-star with central node 4:
    - <4, (0, 3, 5)>
    - <4, (0, 5, 9)>

5. 3-star with central node 7:
    - <7, (3, 8, 9)>

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
