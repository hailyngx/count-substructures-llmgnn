Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify the central nodes and their adjacent nodes. 

Central Nodes:
- Node 0
- Node 1
- Node 4
- Node 6

3-stars:
<0, (1, 7, 8)>
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<4, (1, 2, 3)>
<6, (1, 4, 8)>

Now, we count the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph: [4].
