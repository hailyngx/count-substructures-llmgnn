Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<1, (0, 2, 7)>
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<3, (2, 4, 8)>
<4, (3, 6, 8)>
<5, (0, 9, 6)>
<6, (0, 4, 9)>
<7, (1, 8, 9)>
<8, (1, 3, 4)>
<9, (4, 5, 6)>

Now we count the number of unique 3-stars in the graph: [10].
