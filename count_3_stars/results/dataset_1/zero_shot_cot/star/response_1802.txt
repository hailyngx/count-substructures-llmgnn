Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each unique 3-star configuration.
Let's list all possible 3-stars:

<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<2, (3, 9, 5)>
<3, (1, 2, 6)>
<4, (1, 8, 6)>
<5, (6, 2, 9)>
<6, (3, 5, 8)>
<7, (3, 8, 9)>
<8, (4, 6, 9)>
<9, (2, 5, 7)>

There are [10] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
