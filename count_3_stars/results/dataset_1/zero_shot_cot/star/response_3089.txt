Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that are connected to node 0, as it will be the center node of the potential 3-stars. The nodes connected to node 0 are: 3, 4, 7, and 9. 

Now, we will check each of these nodes to see if they form 3-stars.
  
For node 3:
- <3, (0, 1, 5)>
- <3, (0, 5, 6)>
- <3, (0, 6, 9)>

For node 4:
- <4, (0, 5, 8)>

For node 7:
- <7, (0, 8, 9)>

For node 9:
- <9, (0, 2, 3)>
- <9, (0, 3, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
