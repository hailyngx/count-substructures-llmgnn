Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will first identify all the 3-stars and then count them. 

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. <0, (6, 7, 8)>
2. <1, (2, 7, 8)>
3. <2, (1, 8, 9)>
4. <3, (6, 9, *)>  (* represents any node connected to node 3)
5. <4, (5, 6, 8)>
6. <5, (4, 6, *)>  (* represents any node connected to node 5)
7. <6, (0, 3, 4)>
8. <7, (0, 2, 8)>
9. <8, (0, 1, 4)>
10. <9, (2, 3, *)>  (* represents any node connected to node 9)

Now let's count the total number of 3-stars in the given graph: [10].
