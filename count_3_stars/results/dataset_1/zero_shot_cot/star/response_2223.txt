Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes. Let's go step by step:

1. Identify nodes connected to exactly 3 other nodes:
   - Node 1: Connected to nodes 0, 7, and 8
   - Node 3: Connected to nodes 4, 7, and 8
   - Node 7: Connected to nodes 1, 3, and 5
   - Node 8: Connected to nodes 1, 3, and 8

2. List the unique 3-stars found:
   <1, (0, 7, 8)>
   <3, (4, 7, 8)>
   <7, (1, 3, 5)>
   <8, (1, 3, 8)>

3. Calculate the total number of 3-stars: [4]

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
