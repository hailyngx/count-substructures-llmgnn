Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Identify all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
   - Node 0 is connected to nodes 5, 7, and 7.
   - Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 7, and 7.
   - Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 7, and 7.
   - Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 4.

2. Count the number of unique 3-stars:
   - There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [4].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (5, 7, 7)>
<2, (4, 7, 7)>
<4, (2, 7, 7)>
<7, (0, 2, 4)>
