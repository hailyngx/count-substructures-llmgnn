Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will look for all instances where one node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Let's determine the 3-stars in the graph:
1. Node 0: (0, 2, 4), (0, 4, 6)
2. Node 1: (1, 4, 5)
3. Node 2: (2, 0, 4), (2, 4, 5), (2, 8, 9)
4. Node 3: (3, 5, 7)
5. Node 4: (4, 0, 2), (4, 1, 5), (4, 2, 5), (4, 6, 8), (4, 7, 8)
6. Node 5: (5, 1, 4), (5, 2, 3), (5, 4, 1), (5, 3, 7)
7. Node 6: (6, 0, 4), (6, 4, 8), (6, 8, 9)
8. Node 7: (7, 3, 5), (7, 4, 8)
9. Node 8: (8, 2, 4), (8, 1, 5), (8, 3, 7), (8, 4, 6)
10. Node 9: (9, 2, 6)

So, there are a total of [17] 3-stars in the given graph.
  
The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<1, (4, 5, 1)>
<2, (0, 4, 5)>
<2, (4, 5, 2)>
<2, (8, 9, 2)>
<3, (5, 7, 3)>
<4, (0, 2, 4)>
<4, (1, 5, 4)>
<4, (6, 8, 4)>
<4, (7, 8, 4)>
<5, (1, 4, 5)>
<5, (2, 3, 5)>
<6, (0, 4, 6)>
<6, (4, 8, 6)>
<6, (8, 9, 6)>
<7, (3, 5, 7)>
<7, (4, 8, 7)>
