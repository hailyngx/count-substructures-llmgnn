Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. (0, 4, 6)
2. (2, 5, 8)
3. (3, 5, 6)
4. (4, 0, 9)
5. (5, 2, 9)
6. (6, 0, 3)
7. (8, 2, 3)
8. (9, 4, 5)

Based on the identified 3-stars, we have a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph. 

Therefore, the final answer is [8].
