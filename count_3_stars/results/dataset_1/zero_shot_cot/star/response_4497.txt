Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that has exactly 3 edges connected to it, which would represent a center node connected to three leaves forming a 3-star. 
Nodes with 3 edges connected to them have the potential to be the center of a 3-star. Let's identify these nodes in the graph:
- Node 0 has 5 edges: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9)
- Node 3 has 4 edges: (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8)
- Node 5 has 4 edges: (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (1, 5)
- Node 6 has 4 edges: (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9)
- Node 9 has 4 edges: (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6)

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph. 

[The number of 3-stars is equal to the number of nodes that have exactly 3 edges connected to them.]

So, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [0, 3, 5, 6, 9].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (3, 4, 6)>
<3, (0, 4, 5)>
<5, (1, 3, 9)>
<6, (0, 2, 7)>
<9, (0, 1, 5)>

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
