Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star pattern where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

The central nodes in this graph are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

Let's consider each central node one by one:
1. For central node 0:
    - Nodes connected to 0: 3, 4, 5, 6, 9
    - Possible 3-star configurations: <0, (3, 4, 5)>, <0, (3, 4, 6)>, <0, (3, 5, 6)>, <0, (4, 5, 6)>
    
2. For central node 1:
    - Nodes connected to 1: 5, 8
    - No 3-star configuration possible with central node 1.

3. For central node 2:
    - Nodes connected to 2: 4, 6, 9
    - Possible 3-star configuration: <2, (4, 6, 9)>

4. For central node 3:
    - Nodes connected to 3: 0, 4, 5, 7
    - Possible 3-star configurations: <3, (0, 4, 5)>, <3, (4, 5, 7)>

5. For central node 4:
    - Nodes connected to 4: 0, 2, 3, 6, 7
    - Possible 3-star configurations: <4, (0, 3, 5)>, <4, (0, 3, 6)>, <4, (0, 5, 6)>, <4, (3, 5, 7)>, <4, (3, 6, 7)>

6. For central node 5:
    - Nodes connected to 5: 0, 1, 3, 7, 8
    - Possible 3-star configurations: <5, (0, 3, 7)>, <5, (0, 4, 7)>, <5, (1, 3, 8)>, <5, (3, 4, 7)>

7. For central node 6:
    - Nodes connected to 6: 0, 2, 4
    - Possible 3-star configuration: <6, (0, 4, 2)>

8. For central node 7:
    - Nodes connected to 7: 3, 4, 5, 9
    - Possible 3-star configurations: <7, (3, 4, 5)>, <7, (4, 5, 9)>

9. For central node 8:
    - Nodes connected to 8: 1, 5, 9
    - No 3-star configuration possible with central node 8.

10. For central node 9:
    - Nodes connected to 9: 0, 2, 7, 8
    - Possible 3-star configuration: <9, (0, 7, 8)>

Count of 3-stars in the given graph: [11]

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (3, 4, 5)>, <0, (3, 4, 6)>, <0, (3, 5, 6)>, <0, (4, 5, 6)>, <2, (4, 6, 9)>, <3, (0, 4, 5)>, <3, (4, 5, 7)>, <4, (0, 3, 5)>, <4, (0, 3, 6)>, <4, (0, 5, 6)>, <4, (3, 5, 7)>
