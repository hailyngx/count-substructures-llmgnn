Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (8, 2) (9, 2) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

The central node of each 3-star must have exactly 3 edges connected to it. We will list only the unique 3-stars:

<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<2, (0, 1, 8)>

Count of 3-stars: [2]
