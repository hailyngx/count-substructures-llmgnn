Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a 3-star pattern.

Let's list out the 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<1, (2, 3, 5)>
<2, (0, 1, 6)>
<4, (0, 6, 8)>
<5, (0, 1, -)>
<6, (2, 4, 7)>
<8, (2, 4, 6)>

Counting the unique 3-stars above, we find that there are [7] 3-stars in total.
