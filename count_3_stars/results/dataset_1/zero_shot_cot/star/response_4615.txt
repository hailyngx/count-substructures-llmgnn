Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the center nodes in the graph. The nodes with only three incident edges will serve as the central nodes for the 3-stars. These central nodes are 0, 1, and 8.

Now, we will find the 3-stars connected to each central node:
- For center node 0: (0, 5, 6, 7)
- For center node 1: (1, 2, 3, 8)
- For center node 8: (8, 1, 3, 5)

Counting the unique 3-stars, we have:
- <0, (5, 6, 7)>
- <1, (2, 3, 8)>
- <8, (1, 3, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
