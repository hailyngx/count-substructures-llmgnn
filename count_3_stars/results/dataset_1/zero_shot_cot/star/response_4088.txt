Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are part of at least one 3-star. 
We will exclude nodes with no connections (isolated nodes) since they cannot be part of a 3-star. 

Connected nodes: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 

Next, let's find the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, and count how many 3-stars they form. 
For each of these nodes, we will list the 3-star structures they are part of, starting with the central node and then the connected leaves. 

For node 0:
- <0, (6, 7, 8)>
[1]

For node 2:
- <2, (5, 8, 9)>
[1]

For node 5:
- <5, (2, 3, 4)>
- <5, (2, 4, 8)>
- <5, (3, 4, 8)>
[3]

For node 8:
- <8, (0, 2, 4)>
- <8, (0, 4, 5)>
- <8, (2, 4, 5)>
[3]

In total, there are [1 + 1 + 3 + 3] = [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
