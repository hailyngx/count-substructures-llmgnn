Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 2) (6, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will be the centers of the 3-stars. Then we find the neighbors of each center node to form the 3-stars.

The nodes connected to exactly three other nodes are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8.

Let's go through each potential center node and find their 3-stars:
1. Center node: 1
   - 3-star: <1, (0, 5, 9)>
   
2. Center node: 2
   - 3-star: <2, (1, 3, 6)>
   
3. Center node: 3
   - 3-star: <3, (2, 8, 9)>
   
4. Center node: 4
   - No 3-star since it's only connected to 2 other nodes.
   
5. Center node: 6
   - 3-star: <6, (2, 9, )>
   
6. Center node: 8
   - 3-star: <8, (3, 4, )>
   
Finally, counting the 3-stars found, we get a total of [4] 3-stars within the given graph. 

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found are <1, (0, 5, 9)>, <2, (1, 3, 6)>, <3, (2, 8, 9)>, <6, (2, 9, )>.
