Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
Let's first identify all the 3-stars present in the given graph:

<1, (2, 6, 7)>
<2, (1, 6, 8)>
<3, (7, 8, 9)>
<6, (1, 2, 8)>
<7, (0, 3, 6)>
<8, (2, 3, 6)>
<8, (3, 4, 6)>
<8, (4, 6, 8)>
<9, (3, 7, 8)>

Now, counting the number of unique 3-stars found, we have a total of [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
