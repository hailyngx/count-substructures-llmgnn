Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's go through each node to see if it is the center of a 3-star:

1. Node 0: (0, 2), (0, 8), (0, 9) - Node 0 is the center of the following 3-star: <0, (2, 8, 9)>

2. Node 1: (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 7) - Node 1 is the center of the following 3-star: <1, (2, 3, 5)>

3. Node 2: (2, 0), (2, 1) - Node 2 is not the center of any 3-star as it only has 2 connected nodes.

4. Node 3: (3, 1), (3, 4), (3, 5) - Node 3 is the center of the following 3-star: <3, (1, 4, 5)>

5. Node 4: (4, 3), (4, 7) - Node 4 is not the center of any 3-star as it only has 2 connected nodes.

6. Node 5: (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 9) - Node 5 is the center of the following 3-star: <5, (1, 3, 9)>

7. Node 6: (6, 7), (6, 9) - Node 6 is not the center of any 3-star as it only has 2 connected nodes.

8. Node 7: (7, 1), (7, 4), (7, 6), (7, 9) - Node 7 is the center of the following 3-star: <7, (1, 4, 6)>

9. Node 8: (8, 0) - Node 8 is not the center of any 3-star as it only has 1 connected node.

10. Node 9: (9, 0), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 7) - Node 9 is the center of the following 3-star: <9, (0, 5, 6)>

Therefore, the 3-stars identified in the given graph are: <0, (2, 8, 9)>, <1, (2, 3, 5)>, <3, (1, 4, 5)>, <5, (1, 3, 9)>, <7, (1, 4, 6)>, <9, (0, 5, 6)>.

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
