Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph, we need to identify all occurrences where one node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's go through the steps to find all the 3-star graphs:

1. Identify all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.
2. Verify that these nodes form a 3-star graph.
3. Count the number of unique 3-star graphs found.

Let's start with step 1. 

Nodes connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 7, and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 6, and 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 5, and 7.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 8, and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 5, 6, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, 5, and 8.

Now, let's verify if these connections form 3-star graphs:

<0, (2, 7, 9)>
<2, (0, 3, 5)>
<3, (1, 2, 9)>
<5, (1, 2, 8)>
<8, (1, 2, 5)>
<9, (0, 3, 4)>

Count of 3-star graphs: [6]

Thus, there are 6 unique 3-star graphs in the given graph.
