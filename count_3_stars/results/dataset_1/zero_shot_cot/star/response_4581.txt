Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:
1. Node 0: (1, 3, 4)
2. Node 1: (0, 2, 5), (0, 4, 6)
3. Node 2: (1, 7, 8), (2, 8, 9)
4. Node 3: (0, 5, 9)
5. Node 4: (0, 6, 7)
6. Node 5: (1, 3, 8)
7. Node 6: (1, 4, 8)
8. Node 7: (2, 4, 8)
9. Node 8: (2, 5, 6), (2, 4, 7)
10. Node 9: (2, 3, 9)

Therefore, there are a total of [9] 3-stars in the given graph. 
The unique 3-stars are <0, (1, 3, 4)>, <1, (0, 2, 5)>, <1, (0, 4, 6)>, <2, (1, 7, 8)>, <2, (2, 8, 9)>, <3, (0, 5, 9)>, <4, (0, 6, 7)>, <5, (1, 3, 8)>, <6, (1, 4, 8)>, <7, (2, 4, 8)>, <8, (2, 5, 6)>, <8, (2, 4, 7)>, <9, (2, 3, 9)>.
