Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are:
<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<3, (1, 5, 6)>
<4, (1, 5, 9)>
<5, (0, 1, 2)>
<6, (1, 3, 7)>
<7, (0, 6, 8)>
<8, (0, 7, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [9].
