Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the graph. Central nodes are those that have exactly three neighbors. 

The central nodes in the given graph are: 2, 3, 4, and 8.

Next, let's list out the 3-stars in the graph:

<2, (0, 3, 6)>
<3, (1, 2, 4)>
<4, (1, 2, 3)>
<8, (7, 9, -)>

Counting all the unique 3-stars, we get a total of [3].
