Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify the nodes which are connected to exactly three other nodes.

From the given edges, the nodes connected to exactly three other nodes are:
- Node 0 (connected to nodes 3, 5, 1)
- Node 1 (connected to nodes 3, 5, 0)
- Node 4 (connected to nodes 7, 9, 7)
- Node 6 (connected to nodes 5, 8, 8)

Step 2: Identify the 3-stars.

1. 3-star with center at node 0:
   <0, (3, 5, 1)>

2. 3-star with center at node 1:
   <1, (3, 5, 0)>

3. 3-star with center at node 4:
   <4, (7, 9, 7)>

4. 3-star with center at node 6:
   <6, (5, 8, 8)>

Step 3: Count the number of 3-stars in the graph.
