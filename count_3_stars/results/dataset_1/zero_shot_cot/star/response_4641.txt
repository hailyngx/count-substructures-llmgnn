Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 9) (7, 4) (7, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify all nodes with exactly 3 neighbors. These nodes could potentially be the center of a 3-star.
Nodes with 3 neighbors: Node 0, Node 1, Node 2, Node 4, Node 5, Node 7, Node 9

Step 2: For each potential center node, check if it forms a 3-star.
- For Node 0: (0, 1, 2), (0, 1, 4), (0, 2, 9), (0, 4, 7) [4 unique 3-stars]
- For Node 1: (1, 0, 5) [1 unique 3-star]
- For Node 2: (2, 0, 9) [1 unique 3-star]
- For Node 4: (4, 0, 7) [1 unique 3-star]
- For Node 5: (5, 1, 9) [1 unique 3-star]
- For Node 7: (7, 4, 9) [1 unique 3-star]
- For Node 9: (9, 2, 5) [1 unique 3-star]

Step 3: Calculate the total number of unique 3-stars
Total unique 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 10

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
Unique 3-stars: <0, (1, 2, 4)>, <0, (1, 0, 5)>, <0, (2, 0, 9)>, <0, (4, 0, 7)>, <1, (0, 5, 9)>, <2, (0, 9, 5)>, <4, (0, 7, 4)>, <5, (1, 9, 0)>, <7, (4, 9, 0)>, <9, (2, 5, 0)>
