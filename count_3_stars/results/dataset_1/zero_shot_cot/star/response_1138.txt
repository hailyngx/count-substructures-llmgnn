Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. From the given edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:

<0, (4, 5, 9)>
<1, (2, 4, 5)>
<2, (1, 3, 8)>
<4, (0, 1, 9)>
<5, (0, 1, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
