Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7. Since node 0 is connected to exactly three other nodes (1, 2, 3), it forms a 3-star: <0, (1, 2, 3)>.

2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 6, and 9. Since node 1 is connected to exactly three other nodes (0, 6, 9), it forms a 3-star: <1, (0, 6, 9)>.

3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 6. Since node 2 is connected to exactly three other nodes (0, 3, 6), it forms a 3-star: <2, (0, 3, 6)>.

4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 9. Since node 3 is connected to exactly three other nodes (0, 2, 9), it forms a 3-star: <3, (0, 2, 9)>.

5. Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, and 9. Since node 6 is connected to exactly three other nodes (1, 2, 9) and (0, 2, 6), it forms two 3-stars: <6, (1, 2, 9)> and <6, (0, 2, 6)>.

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars:

Total number of 3-stars: [5]
Unique 3-stars: <0, (1, 2, 3)>, <1, (0, 6, 9)>, <2, (0, 3, 6)>, <3, (0, 2, 9)>, <6, (1, 2, 9)>.
