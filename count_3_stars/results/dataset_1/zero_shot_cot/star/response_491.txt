Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes with exactly 3 edges, as these nodes are potential centers of 3-stars. They are nodes: 0, 1, 6, 7, 8, 9.

Now, let's list the 3-stars in the graph.
<0, (4, 5, 9)>
<1, (6, 9, 4)>
<6, (1, 4, 0)>
<7, (4, 8, 0)>
<8, (7, 4, 0)>
<9, (1, 5, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
