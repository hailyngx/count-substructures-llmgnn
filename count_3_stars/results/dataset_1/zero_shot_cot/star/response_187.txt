Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the given graph:
1. <1, (2, 4, 7)>
2. <2, (1, 4, 7)>
3. <3, (1, 4, 9)>
4. <4, (1, 2, 3)>
5. <5, (6, 9, -)>
6. <6, (3, 5, 8)>
7. <7, (1, 2, -)>
8. <8, (4, 6, -)>
9. <9, (3, 5, -)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
