Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that have exactly 3 edges connected to them. These nodes will be the centers of the 3-stars. 

In this graph, the nodes that have exactly 3 edges connected to them are nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, and 9. We will now identify the 3-stars in the graph with each of these nodes as the center.

Let's list them:
<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<1, (3, 4, 5)>
<2, (0, 5, 6)>
<6, (0, 5, 7)>
<9, (7, 8, 9)>

In this graph, there are 5 unique 3-stars. So, the final answer is [5].
