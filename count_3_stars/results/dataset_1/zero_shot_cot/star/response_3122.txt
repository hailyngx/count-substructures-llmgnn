Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars present.

Let's list all the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<2, (1, 3, 6)>
<3, (1, 2, 9)>
<4, (0, 6, 7)>
<5, (6, 7, 9)>
<6, (0, 1, 2)>
<7, (4, 6, 9)>
<8, (0, 7, 9)>
<9, (3, 5, 7)>

After identifying all the 3-stars, we count the total number of unique 3-stars we found:
