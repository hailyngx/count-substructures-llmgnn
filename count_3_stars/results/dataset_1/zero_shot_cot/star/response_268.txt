Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0: <0, (8, 9)>
2. Node 1: <1, (4, 5, 8)>
3. Node 2: <2, (6, 8)>
4. Node 3: <3, (6, 7)>
5. Node 4: <4, (1, 7, 8)>
6. Node 5: <5, (1)>
7. Node 6: <6, (2, 3, 7, 8, 9)>
8. Node 7: <7, (3, 4, 6)>
9. Node 8: <8, (0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 9)>
10. Node 9: <9, (0, 6, 8)>

There are 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
