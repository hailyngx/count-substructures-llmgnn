Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-star graphs in the given graph.

First, let's list all nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

Now, we will go through each node and find 3-stars with that node as the center:

Node 0:
- No 3-star can be formed with node 0.

Node 1:
- No 3-star can be formed with node 1.

Node 2:
- No 3-star can be formed with node 2.

Node 3:
- No 3-star can be formed with node 3.

Node 4:
- <4, 0, 1, 3>
- <4, 0, 3, 9>

Node 5:
- No 3-star can be formed with node 5.

Node 6:
- No 3-star can be formed with node 6.

Node 7:
- No 3-star can be formed with node 7.

Node 8:
- <8, 2, 5, 9>
- <8, 2, 6, 9>

Node 9:
- <9, 2, 3, 4>
- <9, 2, 8, 4>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5] and the unique 3-stars found are: 
<4, (0, 1, 3)>, 
<4, (0, 3, 9)>, 
<8, (2, 5, 9)>, 
<8, (2, 6, 9)>, 
<9, (2, 3, 4)>.
