Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's visualize the graph first.

```
    1 --- 8
    |     |
    9 --- 0
    |  /  |
    | /   |
    2 --- 6 -- 7
        / |
       4  5
```

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph.

1. <1, (0, 9, 8)>
2. <2, (9, 6, 4)>
3. <3, (4, 6, 5)>
4. <5, (0, 6, 7)>
5. <7, (6, 8, 5)>
6. <8, (1, 7, 9)>
7. <9, (0, 2, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
