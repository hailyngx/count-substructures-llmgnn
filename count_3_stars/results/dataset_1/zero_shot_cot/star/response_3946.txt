Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (2, 5, 6)>
<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<2, (0, 1, 9)>
<4, (1, 9, 0)>
<5, (0, 6, 7)>
<6, (0, 1, 5)>
<9, (2, 4, 0)>

Counting all the unique 3-stars, we find a total of [7] 3-stars in the given graph.
