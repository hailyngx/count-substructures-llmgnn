Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to each other:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 8
- Node 1: 0, 4, 9
- Node 2: 0, 4, 6, 9
- Node 3: 0, 7
- Node 4: 1, 2, 7, 8, 9
- Node 5: 7
- Node 6: 2, 7
- Node 7: 3, 4, 5, 6
- Node 8: 0, 4, 9
- Node 9: 1, 2, 4, 8

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:
- There are three nodes with exactly three neighbors: nodes 0, 2, and 4.
- Each node forms a 3-star with its neighbors. 

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<2, (0, 4, 6)>
<4, (1, 2, 8)>
