Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to each node:
- Node 0: 3, 9
- Node 2: 3, 6
- Node 3: 0, 2, 8
- Node 5: 9
- Node 6: 2
- Node 7: 8
- Node 8: 3, 7
- Node 9: 0, 5

Now, let's list the 3-stars in the graph:
- <0, (3, 9)>
- <2, (3, 6)>
- <3, (0, 2, 8)>
- <9, (0, 5)>
- (Final answer: [4])
