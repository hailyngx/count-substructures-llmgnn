Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that form 3-star structures.

Node 0: Connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 5, and 9.
Node 1: Connected to nodes 0, 3, and 8.
Node 2: Connected to nodes 0 and 9.
Node 3: Connected to nodes 0, 1, 6, 7, and 8.
Node 4: Connected to nodes 7 and 9.
Node 5: Connected to node 0.
Node 6: Connected to nodes 3 and 9.
Node 7: Connected to nodes 3 and 4.
Node 8: Connected to nodes 1, 3, and 9.
Node 9: Connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8.

Next, let's count the number of 3-star structures in the graph:
