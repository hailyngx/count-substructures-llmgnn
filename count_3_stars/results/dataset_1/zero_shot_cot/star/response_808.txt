Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's find all the 3-stars in the given graph.

We have the following nodes with their respective edges:
0: 3, 7, 8, 9
1: 2, 3, 8
2: 1, 3, 4
3: 0, 1, 2, 6, 8
4: 2
5: 7, 9
6: 3
7: 0, 5
8: 0, 1, 3
9: 0, 5

Now, we can list all the 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (3, 7, 8)>
<0, (3, 7, 9)>
<0, (3, 8, 9)>
<1, (2, 3, 8)>
<2, (1, 3, 4)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<3, (0, 1, 8)>
<3, (0, 2, 4)>
<3, (1, 2, 4)>
<5, (7, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
