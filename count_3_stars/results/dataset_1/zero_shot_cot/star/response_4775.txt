Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-star subgraphs in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where one node is connected to three other nodes. 

Looking at the given graph, we can see that nodes 0, 2, and 5 satisfy the conditions of being the center of a 3-star because each of them has exactly three edges connecting them to other nodes.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<2, (0, 5, 7)>
<5, (2, 6, 8)>
