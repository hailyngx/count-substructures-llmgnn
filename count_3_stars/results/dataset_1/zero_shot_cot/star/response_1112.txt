Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. We can do this by identifying all possible 3-stars in the graph.

Starting with the given information, let's list all the 3-stars in the graph:  
1. <0, (2, 2, 3)>
2. <1, (4, 6, 8)>
3. <2, (0, 3, 4)>
4. <4, (1, 2, 2)>
5. <6, (1, 3, 5)>
6. <8, (1, 6, 1)>

Since each 3-star is unique, the final answer is [6].
