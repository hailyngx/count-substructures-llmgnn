Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern.

First, let's write down the edges in a more readable format:

1: 7, 8
2: 3, 8, 9
3: 2, 9
4: 6, 7
5: 6
6: 4, 5, 8, 9
7: 1, 4, 8, 9
8: 1, 2, 6, 7
9: 2, 3, 6, 7

Now, we can start counting the 3-stars. 

Counting the number of 3-stars in the graph:
[4]

<1, (7, 8, 4)>
<2, (3, 8, 9)>
<6, (4, 5, 8)>
<6, (4, 8, 9)> 

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
