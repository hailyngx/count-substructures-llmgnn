Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all unique occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star-like pattern.

After examining the provided edges, we can find the following 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (2, 8, 0)>
<2, (0, 4, 7)>
<4, (2, 6, 8)>
<5, (1, 3, 6)>
<6, (4, 5, 6)>
<8, (0, 4, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
