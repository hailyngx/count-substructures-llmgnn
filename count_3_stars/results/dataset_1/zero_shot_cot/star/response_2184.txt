Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph step by step:

Step 1: Identify all nodes that are connected in a 3-star pattern.
- A node is connected in a 3-star pattern if it is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Step 2: List the unique 3-stars in the graph.
<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<1, (0, 2, 5)>
<2, (1, 3, 9)>
<3, (0, 2, 5)>
<4, (7, 8, 9)>
<5, (1, 3, 6)>
<7, (3, 4, 9)>
<9, (2, 7, 7)>

Step 3: Count the number of unique 3-stars.
There are 8 unique 3-stars in the given graph.
