Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the given graph:
1. Node 1: (1, 2, 6)
2. Node 2: (2, 1, 7)
3. Node 3: (3, 6, 9)
4. Node 6: (6, 1, 3)
5. Node 9: (9, 3, 6)

Counting the unique 3-stars, we find that there are [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
   
Therefore, the final answer is [5].
