Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph step by step:

1. Node 0:
    - Connected to nodes 2, 3, and 7
    - Forming a 3-star: <0, (2, 3, 7)>

2. Node 3:
    - Connected to nodes 0, 5, and 7
    - Forming a 3-star: <3, (0, 5, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: <<0, (2, 3, 7)>, <3, (0, 5, 7)>>.
