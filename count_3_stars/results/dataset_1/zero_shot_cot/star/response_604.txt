Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list all the 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (5, 8, 1)>
<2, (5, 6, 8)>
<4, (5, 2, 7)>
<6, (2, 7, 8)> 

There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph, leading to a total of [4] 3-stars.
