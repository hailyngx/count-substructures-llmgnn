Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. We can then list these 3-stars.

Given the provided edges, we can identify the 3-stars as follows:

1. <2, (3, 4, 8)>
2. <3, (2, 8, 9)>
3. <4, (2, 6, 8)>
4. <6, (1, 4, 9)>
5. <8, (2, 3, 4)>
6. <9, (3, 6, 7)>

Therefore, there are a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
