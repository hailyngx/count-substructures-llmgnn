Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 44 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the graph. Central nodes are the nodes connected to exactly three other nodes. 

The central nodes in this graph are:
- Node 0 (connected to nodes 5, 6, 7)
- Node 1 (connected to nodes 2, 3, 4)
- Node 4 (connected to nodes 1, 5, 7)
- Node 5 (connected to nodes 0, 4, 7)
- Node 7 (connected to nodes 0, 1, 4)
- Node 8 (connected to nodes 2, 4, 6)
- Node 9 (connected to nodes 0, 1, 3)

Next, we will construct 3-stars around these central nodes:

<0, (5, 6, 7)>
<1, (2, 3, 4)>
<4, (1, 5, 7)>
<5, (0, 4, 7)>
<7, (0, 1, 4)>
<8, (2, 4, 6)>
<9, (0, 1, 3)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
