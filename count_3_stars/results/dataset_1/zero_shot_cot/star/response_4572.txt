Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 7) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes in the graph based on the given edges:
Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Next, let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph.
To form a 3-star, we need a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Therefore, we will find all possible 3-stars in this graph.

Potential 3-stars:
<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<1, (0, 4, 7)>
<4, (1, 5, 8)>
<5, (0, 1, 4)>
<6, (0, 9, 7)>
<7, (1, 2, 8)>
<8, (0, 4, 7)>
<9, (0, 6, 10)>

Let's count the total number of unique 3-stars: [8]
