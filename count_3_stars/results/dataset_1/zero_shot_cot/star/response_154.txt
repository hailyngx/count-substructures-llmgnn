Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars present.

Given the edges provided, let's find the 3-stars:

1. Node 0:
    <0, (1, 2, 3)>
    <0, (1, 6, 9)>

2. Node 1:
    <1, (0, 2, 4)>
    <1, (0, 6, 8)>

3. Node 2:
    <2, (0, 1, 3)>
    <2, (0, 4, 6)>

4. Node 3:
    <3, (0, 2, 7)>

5. Node 4:
    <4, (1, 2, 6)>
    <4, (1, 8, 6)>

6. Node 6:
    <6, (0, 1, 2)>
    <6, (0, 4, 1)>

7. Node 7:
    <7, (3, 8,  0)>

8. Node 8:
    <8, (1, 4, 6)>
    <8, (1, 7, 9)>

9. Node 9:
    <9, (0, 8, 1)>

Now let's count the total number of unique 3-stars: [13].
