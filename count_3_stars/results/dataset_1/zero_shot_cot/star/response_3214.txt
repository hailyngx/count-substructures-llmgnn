Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step-by-step:

Nodes:
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Three-star configurations:
- Node 0: (3, 4, 5), (4, 3, 9), (5, 6, 9), (7, 2, 0)
- Node 2: (6, 5, 8)

Count:
There are 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph.
