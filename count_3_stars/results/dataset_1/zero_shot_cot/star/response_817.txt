Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star configuration. 

Let's start by listing all the 3-star configurations in the graph:

<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<0, (4, 5, 9)>
<3, (1, 2, 5)>
<3, (1, 5, 8)>

Since each 3-star is unique, we do not need to further analyze the graph. The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4]. 

So, the final answer is [4].
