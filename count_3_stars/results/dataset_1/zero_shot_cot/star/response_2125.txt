Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify the central nodes of all possible 3-stars.
    - A 3-star graph has a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.
    - To identify the central nodes, we look for nodes with exactly three incident edges. 

Central nodes: 0, 4, 6

Step 2: For each central node, identify the connected nodes to form 3-stars.
    - For each central node, we look at the nodes connected to it and form 3-stars.
    - A 3-star consists of the central node and three connected nodes.

3-stars with central node 0:
<0, (2, 8, 0)>

3-stars with central node 4:
<4, (1, 2, 6)>
<4, (6, 9, 4)>

3-stars with central node 6:
<6, (4, 7, 9)>

[The total number of 3-stars in the graph is: [4].
The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (2, 8, 0)>, <4, (1, 2, 6)>, <4, (6, 9, 4)>, <6, (4, 7, 9)>]
