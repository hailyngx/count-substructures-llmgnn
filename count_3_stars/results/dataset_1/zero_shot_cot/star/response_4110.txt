Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Below are the 3-stars found in the graph:

[<0, (2, 4, 6)>, <3, (2, 6, 7)>, <9, (4, 7, 8)>]

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
