Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first identify the nodes that are connected to other nodes by exactly 3 edges, indicating the presence of a 3-star.

Nodes with exactly three edges:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, 5 
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 6 
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 7

Next, we look for 3-stars in the graph:
- From node 0: 
  - <0, (1, 3, 4)> 
  - <0, (1, 3, 5)> 
  - <0, (1, 3, 6)>
  - <0, (1, 3, 9)>
  - <0, (3, 4, 6)> 
  - <0, (3, 4, 5)>
  - <0, (4, 5, 6)> 
  - <0, (4, 9, 3)> 

- From node 3: 
  - <3, (0, 2, 4)> 
  - <3, (0, 2, 5)> 

- From node 4:
  - <4, (0, 6, 3)>
  - <4, (0, 3, 5)> 
  
- From node 9:
  - <9, (0, 2, 7)>

Counting the unique 3-stars found, we have a total of [12] 3-stars in the given graph.
