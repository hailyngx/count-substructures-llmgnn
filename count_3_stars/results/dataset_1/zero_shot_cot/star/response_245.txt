Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's analyze the given graph to count the number of 3-stars. 

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (0, 4), (0, 7), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 8), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 7), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 9), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 7), (7, 0), (7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 4), (7, 6), (8, 2), (8, 9), (9, 5), (9, 8)

To form a 3-star, we need a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 1 can form a 3-star with nodes 3, 5, and 6. <1, (3, 5, 6)>
- Node 2 can form a 3-star with nodes 3, 5, and 6. <2, (3, 5, 6)>
- Node 4 can form a 3-star with nodes 0, 7, and 5. <4, (0, 7, 5)>
- Node 5 can form a 3-star with nodes 1, 9, and 2. <5, (1, 9, 2)>
- Node 6 can form a 3-star with nodes 1, 7, and 2. <6, (1, 7, 2)>
- Node 7 can form a 3-star with nodes 0, 4, and 6. <7, (0, 4, 6)>
  
Therefore, there are [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
