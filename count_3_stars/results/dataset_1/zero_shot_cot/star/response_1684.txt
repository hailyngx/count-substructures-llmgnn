Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify the nodes connected to each node
    - Node 0: 2, 3
    - Node 1: 4
    - Node 2: 0
    - Node 3: 0, 5
    - Node 4: 1, 5, 6
    - Node 5: 3, 4, 7, 9
    - Node 6: 4, 7, 8, 9
    - Node 7: 5, 6, 8, 9
    - Node 8: 6, 7, 9
    - Node 9: 5, 6, 7, 8

Step 2: Find all possible 3-stars in the graph 
    - 3-stars from node 0: <0, (2, 3, X)>
    - 3-stars from node 3: <3, (0, 5, X)>
    - 3-stars from node 4: <4, (1, 5, 6)>
    - 3-stars from node 5: <5, (3, 4, 7)>, <5, (3, 7, 9)>, <5, (4, 7, 9)>, <5, (7, 9, X)>
    - 3-stars from node 6: <6, (4, 7, 8)>, <6, (7, 8, 9)>
    - 3-stars from node 7: <7, (5, 6, 8)>, <7, (6, 8, 9)>
    - 3-stars from node 8: <8, (6, 7, 9)>
    - 3-stars from node 9: <9, (5, 6, 7)>

Step 3: Count the total number of unique 3-stars
    - Total number of unique 3-stars: 10

[Total number of 3-stars: [10]]
  
All unique 3-stars:
<0, (2, 3, X)>, <3, (0, 5, X)>, <4, (1, 5, 6)>, <5, (3, 4, 7)>, <5, (3, 7, 9)>, <5, (4, 7, 9)>, <5, (7, 9, X)>, <6, (4, 7, 8)>, <6, (7, 8, 9)>, <7, (5, 6, 8)>, <7, (6, 8, 9)>, <8, (6, 7, 9)>, <9, (5, 6, 7)>
