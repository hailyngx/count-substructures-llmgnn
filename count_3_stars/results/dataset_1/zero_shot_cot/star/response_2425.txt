Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the provided list of edges, we can see that nodes 1, 4, and 7 have degree 6, while the rest of the nodes have degree less than 6. This indicates that nodes 1, 4, and 7 are the potential central nodes of the 3-stars. 

Let's now identify the 3-stars in the graph:
1. Central Node: 1
   Leaves: 2, 4, 7
2. Central Node: 4
   Leaves: 1, 6, 7
3. Central Node: 7
   Leaves: 1, 2, 4

Counting the unique 3-stars we found, we have <> with nodes and leaves mentioned: 
<1, (2, 4, 7)>
<4, (1, 6, 7)>
<7, (1, 2, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
