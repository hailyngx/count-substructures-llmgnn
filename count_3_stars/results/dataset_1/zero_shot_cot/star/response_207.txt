Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify the nodes that form 3-stars.
In a 3-star graph, the center node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Hence, we need to identify nodes with three connections.

Nodes with 3 connections:
- Node 0 (connected to 2, 6, 6)
- Node 1 (connected to 5, 8, 5)
- Node 2 (connected to 0, 6, 6)
- Node 4 (connected to 5, 9, 5)
- Node 5 (connected to 1, 4, 1)
- Node 6 (connected to 0, 2, 3)
- Node 8 (connected to 1, 7, 7)
- Node 9 (connected to 3, 4, 3)

Step 2: Find the combinations that form 3-star structures.
We will look for combinations where a particular node is connected to three other nodes.

The 3-stars in this graph can be represented as follows:
<0, (2, 6, 6)>
<1, (5, 8, 5)>
<2, (0, 6, 6)>
<4, (5, 9, 5)>
<5, (1, 4, 1)>
<6, (0, 2, 3)>
<8, (1, 7, 7)>
<9, (3, 4, 3)>

Step 3: Count the number of unique 3-stars.
