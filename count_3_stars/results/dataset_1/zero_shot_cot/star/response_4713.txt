Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (3, 8, 0)>
<1, (2, 4, 1)>
<2, (1, 4, 9)>
<3, (0, 5, 7)>
<4, (2, 9, 1)>
<5, (3, 7, 6)>
<6, (2, 9, 5)>
<7, (3, 5, 8)>
<8, (0, 5, 7)>
<9, (2, 4, 6)>

Therefore, there are 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
The total number of 3-stars is [10].
