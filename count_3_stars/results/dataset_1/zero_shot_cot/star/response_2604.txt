Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<0, (4, 5, 7)>
<0, (4, 5, 9)>
<0, (4, 6, 7)>
<0, (4, 6, 9)>
<0, (4, 7, 9)>
<4, (0, 5, 7)>
<4, (0, 5, 9)>
<4, (0, 7, 9)>
<5, (0, 4, 8)>
<5, (0, 4, 9)>
<6, (0, 7, 8)>
<7, (0, 4, 6)>
<7, (0, 4, 9)>
<7, (0, 6, 8)>
<9, (0, 4, 7)>
<9, (0, 4, 5)>
<9, (0, 5, 8)>
<9, (0, 5, 4)>
<9, (0, 7, 8)>

Counting the unique 3-stars listed above, we find that there are [21] 3-stars in the given graph.
