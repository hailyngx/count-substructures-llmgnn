Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

The possible 3-stars in the graph can be formed around the nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, since these nodes have connectivity of at least 3.

Now, let's count the 3-stars around each of these nodes:

For node 0:
- <0, (1, 2, 3)>
- <0, (1, 7, 9)>
[2 3-stars]

For node 1:
- <1, (0, 2, 3)>
- <1, (0, 5, 9)>
[2 3-stars]

For node 2:
- <2, (0, 1, 8)>
[1 3-star]

For node 3:
- <3, (0, 1, 4)>
[1 3-star]

For node 4:
- <4, (3, 5, 7)>
[1 3-star]

For node 5:
- <5, (1, 4, 7)>
- <5, (0, 8, 9)>
[2 3-stars]

For node 7:
- <7, (0, 4, 5)>
[1 3-star]

For node 8:
- <8, (2, 5, 9)>
[1 3-star]

For node 9:
- <9, (0, 1, 5)>
- <9, (0, 5, 8)>
[2 3-stars]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12]. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<0, (1, 7, 9)>
<1, (0, 5, 9)>
<2, (0, 1, 8)>
<3, (0, 1, 4)>
<4, (3, 5, 7)>
<5, (1, 4, 7)>
<5, (0, 8, 9)>
<7, (0, 4, 5)>
<8, (2, 5, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 5)>
<9, (0, 5, 8)>
