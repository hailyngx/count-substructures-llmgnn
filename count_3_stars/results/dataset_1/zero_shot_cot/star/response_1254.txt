Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list all the 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<1, (0, 5, 9)>
<2, (0, 4, 6)>
<3, (0, 9, -)>
<4, (2, -, -)>
<5, (0, 1, -)>
<6, (2, 9, -)>
<9, (1, 2, 3)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we have a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
