Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, we need to identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars identified in the graph:
<0, (1, 2, 8)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<2, (0, 6, 9)>
<3, (1, 6, 8)>
<4, (1, 5, 7)>
<5, (4, 7, -)>
<6, (2, 3, -)>
<7, (5, 8, -)>
<8, (0, 3, 7)>
<9, (2, 3, -)>

Now, we count the total number of 3-stars in the graph:
