Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's start by identifying all possible 3-stars in the given graph:

The 3-stars in the given graph are:
<0, (8, 9, -)>
<1, (7, -,-)>
<2, (3, 4, -)>
<3, (2, 5, 6)>
<4, (2, 7, -)>
<5, (3, -,-)>
<6, (3, 7,-)>
<7, (1, 4, 6)>
<8, (0, 9,-)>
<9, (8, -,-)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph: [9]
