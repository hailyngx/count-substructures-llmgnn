Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central node and the leaf nodes for each potential 3-star in the graph.
Given the description of the graph:
- Node 2 has connections to nodes 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9.
- Node 5 has connections to nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, and 8.
- Node 7 has connections to nodes 2, 3, 8, and 9.
- Node 9 has connections to nodes 2, 4, 6, and 7.

Now, let's count the 3-stars in the graph:

1. (2, 4, 5)
2. (2, 5, 8)
3. (2, 7, 8)
4. (2, 8, 5)
5. (2, 9, 7)
6. (5, 2, 4)
7. (5, 2, 8)
8. (5, 4, 2)
9. (5, 8, 2)
10. (7, 2, 8)
11. (7, 8, 2)
12. (9, 2, 4)
13. (9, 2, 7)
14. (9, 4, 2)
15. (9, 7, 2)

Therefore, there are 15 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

Thus, the answer is [15]. 

Unique 3-stars: 
<1, (2, 4, 5)>
<1, (2, 5, 8)>
<1, (2, 7, 8)>
<1, (2, 8, 5)>
<1, (2, 9, 7)>
<1, (5, 2, 4)>
<1, (5, 2, 8)>
<1, (5, 4, 2)>
<1, (5, 8, 2)>
<1, (7, 2, 8)>
<1, (7, 8, 2)>
<1, (9, 2, 4)>
<1, (9, 2, 7)>
<1, (9, 4, 2)>
<1, (9, 7, 2)>
