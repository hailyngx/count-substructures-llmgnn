Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that are connected to each node. This will help us visualize the graph and find the 3-stars.

Node 0: 1, 4, 6, 8
Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 6
Node 2: 1, 4, 6, 7
Node 3: 1, 9
Node 4: 0, 2, 6
Node 5: 7
Node 6: 0, 1, 2, 4, 8
Node 7: 2, 5, 8
Node 8: 0, 6, 7
Node 9: 3

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph. 

[There are 3 unique 3-stars in this graph.] 

<0, (1, 6, 8)>
<1, (0, 2, 6)>
<2, (1, 4, 6)>
