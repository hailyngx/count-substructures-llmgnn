Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's start by finding all the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0:
   - <0, (4, 6, 9)>

2. Node 1:
   - <1, (2, 4, 5)>
   - <1, (4, 6, 7)>
   - <1, (4, 8, 5)>
   - <1, (4, 5, 6)>
   - <1, (6, 7, 1)>
   - <1, (8, 4, 1)>

3. Node 2:
   - <2, (1, 4, 8)>

4. Node 4:
   - <4, (0, 1, 5)>
   - <4, (1, 5, 6)>
   - <4, (5, 1, 4)>
   - <4, (6, 0, 4)>
   - <4, (8, 1, 4)>

5. Node 5:
   - <5, (1, 4, 6)>
   - <5, (4, 1, 5)>

6. Node 6:
   - <6, (0, 1, 4)>
   - <6, (1, 4, 5)>
   - <6, (4, 1, 6)>
   - <6, (7, 1, 6)>

7. Node 7:
   - <7, (1, 6, 1)>

8. Node 8:
   - <8, (1, 4, 9)>
   - <8, (2, 1, 8)>
   - <8, (4, 1, 8)>
   - <8, (9, 0, 8)>

9. Node 9:
   - <9, (0, 4, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [17].
