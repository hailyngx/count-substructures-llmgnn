Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify all possible combinations of 3-star patterns where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's identify the 3-stars:

<1, (3, 8, 9)>
<2, (7, 8, 9)>
<3, (1, 4, 7)>
<4, (0, 3, 7)>
<5, (8, 9, 5)>
<6, (7, 8, 6)>
<7, (2, 3, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
