Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's analyze each node:
- Node 0 is connected to 3 other nodes: 1, 2, and 8.
- Node 1 is connected to 2 other nodes: 0 and 6.
- Node 2 is connected to 4 other nodes: 0, 3, 4, and 8.
- Node 3 is connected to 3 other nodes: 2, 6, and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to 4 other nodes: 2, 6, 8, and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to 4 other nodes: 1, 3, 4, and 0.
- Node 8 is connected to 3 other nodes: 0, 2, and 4.
- Node 9 is connected to 2 other nodes: 3 and 4.

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (1, 2, 8)>
<2, (0, 3, 4)>
<3, (2, 6, 9)>
<4, (2, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
