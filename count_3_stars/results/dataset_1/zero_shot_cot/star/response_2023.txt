Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The central node in a 3-star graph is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify all the 3-stars in this graph:

1. Central Node: 0, Leaves: 1, 6, 8
2. Central Node: 1, Leaves: 0, 2, 8
3. Central Node: 2, Leaves: 1, 4, 5
4. Central Node: 2, Leaves: 1, 7, 9
5. Central Node: 4, Leaves: 2, 3, 8
6. Central Node: 6, Leaves: 0, 7, 8
7. Central Node: 7, Leaves: 2, 3, 9
8. Central Node: 8, Leaves: 0, 4, 6
9. Central Node: 9, Leaves: 2, 6, 7

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9], and they are <0, (1, 6, 8)>, <1, (0, 2, 8)>, <2, (1, 4, 5)>, <2, (1, 7, 9)>, <4, (2, 3, 8)>, <6, (0, 7, 8)>, <7, (2, 3, 9)>, <8, (0, 4, 6)>, <9, (2, 6, 7)>.
