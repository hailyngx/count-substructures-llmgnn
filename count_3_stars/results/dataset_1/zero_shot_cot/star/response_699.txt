Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 

First, let's list the nodes and their degrees:
- Node 0: degree 1
- Node 2: degree 2
- Node 3: degree 1
- Node 4: degree 2
- Node 5: degree 2
- Node 6: degree 2
- Node 7: degree 1
- Node 8: degree 1
- Node 9: degree 6

Since a 3-star graph consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can verify the 3-stars by looking at the nodes with degree 1 and the nodes they are connected to. 

In this graph, nodes 0, 3, 7, and 8 are the nodes with degree 1, and their connections are as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to node 9
- Node 3 is connected to node 9
- Node 7 is connected to node 4
- Node 8 is connected to node 2

So, the possible 3-stars in this graph are:
<0, (3, 5, 9)>
<3, (0, 9, 4)>
<7, (4, 9, 5)>
<8, (2, 6, 5)>

Therefore, there are [4] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
