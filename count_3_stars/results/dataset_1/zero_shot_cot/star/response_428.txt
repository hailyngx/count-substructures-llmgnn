Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in this graph step-by-step:

From the given information, the center nodes in the graph are nodes: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9.

1. For center node 0:
    - (0, 2, 3)
    - (0, 2, 5)
    - (0, 3, 5)
    <0, (2, 3, 5)>

2. For center node 2:
    - (2, 0, 3)
    - (2, 0, 5)
    - (2, 3, 9)
    - (2, 4, 6)
    - (2, 4, 9)
    - (2, 6, 8)
    - (2, 9, 3)
    - (2, 9, 4)
    <2, (0, 3, 5)>, <2, (4, 6, 9)>

3. For center node 3:
    - (3, 0, 2)
    - (3, 2, 9)
    <3, (0, 2, 9)>

4. For center node 4:
    - (4, 2, 9)
    - (4, 8, 5)
    - (4, 8, 6)
    - (4, 8, 9)
    - (4, 9, 2)
    <4, (2, 8, 9)>

5. For center node 5:
    - (5, 0, 2)
    - (5, 0, 1)
    - (5, 0, 8)
    - (5, 1, 8)
    - (5, 8, 4)
    <5, (0, 1, 8)>

6. For center node 6:
    - (6, 2, 8)
    - (6, 8, 4)
    <6, (2, 8, 4)>

7. For center node 8:
    - (8, 4, 6)
    - (8, 4, 9)
    - (8, 5, 0)
    - (8, 5, 1)
    - (8, 5, 6)
    - (8, 5, 9)
    - (8, 6, 2)
    - (8, 9, 4)
    <8, (4, 5, 6)>, <8, (5, 6, 9)>

8. For center node 9:
    - (9, 2, 3)
    - (9, 2, 4)
    - (9, 3, 0)
    - (9, 3, 2)
    - (9, 4, 8)
    - (9, 8, 4)
    <9, (2, 3, 4)>, <9, (3, 4, 8)>

Count of 3-stars: [13]
Unique 3-stars:
<0, (2, 3, 5)>, <2, (0, 3, 5)>, <2, (4, 6, 9)>, <3, (0, 2, 9)>, <4, (2, 8, 9)>, <5, (0, 1, 8)>, <6, (2, 8, 4)>, <8, (4, 5, 6)>, <8, (5, 6, 9)>, <9, (2, 3, 4)>, <9, (3, 4, 8)>
