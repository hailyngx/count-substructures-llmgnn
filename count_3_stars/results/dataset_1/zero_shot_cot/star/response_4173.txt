Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Start by finding all nodes that are directly connected to other nodes. These nodes will be potential centers of 3-stars.
   - Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 6, and 8.
   - Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 7, and 8.
   - Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 5, and 9.
   - Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 8, and 9.
   - Node 4 is connected to node 3.
   - Node 5 is connected to nodes 1 and 2.
   - Node 6 is connected to nodes 0 and 9.
   - Node 7 is connected to node 1.
   - Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, and 9.
   - Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 6, and 8.

2. Next, we can construct the 3-stars by considering each potential center node and its three connected nodes. 
   - For center node 0: (0, 2, 8), (0, 6, 9), (0, 8, 1)
   - For center node 1: (1, 3, 8), (1, 5, 2)
   - For center node 2: (2, 0, 6)
   - For center node 3: (3, 1, 5)
   - For center node 8: (8, 9, 6)

3. List out the unique 3-stars <...>:
   - <0, (2, 8, 1)>
   - <0, (6, 9, 8)>
   - <1, (3, 8, 1)>
   - <1, (5, 2, 3)>
   - <2, (0, 6, 9)>
   - <8, (9, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
