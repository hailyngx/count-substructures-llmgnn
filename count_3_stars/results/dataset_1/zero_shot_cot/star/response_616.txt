Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 7) (2, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Nodes connected to node 0: (0, 6), (0, 9)
   - <0, (6, 9)>

2. Nodes connected to node 1: (1, 4), (1, 6), (1, 8), (4, 1), (8, 1)
   - <1, (4, 6, 8)>

3. Nodes connected to node 2: (2, 7), (2, 9), (7, 2), (9, 2)
   - <2, (7, 9)>

4. Nodes connected to node 4: (4, 1), (4, 6), (4, 9), (1, 4)
   - <4, (1, 6, 9)>

5. Nodes connected to node 5: (5, 7), (5, 8), (7, 5), (8, 5)
   - <5, (7, 8)>

6. Nodes connected to node 6: (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 4), (6, 7), (7, 6)
   - <6, (0, 1, 4, 7)>

7. Nodes connected to node 7: (7, 2), (7, 5), (7, 6), (2, 7), (5, 7), (6, 7)
   - <7, (2, 5, 6)>

8. Nodes connected to node 8: (8, 1), (8, 5), (1, 8), (5, 8)
   - <8, (1, 5)>

9. Nodes connected to node 9: (9, 0), (9, 2), (9, 4), (0, 9)
   - <9, (0, 2, 4)>

Count of 3-stars in the graph: [9]
