Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible combinations where one node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Given the edges provided, we can identify the 3-stars as follows:

- <0, (8, 9, 1)> 
- <1, (2, 3, 8)>
- <8, (0, 1, 5)>
- <5, (4, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
