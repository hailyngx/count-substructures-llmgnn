Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) 

Response:
Given graph with 10 nodes and 20 edges:
Edges: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0)

Let's find the 3-stars in this graph.

<0, (5, 9)>
<1, (2, 3, 6)>
<2, (1, 5, X)>
<3, (1, 5, X)>
<4, (5, X, X)>
<5, (0, 2, 3)>
<6, (1, 8, X)>
<7, (8, X, X)>
<8, (6, 7, X)>
<9, (0, X, X)>

Total number of 3-stars: [9]
