Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern. 

Let's go through the nodes and determine the 3-stars:

1. Node 0: (0, 1, 3) - <0, (1, 3, 7)>
2. Node 1: (1, 0, 3) - <1, (0, 3, 5)>
3. Node 3: (3, 0, 1) - <3, (0, 1, 5)>, <3, (1, 0, 8)>, <3, (0, 3, 8)>, <3, (3, 8, 9)>, <3, (8, 9, 5)>, <3, (9, 4, 5)>
4. Node 5: (5, 1, 3) - <5, (1, 3, 2)>, <5, (3, 1, 0)> 
5. Node 6: (6, 1, 4) - <6, (1, 4, 7)>
6. Node 9: (9, 3, 4) - <9, (3, 4, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [10]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 3, 7)>, <1, (0, 3, 5)>, <3, (0, 1, 5)>, <3, (1, 0, 8)>, <3, (0, 1, 5)>, <3, (0, 3, 8)>, <3, (3, 8, 9)>, <3, (8, 9, 5)>, <3, (9, 4, 5)>, <5, (1, 3, 2)>, <5, (3, 1, 0)>, <6, (1, 4, 7)>, <9, (3, 4, 5)>
