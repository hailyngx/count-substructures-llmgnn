Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that form 3-stars in the given graph. 

Node 0: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 7), (0, 8)  
Node 1: (1, 0), (1, 4), (1, 7)  
Node 2: (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 8), (2, 9)  
Node 3: (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 8), (3, 9)  
Node 4: (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 6), (4, 8)  
Node 5: (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 6)  
Node 6: (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 7), (6, 8)  
Node 7: (7, 0), (7, 1), (7, 6), (7, 8)  
Node 8: (8, 0), (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 6), (8, 7)  
Node 9: (9, 2), (9, 3)  

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (1, 7, 8)>  
<1, (0, 4, 7)>  
<2, (3, 5, 8)>  
<3, (2, 4, 5)>  
<4, (1, 3, 8)>  
<5, (2, 3, 6)>  
<6, (4, 5, 7)>  
<7, (0, 1, 6)>  
<8, (0, 2, 4)>  

Counting the number of 3-stars gives us a total of [9].
