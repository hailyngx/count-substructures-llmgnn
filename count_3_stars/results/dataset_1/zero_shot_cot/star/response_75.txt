Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's list down all the 3-stars in the given graph:
<0, (1, 3, 7)>
<1, (0, 6, 7)>
<2, (4, 8, 9)>
<3, (0, 4, 9)>
<4, (2, 3, 8)>
<7, (0, 1, -)>
<8, (2, 4, -)>
<9, (2, 3, -)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in this graph.
