Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we need to identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 
To find a 3-star, we look for nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them. 
Let's go through the nodes and identify the 3-stars: 

1. Node 0 has 2 edges connected: (0, 2) and (0, 4).
2. Node 1 has 2 edges connected: (1, 4) and (1, 5).
3. Node 2 has 3 edges connected: (2, 0), (2, 3), and (2, 8). 
   This forms a 3-star with the center node 2 and leaves 0, 3, and 8: <2, (0, 3, 8)>.
4. Node 3 has 3 edges connected: (3, 2), (3, 6), and (3, 9).
   This forms a 3-star with the center node 3 and leaves 2, 6, and 9: <3, (2, 6, 9)>.
5. Node 4 has 2 edges connected: (4, 0) and (4, 1).
6. Node 5 has 1 edge connected: (5, 1).
7. Node 6 has 2 edges connected: (6, 3) and (6, 7).
8. Node 7 has 1 edge connected: (7, 6).
9. Node 8 has 2 edges connected: (8, 2) and (8, 9).
10. Node 9 has 2 edges connected: (9, 3) and (9, 8).

Now, we have identified two 3-stars: <2, (0, 3, 8)> and <3, (2, 6, 9)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
