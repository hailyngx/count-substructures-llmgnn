Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to each node:
- Node 0: 1, 7
- Node 1: 0, 3, 4, 6, 8
- Node 3: 1, 7
- Node 4: 1, 6
- Node 5: 9
- Node 6: 1, 4, 7, 9
- Node 7: 0, 3, 6
- Node 8: 1
- Node 9: 5, 6

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 1 can form three 3-stars: <1, (0, 8, 6)>, <1, (3, 4, 6)>, <1, (6, 4, 8)>
- Node 6 can form one 3-star: <6, (1, 4, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4]. 
The unique 3-stars found are <1, (0, 8, 6)>, <1, (3, 4, 6)>, <1, (6, 4, 8)>, <6, (1, 4, 9)>.
