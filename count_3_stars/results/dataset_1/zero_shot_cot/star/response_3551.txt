Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
Firstly, we need to identify the central node in each 3-star. In this case, the central node will be any node that is connected to three other nodes, as per the definition of a 3-star graph.

Let's list down the unique 3-stars in the graph provided:

<1, (3, 4, 6)>
<6, (1, 2, 5)>
<8, (3, 5, 9)>
