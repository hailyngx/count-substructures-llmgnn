Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify nodes with three or more edges connected to them.  
   - Node 1 has 4 edges
   - Node 4 has 4 edges
   - Node 5 has 5 edges
   - Node 6 has 4 edges
   - Node 8 has 3 edges

Step 2: Identify potential 3-stars by considering nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them.
    - Node 8 forms a 3-star <8, (4, 7, 9)>

Step 3: Count the number of unique 3-stars found.
    - There is 1 unique 3-star.

Therefore, the final answer is [1].
