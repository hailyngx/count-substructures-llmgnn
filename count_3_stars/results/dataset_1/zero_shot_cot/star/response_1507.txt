Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 

The 3-stars in the graph are:
<0, (5, 8, 9)>
<1, (6, 9, -)>
<2, (4, 6, 9)>
<3, (6, 8, 9)>
<4, (2, 8, 9)>
<6, (1, 2, 3)>
<8, (0, 3, 4)>
<9, (0, 1, 2)>
<5, (-, 0, 7)>
<7, (-, 5, 8)>

Now, count the total number of unique 3-stars: [9].
