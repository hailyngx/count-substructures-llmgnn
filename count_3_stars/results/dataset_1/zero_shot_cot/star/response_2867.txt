Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify the unique 3-star configurations: 

1. <0, (2, 6, 9)>
2. <2, (0, 9, 3)>
3. <3, (4, 6, 7)>
4. <4, (3)>
5. <5, (7)>
6. <6, (0, 3)>
7. <7, (3, 5, 8)>
8. <8, (7, 9)>
9. <9, (2, 3, 7)>
  
Counting the number of unique 3-stars: [9]
