Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (1, 8, 9)>
<1, (0, 7, 9)>
<4, (2, 3, 9)>
<6, (8, 9, 0)>
<9, (1, 4, 6)>
