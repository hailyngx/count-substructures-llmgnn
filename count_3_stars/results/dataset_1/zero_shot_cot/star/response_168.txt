Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (5, 7, 8)>
  
<1, (3, 4, 7)>
   
<2, (6, 5, 9)>

<3, (1, 4, 9)>

<4, (3, 7, 9)>

<5, (0, 2, 9)>

<6, (2, 7, 8)>
  
<7, (0, 4, 6)>

<8, (0, 6, 7)>

<9, (3, 5, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
