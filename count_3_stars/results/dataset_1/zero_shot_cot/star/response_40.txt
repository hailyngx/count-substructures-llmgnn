Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 4, and 5: <1, (2, 4, 5)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 4, and 7: <3, (1, 4, 7)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, and 6: <4, (1, 3, 6)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, and 4: <6, (0, 1, 4)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 3, and 6: <7, (0, 3, 6)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 6, and 9: <9, (4, 6, 9)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we find there are [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
