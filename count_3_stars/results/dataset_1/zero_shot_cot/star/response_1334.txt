Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star present.

Here are the unique 3-stars identified in the graph:
<0, (1, 2, 9)>
<1, (0, 8, 9)>
<2, (0, 3, 9)>
<3, (2, 4, 7)>
<4, (3, 6, 9)>
<5, (7, 8)>
<6, (4, 9)>
<7, (3, 5, 8)>
<8, (1, 5, 7)>
<9, (0, 4, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
