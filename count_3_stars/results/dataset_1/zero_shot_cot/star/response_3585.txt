Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node of each 3-star and the nodes connected to it. Since a 3-star graph has a center node connected to exactly three other nodes, we will look for nodes that satisfy this condition.

Given the edges provided, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 0:
    <0, (4, 7, 8)>
2. Node 3:
    <3, (6, 8, -)>
3. Node 4:
    <4, (0, 9, -)>
4. Node 8:
    <8, (0, 3, 9)>
5. Node 9:
    <9, (4, 8, -)>

Count of 3-stars: [5]
