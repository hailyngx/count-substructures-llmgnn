Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

- Node 0: (0, 5), (0, 6) --> 0 is not part of a 3-star.
- Node 1: (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 4), (1, 7) --> <1, (3, 4, 6)>, <1, (3, 4, 7)>, <1, (4, 6, 7)>
- Node 2: (2, 3) --> 2 is not part of a 3-star.
- **Node 3: (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 7), (3, 1), (3, 4), (3, 7) --> <3, (1, 2, 4)>, <3, (1, 4, 7)>, <3, (2, 4, 7)>
- Node 4: (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 9), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 9) --> <4, (1, 3, 7)>, <4, (3, 7, 8)>, <4, (3, 7, 9)>
- Node 5: (5, 0), (5, 8) --> 5 is not part of a 3-star.
- Node 6: (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 8) --> 6 is not part of a 3-star.
- Node 7: (7, 1), (7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 9), (7, 1), (7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 9) --> <7, (1, 3, 4)>, <7, (3, 4, 9)>
- **Node 8: (8, 4), (8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 9), (8, 4), (8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 9) --> <8, (4, 5, 6)>, <8, (4, 5, 9)>, <8, (5, 6, 9)>
- Node 9: (9, 4), (9, 7), (9, 8) --> 9 is not part of a 3-star.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found are <1, (3, 4, 6)>, <1, (3, 4, 7)>, <1, (4, 6, 7)>, <3, (1, 2, 4)>, <3, (1, 4, 7)>, <3, (2, 4, 7)>, <4, (1, 3, 7)>, <4, (3, 7, 8)>, <4, (3, 7, 9)>, <7, (1, 3, 4)>, <7, (3, 4, 9)>, <8, (4, 5, 6)>, <8, (4, 5, 9)>, and <8, (5, 6, 9)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is **14**.
