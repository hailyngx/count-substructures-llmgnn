Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the number of 3-stars in the given graph. Since a 3-star has a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we need to find all possible 3-stars in the graph. 

Let's enumerate the 3-stars found in the graph based on the given edges:

1. <0, (1, 7, 9)>
2. <1, (0, 3, 4)>
3. <2, (1, 3, 8)>
4. <3, (1, 2, 7)>
5. <4, (1, 2, 8)>
6. <5, (4, 8, 9)>
7. <7, (0, 1, 3)>
8. <8, (1, 2, 4)>
9. <9, (0, 7, 8)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph.
