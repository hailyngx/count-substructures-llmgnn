Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's go through each node as the potential center of a 3-star:
1. For node 0: <0, (1, 2, 8)>
2. For node 1: <1, (0, 9, 8)>
3. For node 2: <2, (0, 3, 6)>
4. For node 3: <3, (2, 8,   )> (There is no 3rd node connected to 3)
5. For node 4: <4, (7,   ,   )> (There are not enough nodes connected to 4)
6. For node 5: <5, (6, 8,   )>
7. For node 6: <6, (2, 5, 9)>
8. For node 7: <7, (4, 6,   )> (There is no 3rd node connected to 7)
9. For node 8: <8, (0, 3, 5)>
10. For node 9: <9, (1, 6,   )> (There is no 3rd node connected to 9)

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found are: <0, (1, 2, 8)>, <1, (0, 9, 8)>, <2, (0, 3, 6)>, <5, (6, 8, )>, and <6, (2, 5, 9)>.

As a result, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
