Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Node 0 has 6 edges (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9), which forms 3-stars with the nodes connected to it.
   <0, (2, 4, 7)>
   <0, (3, 4, 9)>
   <0, (8, 7, 9)>
   Total 3-stars from node 0: 3

2. Node 1 has 2 edges (1, 2) (1, 8), which is not connected to exactly three other nodes.

3. Node 2 has 5 edges (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9), which forms 3-stars with the nodes connected to it.
   <2, (0, 1, 8)>
   <2, (4, 8, 9)>
   Total 3-stars from node 2: 2

4. Node 3 and Node 9 have 1 edge each, which is not enough to form a 3-star.

5. Node 4 has 4 edges (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8), which forms 3-stars with the nodes connected to it.
   <4, (0, 2, 5)>
   <4, (8, 2, 5)>
   Total 3-stars from node 4: 2

6. Node 5 has 2 edges (5, 4) (5, 8), which is not connected to exactly three other nodes.

7. Nodes 7 and 8 have 2 edges each, which is not enough to form a 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7]. [3 + 2 + 2]
