Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star-like configuration.

Let's go step-by-step to identify the 3-stars:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 6, 8, and 9.
   But the connections (0, 1), (0, 4), and (0, 6) form a 3-star with node 0 as the central node.
   <0, (1, 4, 6)>
   
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, 7, and 8.
   But the connections (1, 0), (1, 4), and (1, 8) form another 3-star with node 1 as the central node.
   <1, (0, 4, 8)>
   
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 7. 
   However, there are no 3-stars with node 2 as the central node in this graph.
   
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 5.
   The connections (3, 1), (3, 4), and (3, 5) form a 3-star with node 3 as the central node.
   <3, (1, 4, 5)>
   
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 7.
   There are already two 3-stars identified with node 0 and node 1 as central nodes.
   
6. Node 5 is connected to node 3 only.
   There are no 3-stars with node 5 as the central node in this graph.
   
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 8.
   The connections (6, 0), (6, 2), and (6, 8) form a 3-star with node 6 as the central node.
   <6, (0, 2, 8)>
   
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 4.
   There are no 3-stars with node 7 as the central node in this graph.
   
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 6.
   There are already two 3-stars identified with node 0 and node 1 as central nodes.
   
10. Node 9 is connected to node 0 only.
   There are no 3-stars with node 9 as the central node in this graph.

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3]. The unique 3-stars found are <0, (1, 4, 6)>, <1, (0, 4, 8)>, and <6, (0, 2, 8)>.
