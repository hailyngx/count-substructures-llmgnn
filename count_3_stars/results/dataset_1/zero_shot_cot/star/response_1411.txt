Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will form the center of the 3-star.

Nodes connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 4 (connected to nodes 0, 6, and 7)
- Node 8 (connected to nodes 3, 4, and 5)
- Node 9 (connected to nodes 0, 1, and 3)
  
Step 2: For each of these nodes, list the neighbors and form the unique 3-stars.

- For node 4: <4, (0, 6, 7)>
- For node 8: <8, (3, 4, 5)>
- For node 9: <9, (0, 1, 3)>

Step 3: Count the total number of unique 3-stars. 
- Total number of 3-stars = 3
