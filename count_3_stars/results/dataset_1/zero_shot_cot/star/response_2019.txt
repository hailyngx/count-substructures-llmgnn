Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify nodes with three connections (i.e., nodes with degree 3).
- Node 0 and Node 9 have a degree of 3.

Step 2: For each node, identify the edges connecting it to other nodes.
- For Node 0: (0, 2), (0, 8), (0, 9)
- For Node 9: (9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 5)

Step 3: Count the number of 3-stars by examining the connections of the identified nodes.
- For Node 0: <0, (2, 8, 9)>
- For Node 9: <9, (0, 1, 5)>

[Total number of 3-stars: 2]  
   
Therefore, the final answer is [2].
