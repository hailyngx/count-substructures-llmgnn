Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star-like pattern.

Based on the given edges, the 3-star structures in the graph are as follows:
<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<1, (0, 4, 6)>
<3, (1, 6, 7)>
<4, (0, 1, 9)>
<6, (0, 1, 3)>
<7, (3, 6, 9)>
<9, (2, 4, 6)>

Count of 3-stars: [7]
