Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will first identify all the 3-stars by looking for nodes connected to exactly three other nodes (forming a star shape) and then count the total number of such 3-stars. 

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<1, (3, 6, 8)>
<2, (0, 3, 5)>
<3, (1, 2, 4)>
<4, (0, 3, 6)>
<7, (4, 9, )>
<9, (4, 7, 8)>

Count of 3-stars: [7]
