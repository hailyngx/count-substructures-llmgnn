Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars which consist of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's go through the nodes and their connections to identify the 3-stars:

1. Node 0: No 3-star centered at node 0 since it has only 2 connections.
2. Node 1: <1, (2, 5, 8)>
3. Node 2: <2, (0, 1, 9)>
4. Node 3: No 3-star centered at node 3 since it has only 2 connections.
5. Node 4: <4, (2, 8, 9)>
6. Node 5: No 3-star centered at node 5 since it has only 1 connection.
7. Node 6: No 3-star centered at node 6 since it has only 2 connections.
8. Node 7: No 3-star centered at node 7 since it has only 1 connection.
9. Node 8: <8, (1, 2, 4)>
10. Node 9: <9, (0, 2, 3)>

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are:

<1, (2, 5, 8)>
<2, (0, 1, 9)>
<4, (2, 8, 9)>
<8, (1, 2, 4)>
<9, (0, 2, 3)>

Count of 3-stars: [5]
