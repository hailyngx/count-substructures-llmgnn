Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the possible 3-stars by finding nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them. 

Based on the given edges, let's find all the 3-stars:
- <1, (6, 9, 7)>
- <2, (0, 6, 7)>
- <3, (4, 8, 8)>
- <4, (3, 5, 9)>
- <5, (6, 4, 0)>
- <6, (1, 2, 5)>
- <7, (2, 8, 9)>
- <8, (3, 7, 9)>
- <9, (1, 7, 8)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we find a total of [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
