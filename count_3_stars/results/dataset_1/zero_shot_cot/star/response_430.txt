Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The center node of a 3-star must have exactly three edges connected to it. Let's go through each node one by one to find the 3-stars:

1. Node 0: It does not have 3 edges connected to it.
2. Node 1: It has 4 edges connected to it: (1, 3), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8). So, it cannot be the center of a 3-star.
3. Node 2: It has 2 edges connected to it and cannot be the center of a 3-star.
4. Node 3: It has 3 edges connected to it: (3, 1), (3, 6), (3, 9). Possible 3-star: <3, (1, 6, 9)>.
5. Node 4: It has 1 edge connected to it and cannot be the center of a 3-star.
6. Node 5: It has 1 edge connected to it and cannot be the center of a 3-star.
7. Node 6: It has 6 edges connected to it: (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 5), (6, 8), (6, 9). Possible 3-stars: <6, (1, 2, 3)>, <6, (1, 5, 8)>, <6, (2, 3, 8)>, <6, (3, 1, 9)>.
8. Node 7: It has 1 edge connected to it and cannot be the center of a 3-star.
9. Node 8: It has 3 edges connected to it: (8, 1), (8, 4), (8, 6). Possible 3-star: <8, (1, 4, 6)>.
10. Node 9: It has 2 edges connected to it and cannot be the center of a 3-star.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are:
<3, (1, 6, 9)>, <6, (1, 2, 3)>, <6, (1, 5, 8)>, <6, (2, 3, 8)>, <6, (3, 1, 9)>, <8, (1, 4, 6)>.
