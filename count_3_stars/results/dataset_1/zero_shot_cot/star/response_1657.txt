Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 0) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Given the edges provided in the graph, let's first identify all the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Central node: 0
   Leaves: 4, 5, 6, 7, 9

2. Central node: 1
   Leaves: 2, 5, 8

3. Central node: 2
   Leaves: 1, 5

4. Central node: 3
   Leaves: 4, 6

5. Central node: 4
   Leaves: 0, 3

6. Central node: 5
   Leaves: 0, 1, 2, 9

7. Central node: 6
   Leaves: 0, 3

8. Central node: 7
   Leaves: 0

9. Central node: 8
   Leaves: 1

10. Central node: 9
    Leaves: 0, 5

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:

<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<1, (2, 5, 8)>
<2, (1, 5)>
<3, (4, 6)>
<4, (0, 3)>
<5, (0, 1, 2)>
<6, (0, 3)>
<7, (0)>
<8, (1)>
<9, (0, 5)>

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
