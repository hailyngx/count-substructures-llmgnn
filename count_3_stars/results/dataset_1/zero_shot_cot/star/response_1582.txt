Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes connected to each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 4, 5, 9
- Node 1: 0, 2, 4, 7, 8
- Node 2: 0, 1, 4, 9
- Node 4: 0, 1, 2, 5, 7, 9
- Node 5: 0, 4, 6, 8
- Node 6: 5
- Node 7: 1, 4
- Node 8: 1, 5
- Node 9: 0, 2, 4

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:

1. From the above analysis, we can see that nodes 0, 1, 2 each form one 3-star with nodes connected to them. Thus, <0, (1, 2, 4)>, <1, (0, 2, 4)>, and <2, (0, 1, 4)> are the 3-stars formed by these central nodes.

2. Nodes 4 and 5 can form multiple 3-stars:
   - <4, (0, 1, 2)>
   - <4, (0, 1, 5)>
   - <4, (0, 2, 5)>
   - <4, (1, 2, 5)>
   - <5, (0, 4, 6)>
   - <5, (1, 4, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
