Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify all nodes connected to node 0.
    - Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, and 5.
Step 2: Determine if the nodes connected to node 0 form 3-stars.
    - Only nodes 2, 4, and 5 are connected to node 0, forming a 3-star with node 0 as the center: <0, (2, 4, 5)>
Step 3: Repeat steps 1 and 2 for all nodes in the graph.
    - Node 1 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 6, and 7.
    - Nodes 4, 5, and 9 are connected to node 4, forming a 3-star with node 4 as the center: <4, (1, 5, 9)>
    - Node 6 is connected to node 1, forming a 3-star with node 1 as the center: <1, (6, 8)>
    - Nodes 2 and 7 are connected to node 7, forming a 3-star with node 7 as the center: <7, (1, 2, 3)>
    - Nodes 3 and 7 are connected to node 3, forming a 3-star with node 3 as the center: <3, (0, 4, 7)>
Step 4: Count the total number of 3-stars identified.
    - There are 4 unique 3-stars found.
Output the final answer inside brackets: [4]
List the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<4, (1, 5, 9)>
<1, (6, 8)>
<7, (1, 2, 3)>
