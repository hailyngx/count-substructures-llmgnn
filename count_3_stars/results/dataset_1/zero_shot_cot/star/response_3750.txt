Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 8) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the cases where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list down the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (2, 7, 1)>
<1, (2, 4, 8)>
<2, (0, 1, 4)>
<4, (1, 2, 8)>
<7, (0, 2, 3)>
<8, (1, 5, 6)>
<9, (7, -)>  # This 3-star is incomplete as there is only one leaf node

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
