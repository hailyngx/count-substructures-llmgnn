Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes in the graph based on the given edges. 
The nodes in the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}.

Next, let's determine the neighbors of each node based on the edges provided:
- Node 0 is connected to Node 2.
- Node 1 is connected to Nodes 2, 7, and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to Nodes 0, 1, 5, 7, and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to Node 4 and 7.
- Node 4 is connected to Nodes 3, 6, and 8.
- Node 5 is connected to Nodes 2, 6, and 8.
- Node 6 is connected to Nodes 4, 5.
- Node 7 is connected to Nodes 1, 2, 3.
- Node 8 is connected to Nodes 4, 5.
- Node 9 is connected to Nodes 1, 2.

Now, let's count the number of 3-star configurations in the graph. 
To do this, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

The 3-star configurations in the graph are:
<2, (0, 1, 5)>
<2, (1, 5, 9)>
<4, (3, 6, 8)>
<4, (6, 3, 8)>
<5, (2, 6, 8)>
<8, (4, 5, 6)>
<9, (1, 2, 7)>
<9, (2, 1, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
