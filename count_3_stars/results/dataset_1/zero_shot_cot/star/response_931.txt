Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list all the 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<1, (0, 2, 5)>
<2, (0, 1, 5)>
<5, (0, 1, 2)>

Now we can count the total number of 3-stars: [4].
