Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

From the given edges, we can see that the nodes with their respective neighbors (adjacent nodes) are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 7
- Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 5, 8
- Node 2: 0, 1, 5, 7
- Node 3: 0, 1, 4, 6
- Node 4: 3, 6, 7, 9
- Node 5: 1, 2, 9
- Node 6: 3, 4
- Node 7: 0, 2, 4, 9
- Node 8: 1
- Node 9: 4, 5, 7

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
- From the above connections, we see that there are no 3-stars in the given graph. 

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [0].
