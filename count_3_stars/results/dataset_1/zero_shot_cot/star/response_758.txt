Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
Let's first list down all possible 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <1, (3, 4, 8)>
2. <1, (3, 4, 9)>
3. <3, (1, 7, 9)>
4. <4, (1, 5, 7)>
5. <8, (1, 6, -)>
6. <9, (1, 3, 4)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars [6].
