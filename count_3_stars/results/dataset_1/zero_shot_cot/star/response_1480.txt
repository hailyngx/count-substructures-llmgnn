Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's identify the 3-stars and then count them.

The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 6, 8, 9
- Node 1: 2, 3, 9
- Node 2: 1, 5, 7, 8
- Node 3: 1, 6
- Node 4: 6
- Node 5: 2, 6, 7, 9
- Node 6: 0, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8
- Node 7: 2, 5, 6, 9
- Node 8: 0, 2, 6
- Node 9: 0, 1, 5, 7

There are multiple 3-stars in this graph. Let's identify them:
1. <0, (6, 8, 9)>
2. <1, (2, 3, 9)>
3. <2, (1, 5, 7)>
4. <5, (2, 6, 7)>
5. <6, (0, 3, 4)>
6. <7, (2, 5, 9)>
7. <9, (1, 5, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
