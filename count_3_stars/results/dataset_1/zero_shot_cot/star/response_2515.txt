Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central nodes and their corresponding leaves. 

Looking at the edges provided, we can determine the following 3-stars:

<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<1, (0, 4, 6)>
<4, (1, 6, 7)>
<6, (1, 4, 5)>
<9, (1, 3, 7)>

Counting the unique 3-stars we found above, we get a total of [5].
