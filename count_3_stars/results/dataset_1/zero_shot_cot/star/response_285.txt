Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's first identify the central nodes in the graph. The center must have degree 3 in order to form a 3-star. From the given edges, we can see that nodes 0, 1, and 4 are the only nodes with degree 3. 

Let's now define the 3-stars in the graph:
1. <0, (1, 4, 5)>
2. <1, (0, 3, 7)>
3. <4, (0, 6, 9)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
