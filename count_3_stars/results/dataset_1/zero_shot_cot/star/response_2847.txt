Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's start by listing the 3-stars we find in the graph:

<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<1, (4, 7, 9)>
<2, (0, 3, -)>
<3, (0, 2, 8)>
<4, (0, 1, 9)>
<6, (7, 8, 9)>
<7, (0, 1, 6)>
<8, (1, 3, 6)>
<9, (1, 3, 4)>

Counting these unique 3-stars, we have a total of [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
