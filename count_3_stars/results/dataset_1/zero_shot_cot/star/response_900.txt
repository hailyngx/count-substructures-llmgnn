Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
Given the information, let's start by identifying the nodes which form 3-stars in the graph. Since a 3-star has a center connected to exactly three other nodes, we need to find nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them.

1. Node 0: Connected to nodes 2, 4, 5, and 7. (4 edges)
2. Node 1: Connected to nodes 5, 7, and 8. (3 edges)
3. Node 2: Connected to nodes 0, 7, and 8. (3 edges)
4. Node 3: Connected to nodes 5, 8, and 9. (3 edges)
5. Node 4: Connected to nodes 0 and 9. (2 edges)
6. Node 5: Connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, and 8. (4 edges)
7. Node 7: Connected to nodes 0, 1, and 2. (3 edges)
8. Node 8: Connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, and 5. (4 edges)
9. Node 9: Connected to nodes 3 and 4. (2 edges)

Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 7 have exactly 3 edges connected to them and can serve as the center of a 3-star.

Now, let's determine the 3-stars in the graph:
- For Node 1: <1, (5, 7, 8)>
- For Node 2: <2, (0, 7, 8)>
- For Node 3: <3, (5, 8, 9)>
- For Node 7: <7, (0, 1, 2)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
