Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern. 

Let's go through the nodes and identify the 3-star patterns:

1. Node 0: (0, 1, 2), (0, 6, 7)
2. Node 1: (1, 0, 2), (1, 5, 9)
3. Node 2: (2, 0, 1), (2, 6, 8)
4. Node 6: (6, 0, 8), (6, 9, 7)
5. Node 7: (7, 0, 4), (7, 5, 9)
6. Node 8: (8, 2, 6), (8, 6, 9)
7. Node 9: (9, 1, 6), (9, 7, 8)

There are a total of 7 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

Therefore, the answer is: [7]

List of unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 2, 6)>
<1, (0, 2, 5)>
<2, (0, 1, 8)>
<6, (0, 8, 9)>
<7, (0, 4, 5)>
<8, (2, 6, 9)>
<9, (1, 6, 7)>
