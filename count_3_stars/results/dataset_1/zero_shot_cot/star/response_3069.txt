Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:
   
   Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9

   [Total 3-stars: 5]

   <0, (7, 2, 9)>
   <1, (4, 9, 2)>
   <2, (3, 5, 7)>
   <3, (2, 8, 9)>
   <9, (1, 5, 8)>
