Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

1. Node 0: (0, 3, 5), (0, 3, 6)
2. Node 1: (1, 3, 7)
3. Node 2: (2, 4, 7)
4. Node 3: (3, 0, 1), (3, 2, 4), (3, 4, 8), (3, 5, 7), (3, 8, 9)
5. Node 4: (4, 2, 7), (4, 3, 7), (4, 3, 8)
6. Node 5: (5, 0, 7), (5, 7, 9)
7. Node 6: (6, 0, 8)
8. Node 7: (7, 1, 2), (7, 3, 5), (7, 4, 8), (7, 5, 9), (7, 8, 0)
9. Node 8: (8, 0, 3), (8, 2, 4), (8, 3, 4), (8, 4, 7), (8, 7, 9)
10. Node 9: (9, 1, 3), (9, 3, 5), (9, 5, 7), (9, 8, 0)

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [19].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 5, 6)>, <1, (3, 7)>, <2, (4, 7)>, <3, (0, 1)>, <3, (2, 4)>, <3, (4, 8)>, <3, (5, 7)>, <3, (8, 9)>, <4, (2, 7)>, <4, (3, 7)>, <4, (3, 8)>, <5, (0, 7)>, <5, (7, 9)>, <6, (0, 8)>, <7, (1, 2)>, <7, (3, 5)>, <7, (4, 8)>, <7, (5, 9)>, <7, (8, 0)>, <8, (0, 3)>, <8, (2, 4)>, <8, (3, 4)>, <8, (4, 7)>, <8, (7, 9)>, <9, (1, 3)>, <9, (3, 5)>, <9, (5, 7)>, <9, (8, 0)>
