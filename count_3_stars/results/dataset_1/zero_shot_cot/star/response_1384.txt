Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that are connected to node 0 since the center of a 3-star should have exactly three edges.

Node 0 is connected to nodes 3 and 9. Since it needs exactly three connections, node 0 cannot form a 3-star.

Now, let's look for other potential centers for 3-stars:

1. Node 1 is connected to 2, 4, and 5. So, a 3-star can be formed with center node 1 and leaves 2, 4, and 5. <1, (2, 4, 5)>

2. Node 2 is connected to 1, 7, and 8. So, a 3-star can be formed with center node 2 and leaves 1, 7, and 8. <2, (1, 7, 8)>

3. Node 3 is connected to 0, 4, and 9. So, a 3-star can be formed with center node 3 and leaves 0, 4, and 9. <3, (0, 4, 9)>

4. Node 4 is connected to 1, 3, and 5. So, a 3-star can be formed with center node 4 and leaves 1, 3, and 5. <4, (1, 3, 5)>

5. Node 5 is connected to 1 and 7. Since it has only two connections, node 5 cannot form a 3-star.

6. Node 6 is connected to 7 and 8. Since it has only two connections, node 6 cannot form a 3-star.

7. Node 7 is connected to 2, 5, 6, and 9. Since it has four connections, node 7 cannot be the center of a 3-star.

8. Node 8 is connected to 2 and 6. Since it has only two connections, node 8 cannot form a 3-star.

9. Node 9 is connected to 0, 3, and 7. So, a 3-star can be formed with center node 9 and leaves 0, 3, and 7. <9, (0, 3, 7)>

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are: <1, (2, 4, 5)>, <2, (1, 7, 8)>, <3, (0, 4, 9)>, and <9, (0, 3, 7)>.
The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
