Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's analyze the graph to find all the 3-stars present in it. Since a 3-star has a central node connected to exactly three leaf nodes, we will look for nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them. 

After analyzing the given graph, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<1, (0, 2, 5)>
<2, (1, 3, 4)>
<4, (0, 2, 6)>
<5, (1, 6, 7)>
<6, (0, 4, 5)>
<7, (0, 5, 8)>
<8, (0, 2, 7)>

So, the total number of unique 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
