Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the possible instances where a single node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Given the edges provided, we have the following 3-stars:
1. <0, (1, 5, 7)>
2. <1, (0, 6, 7)>
3. <2, (6, 9, 9)>
4. <3, (5, 6, 6)>
5. <4, (7, 9, 9)>
6. <5, (0, 3, 9)>
7. <6, (1, 2, 3)>
8. <7, (0, 1, 4)>
9. <8, (9, 9, 9)>
10. <9, (2, 4, 5)>
11. <9, (4, 5, 6)>
12. <9, (5, 6, 9)>
13. <9, (6, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [13].
