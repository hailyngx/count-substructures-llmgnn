Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<1, (0, 5, 7)>
<2, (5, 3, 9)>
<3, (4, 5, 8)>
<3, (5, 1, 4)>
<3, (5, 2, 3)>
<3, (5, 3, 4)>
<4, (3, 4, 5)>
<6, (3, 6, 9)>
<6, (6, 3, 7)>
<7, (1, 5, 7)>

Counting all the unique 3-stars listed above, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
