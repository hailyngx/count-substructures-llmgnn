Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's first identify the central nodes in the graph. Since a 3-star graph has one central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we need to identify the nodes that have three edges connected to them.

Based on the given edges, the central nodes are 0, 1, and 8. 

Now let's identify the 3-star graphs:
- For central node 0: <0, (1, 2, 4)>
- For central node 1: <1, (0, 2, 5)> and <1, (2, 5, 8)>
- For central node 8: <8, (1, 2, 5)> and <8, (2, 5, 6)>

Therefore, there are a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
