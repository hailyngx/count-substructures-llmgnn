Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible 3-stars. 

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
1. <1, (2, 4, 5)>
2. <2, (1, 7, 9)>
3. <3, (5, 7, 9)>
4. <4, (1, 8, 0)>
5. <5, (0, 3, 1)>
6. <6, (1, 7, 0)>
7. <7, (1, 2, 3)>
8. <8, (0, 1, 4)>
9. <9, (2, 3, 1)>

There are 9 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
