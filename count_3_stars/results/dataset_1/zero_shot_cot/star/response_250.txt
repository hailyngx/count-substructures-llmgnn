Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars in the given graph. 
A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

From the given edges, we can list out the nodes that are connected to each node:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 7, and 9
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 5, and 9
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 8 and 9
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 5, 7, 8, and 9
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, 6, 7, and 9
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 5, 7, and 9
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 5, and 6
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 3 and 4
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6

Now, let's list out the 3-stars present in the graph:

<0, (1, 5, 7)>  
<0, (1, 5, 9)>  
<0, (1, 7, 9)>  
<0, (5, 7, 9)>  
<1, (0, 5, 9)>  
<4, (5, 7, 9)>  
<5, (0, 1, 4)>  
<5, (0, 4, 7)>  
<5, (0, 4, 9)>  
<5, (1, 4, 9)>  
<5, (4, 6, 7)>  
<5, (4, 6, 9)>  
<5, (5, 7, 9)>  
<5, (6, 7, 9)>  
<7, (0, 4, 5)>  
<7, (0, 4, 6)>  
<7, (4, 5, 6)>  
<9, (0, 1, 5)>  
<9, (0, 4, 5)>  
<9, (0, 4, 6)>  
<9, (1, 4, 5)>  
<9, (1, 4, 9)>  
<9, (3, 4, 5)>  
<9, (3, 4, 6)>  
<9, (4, 5, 6)>  

Counting all the unique 3-stars, we get a total of [25].
