Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes connected to each node:

- Node 0: 2, 3, 9
- Node 1: 2, 9
- Node 2: 0, 1, 5, 8
- Node 3: 0
- Node 5: 2, 8
- Node 8: 2, 5
- Node 9: 0, 1

Now, let's look for the 3-stars:

- 3-star centered at node 0: (0, 2, 3), (0, 3, 9), (0, 9, 2)
- 3-star centered at node 1: (1, 2, 9)
- 3-star centered at node 2: (2, 0, 1), (2, 0, 5), (2, 0, 8)
- 3-star centered at node 5: (5, 2, 8)
- 3-star centered at node 8: (8, 2, 5)
- 3-star centered at node 9: (9, 0, 1)

Counting all unique 3-stars, we have: 
<0, (2, 3, 9)>, <0, (2, 0, 1)>, <0, (2, 0, 5)>, <0, (2, 0, 8)>, <1, (2, 9)>, <5, (2, 8)>, <8, (2, 5)>, <9, (0, 1)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
