Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 6) (3, 1) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

<0, (4, 6, -)>
<1, (3, 5, 8)>
<2, (6, -, -)>
<3, (1, -, -)>
<4, (0, -, -)>
<5, (1, 6, 8)>
<6, (0, 2, 5)>
<7, (9, -, -)>
<8, (1, 5, 6)>
<9, (7, -, -)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
