Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, we need to identify the nodes with three edges, which will be our central nodes for the 3-stars. In this case, the nodes with three edges are nodes 2, 4, 6, 7, and 9.

Let's find the 3-stars for each of the central nodes:

For node 2:
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 6, and 7.
- There are no 3-stars with node 2 as the center because it does not have exactly three leaves.

For node 4:
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2 and 9.
- There is one 3-star with node 4 as the center: <4, (2, 9, 6)>.

For node 6:
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 2 and 9.
- There is one 3-star with node 6 as the center: <6, (2, 9, 7)>.

For node 7:
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2 and 9.
- There is one 3-star with node 7 as the center: <7, (2, 9, 6)>.

For node 9:
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 6, and 7.
- There are no 3-stars with node 9 as the center because it does not have exactly three leaves.

Now, we can calculate the total number of 3-stars by adding the 3-stars for each central node:

Total number of 3-stars: [3]

Unique 3-stars:
<4, (2, 9, 6)>
<6, (2, 9, 7)>
<7, (2, 9, 6)>
