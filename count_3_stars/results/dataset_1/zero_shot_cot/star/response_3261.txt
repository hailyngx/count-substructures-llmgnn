Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, which consist of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we need to look for nodes that have three edges connected to them. 

Looking at the given edges, we can identify the 3-stars:

1. Node 1: (1, 0), (1, 3), (1, 9)  <1, (0, 3, 9)>
2. Node 4: (4, 0), (4, 9), (4, 9)  <4, (0, 9, 9)>
3. Node 7: (7, 3), (7, 5), (7, 6)  <7, (3, 5, 6)>
4. Node 9: (9, 1), (9, 4), (9, 5)  <9, (1, 4, 5)>

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
