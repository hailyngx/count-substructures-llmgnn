Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that are connected directly to node 1 as these can potentially form 3-stars with 1 as the center. 
Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 7, and 8.

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph using the information we have:

1. <1, (2, 7, 8)>
2. <2, (1, 3, 6)>
3. <3, (2, 5, 9)>
4. <5, (3, 9)>
5. <6, (2)>
6. <7, (1, 2)>
7. <8, (1, 2, 9)>
8. <9, (5, 8)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the given graph: 
[8]
