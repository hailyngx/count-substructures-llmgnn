Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we can look for each node that has exactly three edges connected to it, indicating a 3-star pattern. Let's identify the 3-stars:

1. Node 1 is a central node in the 3-star <1, (3, 5, 6)>.
2. Node 2 is a central node in the 3-star <2, (4, 7, 9)>.
3. Node 4 is a central node in the 3-star <4, (2, 5, 1)>.
4. Node 6 is a central node in the 3-star <6, (1, 7, 8)>.
5. Node 7 is a central node in the 3-star <7, (0, 2, 6)>.
6. Node 9 is a central node in the 3-star <9, (0, 2, 7)>.

Therefore, there are a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
