Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible 3-stars by looking at each node and determining if it could be the center of a 3-star. 

Let's go through each node one by one and see if they form a 3-star:

1. Node 0: Not a center of a 3-star
2. Node 1: Not a center of a 3-star
3. Node 2: Forms a 3-star with leaves 3, 6, 8 <2, (3, 6, 8)>
4. Node 3: Not a center of a 3-star
5. Node 4: Not a center of a 3-star
6. Node 5: Not a center of a 3-star
7. Node 6: Not a center of a 3-star
8. Node 8: Forms a 3-star with leaves 2, 6, 9 <8, (2, 6, 9)>
9. Node 9: Forms two 3-stars with leaves (0, 1, 4) <9, (0, 1, 4)> and (2, 5, 9) <9, (2, 5, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4], and they are <2, (3, 6, 8)>, <8, (2, 6, 9)>, <9, (0, 1, 4)>, <9, (2, 5, 9)>.
