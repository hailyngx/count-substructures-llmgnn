Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph based on the given edges.

Nodes with their adjacent nodes:
- 0: 2, 3, 4, 7
- 1: 2, 4, 9
- 2: 0, 1, 4, 5, 8
- 3: 0, 4, 5
- 4: 0, 1, 2, 3
- 5: 2, 3, 7
- 7: 0, 5
- 8: 2, 9
- 9: 1, 8

Now, we can count the number of 3-stars by checking each node for possible 3-star configurations.

The 3-stars in the graph are:
<0, (2, 4, 7)>
<1, (2, 4, 9)>
<2, (0, 1, 4)>
<3, (0, 4, 5)>
<4, (0, 1, 2)>
<5, (2, 3, 7)>
<7, (0, 5, 7)>
<8, (1, 2, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
