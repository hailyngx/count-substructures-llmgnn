Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-star configurations in the given graph. 

1. <0, (1, 3, 9)>
2. <1, (0, 9, 9)>
3. <2, (7, 9, 9)>
4. <3, (0, 5, 6)>
5. <4, (7, 9, 9)>
6. <5, (3, 6, 9)>
7. <6, (3, 5, 9)>
8. <7, (2, 4, 9)>
9. <8, (7, 9, 9)>
10. <9, (0, 1, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
