Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes can be potential centers of 3-stars.

From the given edges, we identify the following nodes with three connections:
- Node 1 (connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 8, and 9)
- Node 4 (connected to nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9)

Step 2: For each potential center node, check if they form a 3-star by verifying if the adjacent nodes of the center node are also connected to each other.

For Node 1:
- Nodes 0, 2, 3, 8, and 9 are connected to Node 1, but they are not mutually connected to each other.

For Node 4:
- Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9 are connected to Node 4. Among them, nodes 6, 7, and 9 are mutually connected (forming a 3-star with Node 4 as the center).
  
Step 3: Calculate the total number of 3-stars in the graph.

The total number of 3-stars is 1, as only one 3-star <4, (6, 7, 9)> is found.

Therefore, the final answer is [1].  
The unique 3-star found is <4, (6, 7, 9)>.
