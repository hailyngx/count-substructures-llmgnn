Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the nodes that are connected to a single central node. These nodes will form the leaves of the 3-star.

Based on the provided edges, the possible 3-stars in the graph are as follows:
<0, (8, 7, 1)>
<1, (2, 4, 5)>
<4, (1, 7, 7)>
<5, (1, 6, 6)>
<7, (4, 6, 8)>
<8, (0, 7, 7)>

Counting the unique 3-stars found above, we have a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
