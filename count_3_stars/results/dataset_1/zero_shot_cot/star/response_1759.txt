Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will identify all the unique instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Let's consider each node as the potential central node and check if it forms a 3-star.  

Starting with node 0:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 5 and 9. However, it doesn't have a 3rd connection, so it does not form a 3-star.

Moving on to node 1:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 6, and 8. This forms a 3-star: <1, (3, 6, 8)>.

For node 2:
- Node 2 is connected to node 9 but doesn't have two more connections, so it doesn't form a 3-star.

For node 3:
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1 and 4. However, it already forms a 3-star with node 1.

For node 4:
- Node 4 is connected to node 3 but doesn't have two more connections, so it doesn't form a 3-star.

For node 5:
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0 and 8. However, it already forms a 3-star with node 8.

For node 6:
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1 and 8. However, it already forms a 3-star with node 8.

For node 7:
- Node 7 is connected to node 8 but doesn't have two more connections, so it doesn't form a 3-star.

For node 8:
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 6, and 7. This forms two 3-stars: <8, (1, 5, 6)> and <8, (1, 6, 7)>.

For node 9:
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0 and 2 but doesn't have one more connection, so it doesn't form a 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].  

The unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (3, 6, 8)>
- <8, (1, 5, 6)>
- <8, (1, 6, 7)>
