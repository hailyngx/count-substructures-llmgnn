Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

First, let's list down the edges in a more readable format:
- 0: {1, 5, 8, 9}
- 1: {0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8}
- 2: {1, 6}
- 3: {1, 9}
- 4: {5, 7, 8}
- 5: {0, 1, 4, 7}
- 6: {1, 2}
- 7: {4, 5}
- 8: {0, 1, 4}
- 9: {0, 3}

Next, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<1, (0, 2, 8)>
<1, (0, 3, 9)>
<1, (2, 6, 1)>
<4, (5, 7, 8)>
<5, (0, 1, 4)>
<8, (0, 1, 4)>
  
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
