Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
We will now find the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Start by identifying nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.
2. Check if there is an edge between these nodes to confirm the presence of a 3-star.

The nodes connected to exactly three other nodes are: 1, 3, 5, 8.

### Nodes connected to node 1:
- Node 3 is connected to node 1. Check for a third connection:
    - Node 6 is connected to node 1. (3-star found: <1, (3, 6, 7)>)

### Nodes connected to node 3:
- Node 1 is connected to node 3. Check for a third connection:
    - Node 7 is connected to node 3. (3-star found: <3, (1, 7, 4)>)

### Nodes connected to node 5:
- Node 8 is connected to node 5. Check for a third connection:
    - No third connection found.

### Nodes connected to node 8:
- Node 5 is connected to node 8. Check for a third connection:
    - No third connection found.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].

### Unique 3-stars:
- <1, (3, 6, 7)>
- <3, (1, 7, 4)>
