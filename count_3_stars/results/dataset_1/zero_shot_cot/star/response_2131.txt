Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's go step by step to find all the 3-stars:

1. Node 0:
    - (0, 4) (0, 7)
    <0, (4, 7)>

2. Node 1:
    - (1, 5) (1, 6)
    <1, (5, 6)>

3. Node 2:
    - (2, 7) (2, 8)
    <2, (7, 8)>

4. Node 3:
    - (3, 5)
    <3, (5)>

5. Node 4:
    - (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8)
    <4, (0, 7, 8)>

6. Node 5:
    - (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9)
    <5, (1, 3, 9)>

7. Node 6:
    - (6, 1) (6, 9)
    <6, (1, 9)>

8. Node 7:
    - (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9)
    <7, (0, 2, 4)>

9. Node 8:
    - (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9)
    <8, (2, 4, 9)>

10. Node 9:
    - (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8)
    <9, (5, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
