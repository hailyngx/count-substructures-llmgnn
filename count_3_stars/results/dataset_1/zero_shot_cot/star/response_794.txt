Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will identify all possible 3-stars by looking at each node and its neighbors.

We will check each node and see if it is connected to exactly three other nodes, which would form a 3-star. Let's denote the nodes as follows:
- For node 0: (1, 6, 7, 8, 9)
- For node 1: (0, 3, 4, 6, 7)
- For node 2: (9)
- For node 3: (1, 5)
- For node 4: (1, 5)
- For node 5: (3, 4)
- For node 6: (0, 1, 8, 9)
- For node 7: (0, 1)
- For node 8: (0, 6)
- For node 9: (0, 2, 6)

Now, let's list all the unique 3-stars found:
- <0, (1, 6, 7)>
- <1, (0, 3, 4)>
- <6, (0, 8, 9)>
- <9, (0, 2, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4].
