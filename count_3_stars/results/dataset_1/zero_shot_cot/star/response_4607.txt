Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Star with center node 0: (0, 3, 4, 9)
2. Star with center node 2: (2, 3, 5)
3. Star with center node 3: (3, 0, 2, 6)
4. Star with center node 4: (4, 0, 8)
5. Star with center node 6: (6, 3, 7)
6. Star with center node 7: (7, 1, 6)
7. Star with center node 8: (8, 4, 9)
8. Star with center node 9: (9, 0, 8)

Count of 3-stars: [8]
Unique 3-stars: <0, (3, 4, 9)>, <2, (3, 5)>, <3, (0, 2, 6)>, <4, (0, 8)>, <6, (3, 7)>, <7, (1, 6)>, <8, (4, 9)>, <9, (0, 8)>
