Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each node that forms a 3-star. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (2, 4, 8)>
<1, (4, 7, 9)>
<2, (0, 4, 7)>
<4, (0, 1, 8)>
<7, (1, 2, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
