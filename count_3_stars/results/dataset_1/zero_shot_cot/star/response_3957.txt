Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars, which are centered at each node in the graph. 

Let's determine the 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: No 3-star as it has only one edge.
- Node 1: No 3-star as it has only two edges.
- Node 2: <2, (0, 5, 8)>, <2, (3, 5, 9)>
- Node 3: No 3-star as it has only one edge.
- Node 4: No 3-star as it has only two edges.
- Node 5: <5, (1, 2, 7)>, <5, (2, 6, 7)>
- Node 6: <6, (1, 4, 7)>, <6, (4, 5, 7)>
- Node 7: <7, (4, 5, 6)>, <7, (5, 6, 9)>, <7, (6, 9, 2)>
- Node 8: No 3-star as it has only one edge.
- Node 9: No 3-star as it has only two edges.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7]. 

<2, (0, 5, 8)>, <2, (3, 5, 9)>, <5, (1, 2, 7)>, <5, (2, 6, 7)>, <6, (1, 4, 7)>, <6, (4, 5, 7)>, <7, (4, 5, 6)>
