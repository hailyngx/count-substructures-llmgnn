Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify all nodes that are connected to the central node by an edge, which in this case is node 4. These nodes are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8.

Next, for each of these nodes, let's check if they are connected to exactly two other nodes apart from the central node, forming a 3-star pattern. 

- For node 0, it is connected to nodes 4 and 5, forming a 3-star with center 0 and leaves 4, 5.
- For node 1, it is connected to node 4 only, which is not a 3-star.
- For node 2, it is connected to nodes 4 and 5, forming a 3-star with center 2 and leaves 4, 5.
- For node 3, it is connected to nodes 4 and 5, forming a 3-star with center 3 and leaves 4, 5.
- For node 5, it is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, forming only 3-stars <0, (4, 5)>, <2, (4, 5)>, <3, (4, 5)>, and <4, (0, 5)>.
- For node 8, it is connected to nodes 4 and 5, forming a 3-star with center 8 and leaves 4, 5.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4]. The unique 3-stars found are <0, (4, 5)>, <2, (4, 5)>, <3, (4, 5)>, and <4, (0, 5)>.
