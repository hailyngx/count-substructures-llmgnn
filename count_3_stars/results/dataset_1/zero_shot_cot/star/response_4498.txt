Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Starting from node 1: 
- (1, 5), (1, 6): <1, (5, 6)>
  
Moving to node 2: 
- (2, 3), (2, 8), (2, 9): <2, (3, 8, 9)>
- (2, 3), (2, 9): <2, (3, 9)>

Moving to node 3: 
- (3, 2), (3, 5): <3, (2, 5)>

Moving to node 4: No 3-star centered at node 4.

Moving to node 5: 
- (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 7): <5, (1, 3, 7)>
- (5, 3), (5, 7): <5, (3, 7)>
- (5, 1), (5, 3): <5, (1, 3)>

Moving to node 6: 
- (6, 1), (6, 4), (6, 8): <6, (1, 4, 8)>
- (6, 1), (6, 4): <6, (1, 4)>
- (6, 1), (6, 8): <6, (1, 8)>
- (6, 4), (6, 8): <6, (4, 8)>

Moving to node 7: No 3-star centered at node 7.

Moving to node 8: 
- (8, 2), (8, 6): <8, (2, 6)>

Moving to node 9: 
- (9, 2): No 3-star centered at node 9.

Count of 3-stars in the graph: [11]

Unique 3-stars in the graph: <1, (5, 6)>, <2, (3, 8, 9)>, <2, (3, 9)>, <3, (2, 5)>, <5, (1, 3, 7)>, <5, (3, 7)>, <5, (1, 3)>, <6, (1, 4, 8)>, <6, (1, 4)>, <6, (1, 8)>, <6, (4, 8)>
