Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars.

Let's start by listing the nodes that are directly connected to each node:
- Node 0: 2, 7
- Node 1: 7, 9
- Node 2: 0, 3
- Node 3: 2, 8
- Node 4: 8, 9
- Node 5: 6, 7, 8
- Node 6: 5
- Node 7: 0, 1, 5, 8, 9
- Node 8: 3, 4, 5, 7
- Node 9: 1, 4, 7

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 5, 8, 9. This creates the following 3-stars: 
  <7, (0, 5, 8)>
  <7, (1, 8, 9)>

There are a total of 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [2].
