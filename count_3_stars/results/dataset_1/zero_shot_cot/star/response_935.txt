Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern.

Let's list out the possible 3-stars below:

<2, (5, 8, 4)>
<3, (4, 6, 7)>
<4, (3, 5, 8)>
<5, (2, 4, 7)>
<6, (0, 3, 7)>
<7, (3, 5, 6)>
<8, (2, 4, 5)>
<9, (4)>

Counting them, we find that there are a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
