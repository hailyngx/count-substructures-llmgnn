Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 
In this case, we are looking for nodes that form a 3-star pattern with the central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<0, (5, 9, 1)>
<1, (0, 9, 6)>
<2, (0, 4, 6)>
<3, (0, 7, 5)>
<4, (2, 6, 0)>
<5, (0, 9, 3)>
<6, (1, 9, 2)>
<7, (3, 8, 0)>
<8, (7, 0, 0)>
<9, (0, 5, 1)>

There are a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
