Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- <0, (2, 5, 1)>
- <2, (0, 5, 4)>
- <5, (0, 2, 4)>
- <4, (2, 5, 9)>
- <7, (1, 8, 1)>
- <8, (6, 7, 9)>
- <1, (5, 7, 5)>
- <9, (4, 8, 9)>

Count of 3-stars: [8]
