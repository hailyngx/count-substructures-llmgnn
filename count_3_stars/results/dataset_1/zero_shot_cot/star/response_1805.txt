Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, as these nodes can be the center of a 3-star. 
Nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes: 0, 1, 5, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0: (0, 2, 3, 7)
- Node 2: (2, 0, 3, 7)
- Node 3: (3, 0, 1, 2), (3, 1, 5, 6), (3, 2, 5, 7)
- Node 7: (7, 0, 2, 3)

Count of 3-stars: [4]
Unique 3-stars: <0, (2, 3, 7)>, <2, (0, 3, 7)>, <3, (0, 1, 2)>, <3, (1, 5, 6)>, <3, (2, 5, 7)>, <7, (0, 2, 3)>
