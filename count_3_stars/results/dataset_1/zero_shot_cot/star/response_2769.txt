Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern.

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (2, 4, 7)>
<1, (2, 5, 6)>
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<4, (0, 2, 7)>
<6, (1, 8, 9)>
<8, (4, 6, 9)>
<9, (7, 8, 9)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars found in the graph gives us a total of [7].
