Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

The center node of a 3-star will have degree 3, and the three leaves will be directly connected to the center node.

Looking at the given edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:
1. <1, (5, 7, 8)>
2. <4, (6, 8, 9)>
3. <5, (1, 8, 8)>
4. <6, (4, 9, 6)>
5. <7, (1, 3, 1)>
6. <8, (1, 4, 5)>
7. <9, (6, 8, 9)>

There are 7 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the final count of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
