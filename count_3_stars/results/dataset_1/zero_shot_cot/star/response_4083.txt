Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can identify each instance where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Let's start by listing all the 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<0, (1, 5, 9)>

Now let's count the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph.
