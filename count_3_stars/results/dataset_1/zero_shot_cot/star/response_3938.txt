Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 7) (1, 9) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph. For a 3-star, the center node must be connected to exactly three other nodes.

Looking at the given edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (4, 5, 7)>
<1, (7, 9, -)>
<5, (0, 8, -)>
<7, (0, 1, 8)>
<9, (1, 3, 6)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in this graph.
