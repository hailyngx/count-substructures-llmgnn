Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central node and its leaves in each 3-star. 

The central node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a 3-star. We can start by checking each node to see if they are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's identify the 3-stars:
1. Node 0 is connected to 3, 4, and 9 - <0, (3, 4, 9)>
2. Node 1 is connected to 3, 4, and 9 - <1, (3, 4, 9)>
3. Node 2 is connected to 1, 3, and 9 - <2, (1, 3, 9)>
4. Node 3 is connected to 0, 1, and 2 - <3, (0, 1, 2)>
5. Node 4 is connected to 0, 1, and 7 - <4, (0, 1, 7)>
6. Node 5 is not connected to exactly three other nodes.
7. Node 6 is not connected to exactly three other nodes.
8. Node 7 is connected to 2, 3, and 4 - <7, (2, 3, 4)>
9. Node 8 is not connected to exactly three other nodes.
10. Node 9 is connected to 0, 1, and 2 - <9, (0, 1, 2)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6]. 

<0, (3, 4, 9)>
<1, (3, 4, 9)>
<2, (1, 3, 9)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<4, (0, 1, 7)>
<7, (2, 3, 4)>
