Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
Let's analyze the graph and count the number of 3-stars it contains.

Node 0: (0, 4), (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8), (0, 9) => 4 possible 3-star: <0, (4, 6, 7)>, <0, (4, 6, 8)>, <0, (4, 7, 9)>, <0, (6, 7, 8)>
Node 1: (1, 2), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 9) => 1 possible 3-star: <1, (2, 5, 6)>
Node 2: (2, 1), (2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 9) => 1 possible 3-star: <2, (6, 1, 7)>
Node 3: (3, 5), (3, 8) => No 3-star can be formed
Node 4: (4, 0), (4, 5), (4, 9) => 1 possible 3-star: <4, (0, 5, 9)>
Node 5: (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 7), (5, 8) => 1 possible 3-star: <5, (1, 4, 7)>
Node 6: (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2) => No 3-star can be formed
Node 7: (7, 0), (7, 2), (7, 5) => No 3-star can be formed
Node 8: (8, 0), (8, 3), (8, 5) => No 3-star can be formed
Node 9: (9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 4) => 1 possible 3-star: <9, (0, 1, 2)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8] and they are as follows: <0, (4, 6, 7)>, <0, (4, 6, 8)>, <0, (4, 7, 9)>, <0, (6, 7, 8)>, <1, (2, 5, 6)>, <2, (6, 1, 7)>, <4, (0, 5, 9)>, <5, (1, 4, 7)>.
