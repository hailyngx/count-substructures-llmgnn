Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's analyze the given graph step by step to identify the 3-stars:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 2 and 4.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 6, and 7.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0 and 6.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 8, and 9.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 5, 6, and 7.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 7.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 4.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 5, and 8.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 3, 7, and 9.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 3 and 8.

Now, let's count the 3-stars:

- By analyzing the connections, we can identify the following 3-stars:
    <0, (2, 4, 6)>
    <1, (3, 5, 7)>
    <3, (1, 4, 8)>
    <4, (0, 3, 6)>
    <7, (1, 4, 8)>
    
- Count of 3-stars: [5]

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
