Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify nodes with exactly 3 neighbors.  
From the given edges, we see that the nodes with exactly 3 neighbors are:  
- Node 0 (neighbors: 4, 5, 7, 8)  
- Node 3 (neighbors: 2, 6, 9)  
- Node 5 (neighbors: 0, 6, 9)  
- Node 8 (neighbors: 0, 4, 9)  
- Node 9 (neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8)  

Step 2: Count the number of 3-stars using these nodes as centers.  
- For Node 0: It forms 1 3-star.  
- For Node 3: It forms 1 3-star.  
- For Node 5: It forms 1 3-star.  
- For Node 8: It forms 1 3-star.  
- For Node 9: It forms 3 3-stars.  

Step 3: Calculate the total number of 3-stars.  
Total number of 3-stars = 1 (for Node 0) + 1 (for Node 3) + 1 (for Node 5) + 1 (for Node 8) + 3 (for Node 9) = 7  

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].  

<0, (4, 5, 7)>  
<3, (2, 6, 9)>  
<5, (0, 6, 9)>  
<8, (0, 4, 9)>  
<9, (1, 2, 3)>
