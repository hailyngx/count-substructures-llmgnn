Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes can potentially serve as the central nodes of 3-stars.

In this graph, nodes 0, 1, 3, 5, and 7 have exactly three edges incident on them, making them potential central nodes for 3-stars. Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. <0, (1, 2, 7)>
2. <1, (0, 2, -)>
3. <2, (0, 1, 7)>
4. <3, (2, 9, -)>
5. <5, (9, -, -)>
6. <7, (0, 2, -)>

Hence, there are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
