Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (8, 4) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to the central node in a 3-star pattern. 
Since a 3-star graph has the center node connected to exactly three other nodes, we need to find nodes that have exactly three incident edges.

Nodes with 3 incident edges:    
- Node 0
- Node 3
- Node 4
- Node 5

Now, let's find the unique 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (3, 6, 9)>
<3, (0, 6, 9)>
<4, (1, 8, 5)>
<5, (2, 6, 4)>

There are a total of 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph.  
So, the final answer is [4].
