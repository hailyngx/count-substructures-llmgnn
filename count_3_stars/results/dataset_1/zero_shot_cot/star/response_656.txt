Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph:

- 3-star with center 0: <0, (2, 5)>
- 3-star with center 1: <1, (2, 4, 6)>
- 3-star with center 2: <2, (0, 1, 6)>
- 3-star with center 3: Not present
- 3-star with center 4: <4, (1, 3, 7)>
- 3-star with center 5: Not present
- 3-star with center 6: Not present
- 3-star with center 7: Not present
- 3-star with center 8: Not present
- 3-star with center 9: <9, (2, 3, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
