Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
Let's first identify the central nodes in the graph, which are the nodes with exactly three neighbors. 

In this graph, nodes 0, 1, 2, 5, and 9 are central nodes because they each have exactly three neighbors. 

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph by considering each central node. As we count, we will list the unique 3-stars found:

1. Central node 0:
    - <0, (3, 4)> - 1 3-star
    - <0, (3, 9)> - 1 3-star
    - Total 3-stars: [2]

2. Central node 1:
    - <1, (5, 6)> - 1 3-star
    - Total 3-stars: [3]

3. Central node 2:
    - <2, (5, 8)> - 1 3-star
    - <2, (5, 9)> - 1 3-star
    - Total 3-stars: [5]

4. Central node 5:
    - <5, (1, 2)> - 1 3-star
    - Total 3-stars: [6]

5. Central node 9:
    - <9, (2, 3)> - 1 3-star
    - Total 3-stars: [7]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
