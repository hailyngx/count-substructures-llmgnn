Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars present in the graph. 

Starting from the first node, we can explore each node to see if it forms a 3-star with its neighbors. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars found:

<0, (3, 4, 8)>
<1, (3, 7, 9)>
<3, (0, 1, 8)>
<4, (0, 9, 5)>
<5, (6, 7, 9)>
<6, (5, 7, 9)>
<7, (1, 2, 3)>
<8, (0, 3, 9)>
<9, (1, 4, 5)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars: [9]
