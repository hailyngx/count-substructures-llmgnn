Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the central node of each 3-star. 
Next, we look for 3 nodes connected to the central node, forming a 3-star. 

Based on the provided edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:

<0, (2, 8, 1)>
<1, (4, 5, 7)>
<2, (0, 8, 9)>
<3, (4, 9, 6)>
<4, (1, 3, 6)>
<5, (1)>
<6, (4, 9)>
<7, (1)>
<8, (0, 1, 2, 9)>
<9, (3, 6, 8)>

Now, we count the total number of 3-stars found, which is [10].
