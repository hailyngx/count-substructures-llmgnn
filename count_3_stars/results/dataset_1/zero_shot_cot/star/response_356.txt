Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's go step-by-step to find the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Identify the central nodes in the graph. Central nodes are nodes with exactly 3 edges connected to them.
    - Central nodes: 0, 2, 3, 9

2. For each central node, identify the three nodes that are connected to it. These will be the leaves of the 3-star.
    - For central node 0: (3, 5, 6)
    - For central node 2: (1, 8, 9)
    - For central node 3: (5, 7, 9)
    - For central node 9: (0, 2, 6)

3. List the unique 3-stars found:
    - <0, (3, 5, 6)>
    - <2, (1, 8, 9)>
    - <3, (5, 7, 9)>
    - <9, (0, 2, 6)>

4. Calculate the total number of 3-stars in the graph by counting the unique 3-stars found:
    - Total number of 3-stars: [4]

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
