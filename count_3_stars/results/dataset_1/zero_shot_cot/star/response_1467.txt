Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in this graph step-by-step.

Step 1: Identify the nodes with exactly 3 neighbors (degree 3). 
From the given edges, the nodes with degree 3 are: 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 9.

Step 2: For each node with degree 3, check if it forms a 3-star. 
- For node 0: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 8) and (0, 9) indicate a 3-star <0, (1, 3, 8)> and a 3-star <0, (1, 3, 9)>.
- For node 2: (2, 1), (2, 5), (2, 7) indicate a 3-star <2, (1, 5, 7)>.
- For node 4: (4, 1), (4, 9) indicate a 3-star <4, (1, 9)>.
- For node 5: (5, 2), (5, 6), (5, 8) indicate a 3-star <5, (2, 6, 8)>.
- For node 6: (6, 1), (6, 5), (6, 7) indicate a 3-star <6, (1, 5, 7)>.
- For node 9: (9, 0), (9, 4), (9, 8) indicate a 3-star <9, (0, 4, 8)>.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph. 
<0, (1, 3, 8)>, <0, (1, 3, 9)>, <2, (1, 5, 7)>, <4, (1, 9)>, <5, (2, 6, 8)>, <6, (1, 5, 7)>, <9, (0, 4, 8)> 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
