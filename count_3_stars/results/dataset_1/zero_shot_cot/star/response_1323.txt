Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step-by-step:
1. Starting from node 0:
   - Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 7, and 9.
   - This forms one 3-star with 0 as the center and nodes 4, 5, and 7 as leaves. <0, (4, 5, 7)>
  
2. Next, let's check the other nodes:
   - By examining all nodes, we see that there are no additional 3-stars in this graph.
  
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1].  
The unique 3-star found is <0, (4, 5, 7)>.
