Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars in the graph. 

Looking at the graph, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<1, (3, 5, 6)>
<2, (3, 7, 8)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<4, (5, 7, 9)>
<5, (0, 1, 4)>
<6, (0, 1, 7)>
<7, (1, 2, 4)>
<8, (1, 2, 9)>
<9, (5, 7, 8)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we have a total of [10] 3-star graphs in the given graph. 

Therefore, the final answer is [10].
