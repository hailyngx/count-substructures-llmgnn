Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can identify all the nodes connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

In this graph, the nodes and their connections are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 4
- Node 1: 0, 7
- Node 2: 4, 5
- Node 3: 6, 7
- Node 4: 0, 2, 7, 9
- Node 5: 2
- Node 6: 3, 7, 8
- Node 7: 1, 3, 4, 6, 9
- Node 8: 6
- Node 9: 4, 7

From the above connections, we can see that the nodes forming 3-stars are:
- Node 4: 0, 2, 7
- Node 7: 1, 3, 4, 6, 9

Therefore, there are two unique 3-stars in this graph:
<4, (0, 2, 7)>
<7, (1, 3, 4, 6, 9)>

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is: [2].
