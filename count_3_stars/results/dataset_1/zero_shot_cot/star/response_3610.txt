Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (2, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 8) (4, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 6: <0, (1, 2, 6)>
2. Node 3 is connected to nodes 6, 8, and 9: <3, (6, 8, 9)>
3. Node 4 is connected to nodes 8 and 9 (but not forming a 3-star pattern).
4. Nodes 1, 2, 5, 7 do not form 3-stars in the given graph. 

Therefore, there are a total of [2] 3-stars in the graph.
