Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star. 

The unique 3-stars in this graph are as follows:
<0, (4, 9, 2)>
<1, (2, 4, 0)>
<2, (1, 9, 4)>
<3, (4, 6, 9)>
<4, (0, 2, 3)>
<5, (7, 6, 9)>
<6, (3, 7, 9)>
<7, (5, 6, 9)>
<8, (6, 9, 7)>
<9, (0, 2, 4)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars:
