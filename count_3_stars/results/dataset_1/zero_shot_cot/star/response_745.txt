Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes (3-stars).

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (3, 9, 3)>
<1, (5, 6, 7)>
<2, (4, 6, 6)>
<3, (0, 9, 9)>
<4, (2, 6, 6)>
<5, (1, 9, 9)>
<6, (1, 2, 4)>
<7, (1, 6, 8)>
<8, (7, 7, 7)>
<9, (1, 3, 5)>

Now, we count the number of unique 3-stars listed above: [10].
