Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the given edges, we can identify the following 3-stars: 
<1, (2, 5, 9)>
<4, (7, 9, 4)>
<5, (1, 6, 1)>
<9, (1, 4, 8)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
