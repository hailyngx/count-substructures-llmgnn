Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will look for instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify all the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (1, 8, 8)>
<1, (0, 3, 3)>
<2, (6, 9, 9)>
<3, (1, 4, 5)>
<4, (3, 7, 8)>
<5, (3, 7, 7)>
<6, (2, 3, 8)>
<7, (4, 5, 7)>
<8, (0, 4, 6)>
<9, (2, 6, 8)>

There are a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
