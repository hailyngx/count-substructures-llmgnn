Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 6) (3, 0) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the graph, we first identify all the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes can serve as the central nodes of the 3-stars. Then, we look at the edges to determine which nodes are connected to each central node to form the 3-stars.

The nodes connected to exactly three other nodes are: 0, 1, 6, and 8.

For each of these central nodes, we form the 3-stars using the edges provided:

- For node 0, the 3-stars are: <0, (1, 5, 6)>, <0, (3, 5, 6)>, <0, (5, 6, 7)>, <0, (6, 7, 8)>, <0, (6, 7, 8)> (Note: The last 3-star appears twice due to the redundant edge).
- For node 1, the 3-star is: <1, (0, 5, 6)>.
- For node 6, the 3-stars are: <6, (0, 1, 7)>, <6, (0, 1, 8)>, <6, (0, 7, 8)>.
- For node 8, the 3-stars are: <8, (0, 1, 6)>, <8, (6, 1, 7)>.

Counting the unique 3-stars, we have:

<0, (1, 5, 6)>, <0, (3, 5, 6)>, <0, (5, 6, 7)>, <0, (6, 7, 8)>, <1, (0, 5, 6)>, <6, (0, 1, 7)>, <6, (0, 1, 8)>, <6, (0, 7, 8)>, <8, (0, 1, 6)>, <8, (6, 1, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
