Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them. These nodes will serve as the centers of our potential 3-stars. 

The nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them are: 1, 6, and 7. 

Next, let's look at each of these nodes and find the neighboring nodes connected to them:

- For node 1: (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8)
- For node 6: (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 9)
- For node 7: (7, 1), (7, 4), (7, 9)

Now, let's construct the 3-stars based on the nodes:

<1, (5, 6, 8)>
<6, (1, 3, 9)>
<7, (1, 4, 9)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
