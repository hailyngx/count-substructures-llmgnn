Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1 and 7: <0, (1, 7)>
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 7, and 8: <1, (0, 7, 8)>
3. Node 2 is connected to node 8: This node doesn't form a 3-star.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 5 and 6: <3, (5, 6)>
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 7 and 9: <4, (7, 9)>
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 3 and 6: This node doesn't form a 3-star.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 7: <6, (3, 5, 7)>
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, and 6: <7, (0, 1, 4)>, <7, (1, 4, 6)>
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 1 and 2: This node doesn't form a 3-star.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 4 and 8: This node doesn't form a 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6]. 
The unique 3-stars are <0, (1, 7)>, <1, (0, 7, 8)>, <3, (5, 6)>, <4, (7, 9)>, <6, (3, 5, 7)>, and <7, (0, 1, 4)>.
