Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

First, let's list all the nodes along with their neighbors:
- Node 0: 2, 4, 5, 7
- Node 1: 3, 4, 7
- Node 2: 0
- Node 3: 1, 7, 8, 9
- Node 4: 0, 1, 5, 8
- Node 5: 0, 4, 6
- Node 6: 5, 9
- Node 7: 0, 1, 3
- Node 8: 3, 4
- Node 9: 3, 6

Let's identify the 3-stars now:
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<1, (3, 4, 7)>
<3, (1, 7, 8)>
<4, (0, 1, 5)>
<5, (0, 4, 6)>
<6, (5, 9, 0)>
<7, (0, 1, 3)>
<8, (3, 4, 9)>
<9, (3, 6, 8)>

So, there are 9 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the final answer is [9].
