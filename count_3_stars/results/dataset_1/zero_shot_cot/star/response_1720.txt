Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars in the graph are:
<0, (7, 4, 8)>
<1, (9, 3, 4)>
<2, (5, 8, 6)>

Count of 3-stars: [3]
