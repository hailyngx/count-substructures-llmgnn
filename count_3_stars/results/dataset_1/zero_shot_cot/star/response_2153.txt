Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

The center node can be connected to 3 other nodes. Let's go through each node as the center node and check if it forms a 3-star:

1. Center node 0:
    - (0, 2, 3, 4) forms a 3-star.
    - (0, 4, 6, 9) forms a 3-star.
    - Total 3-stars with center node 0: <0, (2, 3, 4)>, <0, (4, 6, 9)>

2. Center node 1:
    - (1, 3, 4, 9) forms a 3-star.
    - Total 3-stars with center node 1: <1, (3, 4, 9)>

3. Center node 2:
    - (2, 4, 5, 9) forms a 3-star.
    - Total 3-stars with center node 2: <2, (4, 5, 9)>

4. Center node 3:
    - (3, 0, 1, 5) forms a 3-star.
    - Total 3-stars with center node 3: <3, (0, 1, 5)>

5. Center node 4:
    - (4, 0, 1, 2) forms a 3-star.
    - (4, 5, 6, 7) forms a 3-star.
    - Total 3-stars with center node 4: <4, (0, 1, 2)>, <4, (5, 6, 7)>

6. Center node 5:
    - (5, 2, 3, 4) forms a 3-star.
    - Total 3-stars with center node 5: <5, (2, 3, 4)>

7. Center node 6:
    - (6, 0, 4, 8) forms a 3-star.
    - Total 3-stars with center node 6: <6, (0, 4, 8)>

8. Center node 7:
    - (7, 4, 8, 9) forms a 3-star.
    - Total 3-stars with center node 7: <7, (4, 8, 9)>

9. Center node 8:
    - (8, 3, 6, 7) forms a 3-star.
    - Total 3-stars with center node 8: <8, (3, 6, 7)>

10. Center node 9:
    - (9, 0, 1, 7) forms a 3-star.
    - Total 3-stars with center node 9: <9, (0, 1, 7)>

Counting unique 3-stars, we get [] brackets.
