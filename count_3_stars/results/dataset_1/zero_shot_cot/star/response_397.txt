Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

The nodes with three neighbors are:
- Node 0 (neighbors: 5, 6, 9)
- Node 1 (neighbors: 6, 7, None)
- Node 2 (neighbors: 4, 6, 8, 9)
- Node 3 (neighbors: 4, 5, 9)
- Node 5 (neighbors: 0, 3, 4, 7)
- Node 6 (neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 4, 7)
- Node 7 (neighbors: 1, 5, 6)
- Node 9 (neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 4)

We can see that Node 1 has only 2 neighbors, so it does not form a 3-star. 

The 3-stars in the graph are as follows (in no particular order):
<0, (5, 6, 9)>
<3, (4, 5, 9)>
<4, (2, 3, 5)>
<4, (2, 4, 6)>
<4, (3, 4, 9)>
<4, (5, 6, 7)>
<5, (0, 3, 7)>
<6, (0, 1, 7)>
<9, (0, 2, 3)>
<9, (2, 4, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
