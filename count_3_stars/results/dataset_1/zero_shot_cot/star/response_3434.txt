Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's analyze the given graph to count the number of 3-stars.

First, let's identify the nodes connected to each node:
- Node 0: 1 edge → connected to Node 2
- Node 1: 1 edge → connected to Node 8
- Node 2: 4 edges → connected to Nodes 0, 4, 6, and 8
- Node 3: 2 edges → connected to Nodes 5 and 7
- Node 4: 4 edges → connected to Nodes 2, 5, 7, and 9
- Node 5: 4 edges → connected to Nodes 3, 4, 8, and 9
- Node 6: 2 edges → connected to Nodes 2 and 8
- Node 7: 2 edges → connected to Nodes 3 and 4
- Node 8: 5 edges → connected to Nodes 1, 2, 5, 6, and 9
- Node 9: 3 edges → connected to Nodes 4, 5, and 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph by looking at each node and its neighbors:
- Node 2: <2, (0, 4, 6)>
- Node 4: <4, (2, 5, 7)>
- Node 5: <5, (3, 4, 8)>
- Node 8: <8, (1, 2, 6)>
- Node 9: <9, (4, 5, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: 
<2, (0, 4, 6)>, 
<4, (2, 5, 7)>, 
<5, (3, 4, 8)>, 
<8, (1, 2, 6)>, 
<9, (4, 5, 8)>.
