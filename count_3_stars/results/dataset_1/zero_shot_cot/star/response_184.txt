Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the given graph. We need to look for nodes that have exactly 3 edges connected to them.

From the given edges:
- Node 0 has edges with nodes 3, 7, and 9.
- Node 2 has edges with nodes 3 and 6.
- Node 3 has edges with nodes 0, 2, 5, 6, and 9.
- Node 6 has edges with nodes 2, 3, 4, and 7.
- Node 7 has edges with nodes 0, 6, and 8.
- Node 9 has edges with nodes 0, 3, and 4.

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 6.

[6]

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (3, 7, 9)>
<2, (3, 6, -)>
<3, (0, 2, 9)>
<6, (2, 3, 7)>
<7, (0, 6, 8)>
<9, (0, 3, 4)>
