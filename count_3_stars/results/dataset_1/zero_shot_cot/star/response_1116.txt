Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 

First, let's list down the nodes that are connected to node 0: {4, 5, 6}
- <0, (4, 5, 6)>

Next, let's list down the nodes that are connected to node 1: {2, 4}
- <1, (2, 4)>

Then, the nodes connected to node 3: {5, 7}
- <3, (5, 7)>

Finally, the nodes connected to node 6: {4, 5, 8}
- <6, (4, 5, 8)>

Counting all the unique 3-stars gives us a total of 4.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
