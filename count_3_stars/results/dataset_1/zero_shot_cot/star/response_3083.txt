Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
Let's first find the nodes that form 3-stars in the given graph based on the definition provided.

Since a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can identify the central nodes by checking for nodes with 3 edges. 

Let's list the central nodes first:
- Node 0 has 5 edges (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6)
- Node 1 has 2 edges (1, 7), (1, 9)
- Node 4 has 5 edges (4, 0), (4, 3), (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 9)

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- <0, (2, 3, 5)>
- <1, (7, 9, 4)>

Therefore, there are [2] 3-stars in the given graph.
