Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's start by identifying the 3-stars:

1. Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 8. This forms a 3-star: <2, (4, 6, 8)>
2. Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 6. This forms a 3-star: <8, (2, 3, 6)>
3. Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 7, and 2. This forms a 3-star: <9, (5, 7, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
