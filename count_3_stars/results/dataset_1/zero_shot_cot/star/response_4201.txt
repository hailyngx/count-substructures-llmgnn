Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the graph. A 3-star should have a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

The central nodes are:
- Node 0 (connected to nodes 1, 6, and 1)
- Node 1 (connected to nodes 0, 5, and 5)
- Node 3 (connected to nodes 2, 6, and 7)
- Node 7 (connected to nodes 2, 3, and 8)
- Node 8 (connected to nodes 3, 7, and 7)

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph. 

[5]

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
- <0, (1, 6, 1)>
- <1, (0, 5, 5)>
- <3, (2, 6, 7)>
- <7, (2, 3, 8)>
- <8, (3, 7, 7)>
