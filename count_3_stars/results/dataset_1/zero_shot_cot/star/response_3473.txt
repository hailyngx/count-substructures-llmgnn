Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars. 

Looking at the graph, the 3-stars can be formed with the central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's go ahead and list the unique 3-stars present in the graph:

1. <0, (1, 2, 5)>
2. <1, (0, 4, 9)>
3. <2, (0, 4, 8)>
4. <4, (1, 2, 3)>
5. <5, (0, 9, -)>
6. <6, (4, 8, -)>
7. <8, (2, 6, 9)>
8. <9, (1, 2, 5)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
