Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 

First, let's list all the nodes with their adjacent nodes:

- Node 0: 4, 5, 7
- Node 2: 5, 6, 8
- Node 3: 6
- Node 4: 0
- Node 5: 0, 2, 8
- Node 6: 2, 3, 8
- Node 7: 0, 8, 9
- Node 8: 2, 5, 6, 7
- Node 9: 7

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars by examining each possible central node:
- For Node 0: (0, 4, 5), (0, 5, 7) -> <0, (4, 5, 7)>
- For Node 2: (2, 5, 6), (2, 5, 8) -> <2, (5, 6, 8)>
- For Node 3: No 3-star
- For Node 4: No 3-star
- For Node 5: No 3-star
- For Node 6: No 3-star
- For Node 7: No 3-star
- For Node 8: (8, 5, 6), (8, 5, 7) -> <8, (5, 6, 7)>

Now, count the total number of 3-stars based on the above:
