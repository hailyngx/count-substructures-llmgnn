Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, 6, 7.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, 6, 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 6.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 1.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 6, 7.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 5, 8.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 5.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 6, 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 8.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:

<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<1, (0, 2, 6)>
<6, (0, 1, 2)>
<6, (5, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
