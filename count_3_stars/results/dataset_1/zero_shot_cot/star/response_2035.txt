Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node has exactly 3 edges connected to it, forming a 3-star pattern. 

Let's list the 3-stars present in the graph:

<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<2, (0, 3, 9)>
<3, (2, 9, 6)>
<4, (7, 5, 8)>
<5, (6, 7, 8)>
<6, (5, 7, 9)>
<7, (4, 5, 6)>
<9, (2, 3, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
