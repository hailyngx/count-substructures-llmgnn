Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 5, and 6: <1, (2, 5, 6)>
2. Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, and 6: <2, (1, 3, 6)>
3. Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 7, and 8: <5, (1, 7, 8)>
4. Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 2, and 7: <6, (1, 2, 7)>
5. Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 8, and 6: <7, (5, 8, 6)>
6. Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 7, and 9: <8, (3, 7, 9)>
7. Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 2, and 3: <9, (0, 2, 3)>

There are 7 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
