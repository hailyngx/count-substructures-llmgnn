Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
We can identify the 3-stars in the given graph by looking for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step by step:

1. First, let's identify nodes that have three edges connected to them:
   - Node 0 has edges with nodes 1, 6, and 7.
   - Node 1 has edges with nodes 0, 6, and 9.
   - Node 4 has edges with nodes 5, 8, and 9.
   - Node 8 has edges with nodes 3, 4, and 5.

2. Next, let's identify the 3-stars based on the nodes found in step 1:
   - Node 0 is the center: <0, (1, 6, 7)>
   - Node 1 is the center: <1, (0, 6, 9)>
   - Node 4 is the center: <4, (5, 8, 9)>
   - Node 8 is the center: <8, (3, 4, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
