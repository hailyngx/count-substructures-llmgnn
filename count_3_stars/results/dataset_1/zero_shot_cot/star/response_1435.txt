Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify the center nodes in the graph.

The center nodes are the nodes with exactly three neighbors. Based on the given edges, the possible center nodes are 2, 5, 8, and 1.

Step 2: For each center node, find the 3-stars.

For center node 2:
- <2, (3, 6, 9)>
- <2, (6, 3, 9)>
[<2, (3, 6, 9)>]

For center node 5:
- <5, (3, 6, 9)>
- <5, (6, 3, 9)>
[<5, (3, 6, 9)>]

For center node 8:
No 3-stars exist around center node 8.

For center node 1:
No 3-stars exist around center node 1.

Step 3: Count the total number of unique 3-stars.

Total number of unique 3-stars: [2]
