Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0:
    - <0, (5, 6, 8)>

2. Node 1:
    - <1, (4, 5, 7)>

3. Node 2:
    - <2, (4, 7, 0)>

4. Node 3:
    - No 3-star as it has only one edge.

5. Node 4:
    - <4, (1, 2, 6)>

6. Node 5:
    - <5, (0, 1, 6)>
    - <5, (6, 8, 9)>

7. Node 6:
    - <6, (0, 3, 4)>
    - <6, (4, 5, 8)>

8. Node 7:
    - <7, (1, 2, 8)>
    - <7, (8, 9, 5)>

9. Node 8:
    - <8, (0, 4, 5)>
    - <8, (5, 6, 7)>

10. Node 9:
    - No 3-star as it has only two edges.

Count of 3-stars in the given graph: [10]
