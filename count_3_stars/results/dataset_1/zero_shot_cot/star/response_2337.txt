Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-star graphs in the given graph:

1. Start by identifying the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will serve as the centers of the 3-stars.

From the given edges, we can see that nodes 1, 3, 5, and 8 meet this criteria.

2. For each of these nodes, list all possible 3-stars that can be formed with them as the center:

- For node 1: None, as it is connected to only two other nodes.
- For node 3: <3, (1, 7, 8)>, <3, (5, 7, 8)>
- For node 5: None, as it is connected to only two other nodes.
- For node 8: None, as it is connected to only two other nodes.

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-star graphs in the given graph is [2].  

The 3-stars are <3, (1, 7, 8)>, <3, (5, 7, 8)>.
