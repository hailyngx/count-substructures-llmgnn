Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
The central node of a 3-star can be any node in the graph. We will iterate through all nodes and check each one to see if it is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's start by listing down all possible 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<1, (0, 3, 9)>
<2, (3, 9, -)>
<3, (1, 2, 7)>
<5, (0, -, -)>
<6, (0, 7, -)>
<7, (3, 6, -)>
<8, (3, -, -)>
<9, (1, 2, -)>

Now, we count the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph:

[9]
