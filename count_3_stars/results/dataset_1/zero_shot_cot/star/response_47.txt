Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (4, 0) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 6) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will be the potential centers of the 3-stars. 

From the given edges, we can see that nodes 0, 1, and 9 are each connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Now, let's find all the possible 3-stars centered at these nodes. 

For node 0:
1. <0, (4, 9, 0)>
2. <0, (9, 4, 0)>

For node 1:
3. <1, (2, 6, 1)>
4. <1, (6, 2, 1)>

For node 9:
5. <9, (0, 5, 9)>
6. <9, (5, 0, 9)>

Finally, count the total number of 3-stars.
