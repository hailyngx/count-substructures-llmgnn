Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
We need to identify the 3-stars in this graph. 

Let's list the 3-stars step by step:

1. Node 2: <2, (1, 3, 7)>
2. Node 3: Not a central node of any 3-star.
3. Node 6: Not a central node of any 3-star.
4. Node 7: <7, (2, 5, 8)>
5. Node 8: <8, (4, 6, 7)>
6. Node 9: <9, (0, 2, -)>

Therefore, there are [3] 3-stars in the given graph. Inside brackets [] is the final answer.
