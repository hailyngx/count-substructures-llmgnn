Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes and their adjacent nodes to find the 3-stars in the graph.

Central Node 1:
- Connected to nodes 0, 3, and 4
  - 3-star: <1, (0, 3, 4)>

Central Node 3:
- Connected to nodes 1, 2, and 5
  - 3-star: <3, (1, 2, 5)>

Central Node 4:
- Connected to nodes 1, 7, and 9
  - 3-star: <4, (1, 7, 9)>

Central Node 6:
- Connected to nodes 1, 9, and does not form a 3-star

Central Node 8:
- Connected to nodes 3, 5, and 9
  - 3-star: <8, (3, 5, 9)>

There are 3 unique 3-stars in the given graph. So, the count of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
