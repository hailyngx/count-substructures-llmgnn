Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through each node to identify the 3-stars.

Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 9.
Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 5.
Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 7, and no other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to nodes 6, 7, and 9.
Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, and 5.
Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 6, and 8.
Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, and 5.
Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, and 8.
Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 7, and no other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and no other nodes.

Therefore, the 3-stars in the graph are:
<0, (1, 4, 9)>
<1, (0, 4, 5)>
<3, (6, 7, 9)>

[The total number of 3-stars is 3]
