Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star. Here are the 3-stars found in the given graph:

[6]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1].
