Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the central nodes connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Let's identify the 3-stars:
- Central node 1: (1, 2, 3), (1, 3, 7)
- Central node 2: (2, 1, 3), (2, 3, 5)
- Central node 3: (3, 1, 2), (3, 2, 4), (3, 4, 7)
- Central node 4: (4, 3, 5), (4, 5, 7), (4, 7, 9)
- Central node 5: (5, 2, 4)
- Central node 7: (7, 1, 3), (7, 3, 4), (7, 4, 8), (7, 8, 9)
- Central node 8: (8, 0, 6), (8, 6, 7)
- Central node 9: (9, 4, 6), (9, 6, 7)

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [11]. 
The unique 3-stars found are <1, (2, 3, 7)>, <2, (3, 5, 1)>, <3, (2, 4, 7)>, <4, (5, 7, 3)>, <5, (2, 4, 7)>, <7, (4, 8, 3)>, <8, (0, 6, 7)>, and <9, (4, 6, 7)>.
