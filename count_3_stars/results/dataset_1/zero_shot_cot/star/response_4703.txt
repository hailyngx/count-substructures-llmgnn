Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 0) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first identify all the unique 3-stars in the graph. A 3-star graph contains one center node connected to three other nodes by edges.

Let's list the unique 3-stars present in the given graph:
<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<4, (0, 2, 5)>
<9, (1, 8, 0)>

Thus, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
