Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify the nodes that form 3-star patterns. 

1. Node 0: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 7)
   <0, (1, 3, 5)>
   <0, (1, 5, 7)>
   <0, (1, 3, 7)>

2. Node 1: (1, 0), (1, 7), (1, 8), (1, 9)
   <1, (0, 8, 9)>
   <1, (0, 7, 8)>
   <1, (0, 7, 9)>

3. Node 3: (3, 0), (3, 6), (3, 8), (3, 9)
   <3, (0, 8, 9)>
   <3, (0, 6, 8)>
   <3, (0, 6, 9)>

4. Node 5: (5, 0), (5, 9)
   <5, (0, 9, x)> (No other connection, so only one possible 3-star)

5. Node 6: (6, 3), (6, 8)
   <6, (3, x, 8)> (No other connection, so only one possible 3-star)

6. Node 7: (7, 0), (7, 1), (7, 2)
   <7, (0, 1, 2)>

7. Node 8: (8, 1), (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 6)
   <8, (1, 2, 3)>
   <8, (1, 2, 6)>
   <8, (1, 3, 6)>

8. Node 9: (9, 1), (9, 3), (9, 5)
   <9, (1, 3, x)> (No other connection, so only one possible 3-star)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].  
The unique 3-stars found are <0, (1, 3, 5)>, <0, (1, 5, 7)>, <0, (1, 3, 7)>, <1, (0, 8, 9)>, <1, (0, 7, 8)>, <1, (0, 7, 9)>, <3, (0, 8, 9)>, <3, (0, 6, 8)>, <3, (0, 6, 9)>, <5, (0, 9, x)>, <6, (3, x, 8)>, <7, (0, 1, 2)>, <8, (1, 2, 3)>, <8, (1, 2, 6)>, <8, (1, 3, 6)>.
