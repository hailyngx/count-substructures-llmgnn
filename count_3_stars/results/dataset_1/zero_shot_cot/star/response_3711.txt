Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars. 
The nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes are: 0, 1, 4, 5, 8, and 9.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9, forming 3-stars: 
    - <0, (1, 4, 5)>
    - <0, (1, 4, 6)>
    - <0, (1, 4, 7)>
    - <0, (1, 4, 9)>
    - <0, (1, 5, 6)>
    - <0, (1, 5, 7)>
    - <0, (1, 5, 9)>
    - <0, (4, 5, 6)>
    - <0, (4, 5, 7)>
    - <0, (4, 5, 9)>
    - Total 3-stars for node 0 = 10

- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, 5, and 8, forming 3-stars:
    - <1, (0, 3, 5)>
    - <1, (0, 4, 5)>
    - <1, (0, 4, 8)>
    - <1, (0, 5, 8)>
    - <1, (3, 4, 5)>
    - <1, (4, 5, 8)>
    - Total 3-stars for node 1 = 6

- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 9, forming 3-stars:
    - <4, (0, 1, 9)>
    - Total 3-stars for node 4 = 1

- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 2, forming 3-stars:
    - <5, (0, 1, 2)>
    - Total 3-stars for node 5 = 1

- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 6, 7, and 9, forming 3-stars: 
    - <8, (1, 3, 9)>
    - Total 3-stars for node 8 = 1

- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 8, forming 3-stars: 
    - <9, (0, 4, 8)>
    - Total 3-stars for node 9 = 1

Finally, adding up the total 3-stars for each node: 10 + 6 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 20

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [20]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<0, (1, 4, 7)>
<0, (1, 4, 9)>
<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<0, (1, 5, 9)>
<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<0, (4, 5, 7)>
<0, (4, 5, 9)>
<1, (0, 3, 5)>
<1, (0, 4, 5)>
<1, (0, 4, 8)>
<1, (0, 5, 8)>
<1, (3, 4, 5)>
<1, (4, 5, 8)>
<4, (0, 1, 9)>
<5, (0, 1, 2)>
<8, (1, 3, 9)>
<9, (0, 4, 8)>
