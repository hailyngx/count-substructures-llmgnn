Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's first identify the central nodes of the 3-stars in the given graph based on the definition provided. The central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

From the given edges, the central nodes and their corresponding leaves are:
- Central node 0: Leaves {1, 2, 4, 9}
- Central node 1: Leaves {0, 5, 7, 9}
- Central node 2: Leaves {0, 3, 4}
- Central node 4: Leaves {0, 2}
- Central node 5: Leaves {1, 9}
- Central node 6: Leaves {7, 9}
- Central node 7: Leaves {1, 6, 8}
- Central node 9: Leaves {0, 1, 5, 6}

Next, let's count the number of unique 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<1, (0, 5, 7)>
<2, (0, 3, 4)>
<5, (1, 9)>
<6, (7, 9)>
<7, (1, 6, 8)>
<9, (0, 1, 5)>
