Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's find all the 3-stars in the given graph.

<0, (1, 6, 8)>
<1, (0, 2, 9)>
<2, (1, 9, -)>
<3, (4, 5, 6)>
<4, (3, 5, 9)>
<5, (3, 4, 6)>
<6, (0, 3, 5)>
<7, (9, -, -)>
<8, (0, 3, 9)>
<9, (1, 4, 5)>

There are [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
