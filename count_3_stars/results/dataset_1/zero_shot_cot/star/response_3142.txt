Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each possible 3-star configuration. 

Let's list all the 3-star configurations:

1. <0, (1, 6, 7)>
2. <1, (0, 2, 3)>
3. <2, (1, 4, 9)>
4. <3, (1, 6, 9)>
5. <4, (2, 6, -)>
6. <5, (6, - , -)>
7. <6, (0, 3, 4)>
8. <7, (0, 6, 9)>
9. <9, (2, 3, 7)>

Now, let's count the unique 3-stars: <0, (1, 6, 7)>, <1, (0, 2, 3)>, <2, (1, 4, 9)>, <3, (1, 6, 9)>, <4, (2, 6, -)>, <5, (6, - , -)>, <6, (0, 3, 4)>, <7, (0, 6, 9)>, <9, (2, 3, 7)>.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
