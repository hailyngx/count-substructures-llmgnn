Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find the unique occurrences of 3-stars with a central node and three leaves. Let's break down the steps:

1. Identify the nodes that form 3-stars in the graph.
2. Count the total number of unique 3-stars.
3. Provide the final answer in brackets.

Step 1: Identify the nodes that form 3-stars in the graph.
- Node 0: (0, 2), (0, 8)
- Node 2: (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 8), (2, 9)
- Node 3: (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (3, 8)
- Node 4: (4, 3), (4, 5)
- Node 5: (5, 4), (5, 8)
- Node 6: (6, 3), (6, 7), (6, 9)
- Node 7: (7, 6), (7, 8)
- Node 8: (8, 0), (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 5), (8, 7)
- Node 9: (9, 2), (9, 6)

Step 2: Count the total number of unique 3-stars.
- We can see the following unique 3-stars in the graph:
  <0, (2, 8, _)>
  <2, (0, 3, 8)>
  <3, (1, 2, 4)>
  <3, (2, 4, 6)>
  <3, (4, 5, _)>
  <5, (4, 8, _)>
  <6, (3, 7, 9)>
  <8, (0, 2, 5)>
  <8, (2, 3, 7)>
  <9, (2, 6, _)>

Step 3: Provide the final answer in brackets.
- The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
