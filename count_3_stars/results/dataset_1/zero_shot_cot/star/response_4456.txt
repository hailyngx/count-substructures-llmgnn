Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0: <0, (4, 9, 1)>
2. Node 1: <1, (9, 0, 4)>
3. Node 2: <2, (4, 0, 5)>
4. Node 3: <3, (7, 8, 6)>
5. Node 5: <5, (4, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
