Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that can be the center of a 3-star in this graph. For a node to be the center of a 3-star, it should have exactly three edges connected to it. Let's list these nodes:  
- Node 2 (connected to 0, 5, 7, 8, 9)  
- Node 7 (connected to 1, 2, 6, 8, 9)  
- Node 8 (connected to 2, 6, 7)  

Now, let's list the 3-stars in the graph:  
<2, (0, 5, 7)>  
<2, (0, 7, 9)>  
<2, (5, 6, 8)>  
<2, (7, 1, 9)>  
<7, (1, 4, 9)>  
<7, (1, 2, 6)>  
<7, (2, 6, 8)>  
<7, (2, 6, 9)>  
<8, (2, 6, 7)>  

Counting them all, we have a total of [9] unique 3-stars in the graph.
