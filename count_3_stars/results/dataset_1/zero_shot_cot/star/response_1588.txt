Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<8, (0, 4, 5)>
<1, (4, 5, 6)>
<4, (1, 3, 5)>
<5, (1, 2, 3)>
<3, (4, 5, 6)>
<9, (3, 5, 9)>

Therefore, there are [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
