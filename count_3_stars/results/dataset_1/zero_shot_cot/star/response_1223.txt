Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 7) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes of the graph. The 10 nodes are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Now, let's look for the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 0:
   - 3-star: <0, (2, 5, 1)> 

2. Node 1:
   - 3-star: <1, (5, 6, 0)>
   
3. Node 2:
   - 3-star: <2, (0, 8, 5)> 

4. Node 5:
   - 3-star: <5, (0, 1, 2)> 

5. Node 6:
   - 3-star: <6, (1, 4, 9)> 

6. Node 8:
   - 3-star: <8, (2, 9, 0)> 

7. Node 9:
   - 3-star: <9, (6, 8, 4)>

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
