Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. From node 0: (0, 1, 3), (0, 1, 5), (0, 1, 6), (0, 1, 7)
2. From node 1: (1, 0, 3), (1, 0, 5), (1, 0, 6), (1, 0, 7)
3. From node 3: (3, 0, 1), (3, 1, 2)
4. From node 4: (4, 2, 9)
5. From node 5: (5, 0, 1), (5, 0, 7)
6. From node 6: (6, 0, 1), (6, 0, 2)
7. From node 7: (7, 0, 1), (7, 0, 5), (7, 0, 8)
8. From node 8: (8, 1, 7), (8, 1, 9)
9. From node 9: (9, 4, 8)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].  
The unique 3-stars are <0, (1, 3, 5)>, <0, (1, 6, 7)>, <1, (0, 3, 5)>, <1, (0, 6, 7)>, <3, (0, 1, 2)>, <4, (2, 9, 8)>, <5, (0, 1, 7)>, <6, (0, 1, 2)>, <7, (0, 1, 5)>, <7, (0, 1, 8)>, <8, (1, 7, 9)>, <9, (4, 8, 1)>.
