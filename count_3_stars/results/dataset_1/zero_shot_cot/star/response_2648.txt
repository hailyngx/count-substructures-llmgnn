Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to node 0, 1, 2, etc.

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2 and 4.
- Node 1 is connected to node 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0 and 3.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 6, and 7.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 6.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 8, and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to node 3.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1 and 6.
- Node 9 is connected to node 6.

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 4, and 6.
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 3, and 4.
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 4, and 6.
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 3, and 6.
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 4, and 8.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (2, 4, 6)>
- <2, (0, 3, 4)>
- <3, (2, 4, 6)>
- <4, (0, 3, 6)>
- <6, (3, 4, 8)>
