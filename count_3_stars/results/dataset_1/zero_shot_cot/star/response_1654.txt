Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <1, (4, 6, 8)>
2. <2, (4, 9, 7)>
3. <3, (5, 8, 7)>

Therefore, there are [3] 3-stars in the given graph.
