Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify the nodes that are connected to each other.

The nodes and their connections are as follows:
0: 6
1: 2, 3, 9
2: 1, 4, 6, 8
3: 1, 4
4: 2, 3, 8
5: 6, 8
6: 0, 2, 5
8: 2, 4, 5
9: 1

Next, we will identify the 3-stars present in the graph:
<1, (2, 4, 8)>
<2, (1, 4, 8)>
<4, (2, 3, 8)>
<8, (2, 4, 5)>

Now, counting the total number of 3-stars in the graph: [4].
