Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (4, 7, -)>
2. <1, (2, 3, 8)>
3. <1, (8, 9, -)>
4. <2, (1, 8, -)>
5. <3, (1, 5, -)>
6. <5, (3, 7, 8)>
7. <7, (0, 5, -)>
8. <8, (1, 2, 5)>
9. <8, (1, 9, -)>
10. <9, (1, 8, -)>

Therefore, there are 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph.
