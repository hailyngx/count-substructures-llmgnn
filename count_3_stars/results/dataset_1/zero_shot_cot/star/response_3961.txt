Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes (nodes with exactly three neighbors), which are nodes 1 and 6. 

Now let's find the 3-stars centered at node 1. 
Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, and 8. 
Hence, the 3-stars centered at node 1 are: 
<1, (2, 3, 4)>
<1, (2, 3, 8)>

Now let's find the 3-stars centered at node 6. 
Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 5. 
Hence, the 3-star centered at node 6 is: 
<6, (2, 3, 5)>

Therefore, there are a total of [3] 3-stars in the given graph.
