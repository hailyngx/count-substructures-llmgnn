Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

The center nodes are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9

For each center node:
- For center node 0: 
    - Leaves are: 3, 8
- For center node 1:
    - Leaves are: 2, 4, 8, 9
- For center node 2:
    - Leaves are: 1, 4, 6
- For center node 3:
    - Leaves are: 0
- For center node 4:
    - Leaves are: 1, 2, 6, 8, 9
- For center node 6:
    - Leaves are: 2, 4
- For center node 8:
    - Leaves are: 0, 1, 4, 7
- For center node 9:
    - Leaves are: 1, 4

Combining all the information:
<0, (3, 8)>, <1, (2, 4, 8, 9)>, <2, (1, 4, 6)>, <4, (1, 2, 6, 8, 9)> 

Count of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
