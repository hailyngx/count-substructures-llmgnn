Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
Let's first list all the nodes with their adjacent nodes:

Node 0: 1, 4, 5
Node 1: 0, 3, 6
Node 2: 3, 6
Node 3: 1, 2, 8, 9
Node 4: 0, 8
Node 5: 0
Node 6: 1, 2, 8
Node 8: 3, 4, 6
Node 9: 3

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<1, (0, 3, 6)>
<3, (1, 2, 8)>
<8, (3, 4, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
