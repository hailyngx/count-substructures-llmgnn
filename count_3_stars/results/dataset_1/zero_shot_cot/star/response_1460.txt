Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph step-by-step:

1. Node 0 has edges with nodes 1, 5, and 7. Based on the definition of a 3-star graph, node 0 forms a 3-star <0, (1, 5, 7)>.

2. Node 1 has edges with nodes 0, 2, and 5. Node 1 also forms a 3-star <1, (0, 2, 5)>.

3. Node 2 has edges with nodes 1, 3, and 8. Node 2 forms a 3-star <2, (1, 3, 8)>.

4. Node 3 has edges with nodes 2 and 7. However, it does not form a 3-star because it does not have exactly three connections.

5. Node 4 has an edge with node 6 only, so it does not form a 3-star.

6. Node 5 already forms a 3-star with node 0, so we don't need to consider it again.

7. Node 6 has edges with nodes 4, 5, and 8. Node 6 forms a 3-star <6, (4, 5, 8)>.

8. Node 7 forms a 3-star with node 0, so we don't need to consider it.

9. Node 8 has edges with nodes 2, 6, and 9. Thus, node 8 forms a 3-star <8, (2, 6, 9)>.

10. Node 9 is connected to node 8 but does not have any other connections to form a 3-star.

Finally, counting the unique 3-stars found, we have:
