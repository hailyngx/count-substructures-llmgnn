Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find all the 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through the nodes one by one:

- Node 0 has 5 connections: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 7), (0, 8), forming 1 possible 3-star <0, (1, 3, 4)>.

- Node 1 has 5 connections: (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 9), forming 1 possible 3-star <1, (0, 2, 5)>.

- Node 2 has 2 connections: (2, 1), (2, 6), which is not enough to form a 3-star.

- Node 3 has 4 connections: (3, 0), (3, 4), (3, 6), (3, 8), forming 1 possible 3-star <3, (0, 4, 6)>.

- Node 4 has 3 connections: (4, 0), (4, 3), (4, 8), forming 1 possible 3-star <4, (0, 3, 8)>.

- Node 5 has 4 connections: (5, 1), (5, 6), (5, 8), (5, 9), forming 1 possible 3-star <5, (1, 6, 8)>.

- Node 6 has 6 connections: (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 5), (6, 7), (6, 8), forming 1 possible 3-star <6, (1, 2, 3)>.

- Node 7 has 2 connections: (7, 0), (7, 6), which is not enough to form a 3-star.

- Node 8 has 5 connections: (8, 0), (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 5), (8, 6), forming 1 possible 3-star <8, (0, 3, 4)>.

- Node 9 has 3 connections: (9, 1), (9, 5), (9, 6), forming 1 possible 3-star <9, (1, 5, 6)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6]. 
The unique 3-stars are <0, (1, 3, 4)>, <1, (0, 2, 5)>, <3, (0, 4, 6)>, <4, (0, 3, 8)>, <5, (1, 6, 8)>, and <9, (1, 5, 6)>.
