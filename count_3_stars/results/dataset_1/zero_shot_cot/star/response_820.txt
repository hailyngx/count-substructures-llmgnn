Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify the nodes with exactly three neighbors.
    - Node 1 has neighbors 3, 6, and 6 (3 neighbors).
    - Node 2 has neighbors 5, 6, and 7 (3 neighbors).
    - Node 3 has neighbors 1, 4, and 9 (3 neighbors).
    - Node 4 has neighbors 3, 5, and 8 (3 neighbors).
    - Node 5 has neighbors 2, 4, and 6 (3 neighbors).
    - Node 6 has neighbors 1, 2, and 5 (3 neighbors).

Step 2: Count the number of 3-stars.

Unique 3-stars:
<1, (3, 6, 6)>
<2, (5, 6, 7)>
<3, (1, 4, 9)>
<4, (3, 5, 8)>
<5, (2, 4, 6)>
<6, (1, 2, 5)>
