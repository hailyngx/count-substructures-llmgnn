Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star. Let's start by listing all the 3-stars found in the graph:

<1, (2, 3, 9)>
<2, (1, 4, 6)>
<3, (1, 5, 9)>
<4, (2, 7, 9)>
<5, (3, 7, 8)>
<6, (2, 8, 2)>
<7, (2, 4, 5)>
<8, (2, 5, 6)>
<9, (1, 2, 3)>
<9, (1, 4, 7)>
<9, (1, 7, 8)>

The number of unique 3-stars in the given graph is [11].
