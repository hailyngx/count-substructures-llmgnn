Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0: (0, 3, 8)
2. Node 1: (1, 3, 5)
3. Node 3: (3, 0, 8) and (3, 1, 9)
4. Node 5: (5, 1, 7)
5. Node 7: (7, 1, 5)
6. Node 8: (8, 0, 4)

Next, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph. 

7 unique 3-stars are found in the given graph. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 8, 0)>, <1, (3, 5, 1)>, <3, (0, 8, 3)>, <3, (1, 9, 3)>, <5, (1, 7, 5)>, <7, (1, 5, 7)>, <8, (0, 4, 8)>.
