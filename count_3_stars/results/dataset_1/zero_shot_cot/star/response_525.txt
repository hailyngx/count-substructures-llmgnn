Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes can potentially be the centers of 3-stars.

Nodes with 3 connections: 1, 2, 5, 9

Next, let's check each potential center node with their connected nodes to confirm if they form 3-stars:

1. Node 1: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7)
   - <1, (3, 6, 7)>

2. Node 2: (2, 9)
   - <2, (9, 0, 0)>

3. Node 5: (5, 0) (5, 7)
   - <5, (0, 7, 0)>

4. Node 9: (9, 0) (9, 2)
   - <9, (0, 2, 0)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4]. 
The unique 3-stars found are <1, (3, 6, 7)>, <2, (9, 0, 0)>, <5, (0, 7, 0)>, and <9, (0, 2, 0)>.
