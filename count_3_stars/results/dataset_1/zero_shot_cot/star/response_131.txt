Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique arrangements where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Let's list down the 3-stars we can find in this graph:

<0, (1, 2, 6)>
<1, (0, 6, 8)>
<2, (0, 8, 4)>
<4, (5, 7, 8)>
<5, (4, 8, 9)>
<6, (1, 7, 0)>
<7, (4, 6, 0)>
<8, (2, 4, 5)>
<9, (4, 5, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
