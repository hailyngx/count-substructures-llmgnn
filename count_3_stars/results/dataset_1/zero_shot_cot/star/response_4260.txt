Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
Let's first identify the central nodes in the graph. The central node in a 3-star graph will have degree 3 (connected to exactly three other nodes).

From the given edges:
- Node 1 has degree 4
- Node 2 has degree 5
- Node 3 has degree 2
- Node 4 has degree 2
- Node 5 has degree 4
- Node 6 has degree 2
- Node 7 has degree 5
- Node 8 has degree 1
- Node 9 has degree 4

So, the central nodes are nodes 2 and 7.

Now, let's identify the leaves connected to each central node.

For central node 2:
- Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9 are connected to node 2.
- Possible 3-star formations involving node 2:
  - <2, (6, 7, 8)>
  - <2, (6, 7, 9)>
  - <2, (7, 8, 9)>

For central node 7:
- Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 5 are connected to node 7.
- Possible 3-star formations involving node 7:
  - <7, (1, 2, 5)>
  - <7, (1, 2, 3)>
  - <7, (1, 2, 7)>
  - <7, (1, 5, 7)>
  - <7, (2, 3, 5)>
  - <7, (2, 3, 7)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 6.

Therefore, the final answer is [6].

Unique 3-stars:
<2, (6, 7, 8)>
<2, (6, 7, 9)>
<2, (7, 8, 9)>
<7, (1, 2, 5)>
<7, (1, 2, 3)>
<7, (1, 5, 7)>
