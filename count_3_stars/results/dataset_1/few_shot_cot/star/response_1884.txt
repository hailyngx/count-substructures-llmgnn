Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 6, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-stars: <0, (1, 3, 6)>, <0, (1, 3, 8)>, <0, (1, 6, 8)>, <0, (3, 6, 8)>
  
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
  - 3-stars: <1, (0, 2, 3)>, <1, (0, 2, 4)>, <1, (0, 2, 5)>, <1, (0, 2, 7)>, <1, (0, 3, 4)>, <1, (0, 3, 5)>, <1, (0, 3, 7)>, <1, (0, 4, 5)>, <1, (0, 4, 7)>, <1, (0, 5, 7)>, <1, (2, 3, 4)>, <1, (2, 3, 5)>, <1, (2, 3, 7)>, <1, (2, 4, 5)>, <1, (2, 4, 7)>, <1, (2, 5, 7)>, <1, (3, 4, 5)>, <1, (3, 4, 7)>, <1, (3, 5, 7)>, <1, (4, 5, 7)>
  
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 6, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-stars: <2, (1, 6, 9)>
  
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-stars: <3, (0, 1, 8)>
  
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 6, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-stars: <4, (1, 6, 8)>
  
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 4, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-stars: <6, (0, 2, 4)>, <6, (0, 2, 7)>, <6, (0, 4, 7)>, <6, (2, 4, 7)>
  
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-stars: <8, (0, 3, 4)>
  
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 20
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 8: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 20 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 32

Therefore, there are a total of [32] 3-stars in your graph.
