Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, and node 8

Response:
Given the adjacency list provided, we'll identify the number of 3-star configurations centered around each node with at least three neighbors. 

Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 5, 8, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {7, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 5, 6, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 5, 6, 8, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {6, 7, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 3, 6, 7, 9} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 3, 6, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 5: 20
- From Node 6: 20
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 20

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 20 + 10 + 20 = 94

Therefore, there are a total of [94] 3-stars in your graph.
