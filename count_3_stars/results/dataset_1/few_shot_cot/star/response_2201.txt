Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {3, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {7, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = 1
  - 3-star: <2, (4, 6, 7)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {2, 7, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = 1
  - 3-star: <4, (2, 7, 8)>
- **Node 5**: Not connected to any other nodes.
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = 1
  - 3-star: <7, (1, 2, 4)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = 1
  - 3-star: <8, (1, 4, 9)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = 1
  - 3-star: <9, (0, 3, 8)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5

Therefore, there are a total of [5] 3-stars in your graph.
