Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 5, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-Stars: <0, (1, 5, 6)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
  - 3-Stars: <1, (0, 5, 6)>, <1, (0, 6, 7)>, <1, (2, 5, 6)>, <1, (2, 6, 7)>, <1, (3, 6, 7)>, <1, (5, 6, 7)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 5, 6, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - 3-Stars: <2, (1, 5, 6)>, <2, (1, 6, 7)>, <2, (4, 5, 6)>, <2, (4, 6, 7)>, <2, (5, 6, 7)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 6, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-Stars: <3, (1, 6, 7)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2, 7, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - 3-Stars: <5, (0, 1, 7)>, <5, (0, 2, 7)>, <5, (0, 5, 8)>, <5, (1, 2, 7)>, <5, (1, 7, 6)>, <5, (2, 7, 6)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2, 3, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - 3-Stars: <6, (0, 1, 7)>, <6, (0, 2, 7)>, <6, (1, 2, 7)>, <6, (1, 7, 6)>, <6, (2, 7, 6)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3, 5, 6} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - 3-Stars: <7, (1, 2, 6)>, <7, (1, 3, 6)>, <7, (1, 5, 6)>, <7, (2, 3, 6)>, <7, (2, 5, 6)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
  
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 20
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 7: 10
Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 20 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 62

Therefore, there are a total of [62] 3-stars in your graph.
