Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: No neighbors, cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {6, 7} (2 neighbors), cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 8} (2 neighbors), cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {6, 7} (2 neighbors), cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor), cannot form a 3-star.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5

Therefore, there are a total of [5] 3-stars in your graph.
