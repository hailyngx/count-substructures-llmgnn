Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 8

Node 2 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, and node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {6, 7, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - 3-Star: <0, (6, 7, 8)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - 3-Stars: <1, (4, 6, 8)>, <1, (4, 6, 9)>, <1, (4, 8, 9)>, <1, (6, 8, 9)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {6, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 6, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - 3-Stars: <4, (1, 6, 9)>, <4, (1, 8, 9)>, <4, (3, 6, 9)>, <4, (6, 8, 9)>
- **Node 5**: Not connected to any other nodes.
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2, 4, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - 3-Stars: <6, (0, 1, 9)>, <6, (0, 4, 9)>, <6, (1, 4, 9)>, <6, (1, 8, 9)>, <6, (2, 4, 9)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 3, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - 3-Stars: <7, (0, 2, 9)>, <7, (0, 3, 9)>, <7, (2, 3, 9)>, <7, (2, 6, 9)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 1} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 6, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - 3-Stars: <9, (1, 4, 6)>, <9, (1, 4, 7)>, <9, (1, 6, 7)>, <9, (4, 6, 7)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 27

Therefore, there are a total of [27] 3-stars in your graph.
