Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 7, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - <1, (2, 8, 9)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 7, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - <2, (1, 7, 9)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 6, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - <3, (2, 6, 9)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {3, 6, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {6} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 5, 8, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{5}{3} = 10\)
    - <6, (3, 4, 9)> <6, (3, 8, 9)> <6, (4, 8, 9)> <6, (3, 4, 8)> <6, (3, 4, 6)> <6, (3, 6, 8)> <6, (4, 6, 8)> <6, (4, 6, 9)> <6, (4, 8, 9)> <6, (3, 8, 4)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - <7, (1, 8, 9)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 6, 7, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{5}{3} = 10\)
    - <8, (1, 6, 9)> <8, (1, 7, 9)> <8, (6, 7, 9)> <8, (4, 6, 9)> <8, (4, 7, 9)> <8, (4, 6, 7)> <8, (1, 4, 7)> <8, (1, 4, 6)> <8, (1, 4, 9)> <8, (4, 6, 7)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{6}{3} = 20\)
    - <9, (1, 2, 8)> <9, (1, 2, 7)> <9, (1, 2, 9)> <9, (1, 8, 7)> <9, (1, 8, 9)> <9, (1, 7, 9)> <9, (2, 7, 8)> <9, (2, 8, 9)> <9, (2, 7, 9)> <9, (7, 8, 9)> <9, (3, 6, 8)> <9, (3, 6, 7)> <9, (3, 6, 9)> <9, (3, 8, 7)> <9, (3, 8, 9)> <9, (3, 7, 9)> <9, (6, 7, 8)> <9, (6, 8, 9)> <9, (6, 7, 9)> <9, (7, 8, 9)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 20

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 20 = 44

Therefore, there are a total of [44] 3-stars in your graph.
