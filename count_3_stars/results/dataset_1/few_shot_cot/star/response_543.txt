Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 4, 7, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 5, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - Possible 3-stars: <0, (1, 2, 5)>, <0, (1, 2, 7)>, <0, (1, 5, 7)>, <0, (2, 5, 7)>
  
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - Possible 3-star: <3, (2, 5, 6)>
  
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {6, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - Possible 3-star: <4, (6, 8, 9)>
  
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - Possible 3-star: <6, (3, 4, 7)>
  
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 6, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - Possible 3-star: <7, (0, 6, 9)>
  
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 7, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - Possible 3-stars: <9, (1, 4, 7)>, <9, (1, 4, 8)>, <9, (1, 7, 8)>, <9, (4, 7, 8)>
  
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 9: 4
Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 12
Therefore, there are a total of [12] 3-stars in your graph.
