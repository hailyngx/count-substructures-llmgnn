Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <1, (2, 3, 6)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 6, 7, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <2, (1, 7, 8)>, <2, (6, 7, 8)>, <2, (1, 6, 7)>, <2, (1, 6, 8)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 5, 6, 7, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - <3, (1, 5, 6)>, <3, (1, 6, 7)>, <3, (1, 6, 9)>, <3, (5, 6, 9)>, <3, (6, 7, 9)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {6} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <5, (0, 8, 9)>, <5, (3, 8, 9)>, <5, (0, 3, 8)>, <5, (0, 3, 9)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
  - <6, (1, 3, 9)>, <6, (1, 4, 9)>, <6, (1, 8, 9)>, <6, (2, 3, 9)>, <6, (2, 8, 9)>, <6, (3, 8, 9)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <7, (2, 3, 8)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 5, 6, 7, 9} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
  - <8, (0, 5, 9)>, <8, (0, 6, 9)>, <8, (2, 5, 9)>, <8, (2, 7, 9)>, <8, (5, 6, 9)>, <8, (6, 7, 9)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 6, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <9, (3, 5, 8)>, <9, (3, 6, 8)>, <9, (5, 6, 8)>, <9, (3, 5, 6)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 20
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 20
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 1 + 20 + 4 = 64

Therefore, there are a total of [64] 3-stars in your graph.
