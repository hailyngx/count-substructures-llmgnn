Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 7, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 6, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {3, 6, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 3, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 15

Therefore, there are a total of [15] 3-stars in your graph.
