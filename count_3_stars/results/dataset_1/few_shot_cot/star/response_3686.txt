Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 4, 7, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {6, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {6, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {6, 7, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 4, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2, 6, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 7, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 10
Therefore, there are a total of [10] 3-stars in your graph.
