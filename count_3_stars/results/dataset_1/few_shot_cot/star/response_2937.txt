Node 9 is connected to node 1, 4, 7, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list provided, we'll analyze each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 6, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Possible 3-stars:
    - <1, (0, 3, 6)>
    - <1, (0, 3, 9)>
    - <1, (0, 6, 9)>
    - <1, (3, 6, 9)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Possible 3-star:
    - <6, (1, 3, 8)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Possible 3-star:
    - <7, (4, 5, 9)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2, 6, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Possible 3-star:
    - <8, (2, 6, 9)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 7, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Possible 3-stars:
    - <9, (1, 4, 7)>
    - <9, (1, 4, 8)>
    - <9, (1, 7, 8)>
    - <9, (4, 7, 8)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 11

Therefore, there are a total of [11] 3-stars in your graph.
