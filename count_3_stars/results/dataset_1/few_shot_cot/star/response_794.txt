Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 6

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 6, 7, 8, 9} (5 neighbors)
   Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 4, 6, 7} (5 neighbors)
   Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {9} (1 neighbor)
   Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 5} (2 neighbors)
   Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 5} (2 neighbors)
   Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {3, 4} (2 neighbors)
   Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
   Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 1} (2 neighbors)
   Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 6} (2 neighbors)
   Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 6} (3 neighbors)
   Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 25

Therefore, there are total of [25] 3-stars in your graph.
