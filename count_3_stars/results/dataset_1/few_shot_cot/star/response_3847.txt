Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 6

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 7, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - <1, (3, 7, 9)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3, 7, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - <2, (3, 7, 8)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 5, 6, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - <3, (1, 2, 5)>, <3, (1, 2, 6)>, <3, (1, 2, 7)>, <3, (1, 5, 6)>, <3, (1, 5, 7)>, <3, (1, 6, 7)>, <3, (2, 5, 6)>, <3, (2, 5, 7)>, <3, (2, 6, 7)>, <3, (5, 6, 7)>
- **Node 4**: Not connected to any other nodes.
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - <5, (0, 3, 9)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {3, 7, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - <6, (3, 7, 8)>, <6, (3, 7, 9)>, <6, (3, 8, 9)>, <6, (7, 8, 9)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - <7, (1, 2, 3)>, <7, (1, 2, 6)>, <7, (1, 3, 6)>, <7, (2, 3, 6)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 5, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - <9, (1, 5, 6)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Total number of 3-stars = 1 (from Node 1) + 1 (from Node 2) + 10 (from Node 3) + 1 (from Node 5) + 4 (from Node 6) + 4 (from Node 7) + 1 (from Node 9) = 22

Therefore, there are a total of [22] 3-stars in your graph.
