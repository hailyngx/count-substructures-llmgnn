Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 1

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {3, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 5, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <2, (1, 3, 5)> 
  - <2, (1, 3, 6)>
  - <2, (1, 5, 6)>
  - <2, (3, 5, 6)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 4, 5, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - <3, (0, 2, 8)>
  - <3, (0, 4, 8)>
  - <3, (2, 4, 8)>
  - <3, (2, 5, 8)>
  - <3, (4, 5, 8)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {3, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <5, (2, 3, 8)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {2, 7, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <6, (2, 7, 8)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {6, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 5, 6, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - <8, (3, 4, 7)>
  - <8, (3, 5, 7)>
  - <8, (3, 6, 7)>
  - <8, (4, 5, 7)>
  - <8, (4, 6, 7)>
  - <8, (5, 6, 7)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 1} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 8: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 26

Therefore, there are a total of [26] 3-stars in your graph.
