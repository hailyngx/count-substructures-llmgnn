Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 1} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {6} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 7, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 20
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 30

Therefore, there are a total of [30] 3-stars in the given graph.
