Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 6, 7, 8, 9} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\) <0, (1, 8, 9)>, <0, (2, 6, 9)>, <0, (6, 7, 9)>, <0, (6, 8, 9)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 6, 8, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) <1, (0, 6, 9)>, <1, (0, 8, 9)>, <1, (3, 6, 8)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 6, 7, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) <2, (0, 6, 8)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 5, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 6, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) <5, (3, 4, 6)>, <5, (3, 4, 7)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2, 5, 8, 9} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\) <6, (0, 1, 9)>, <6, (0, 2, 9)>, <6, (1, 3, 8)>, <6, (1, 9, 0)>, <6, (8, 0, 1)>, <6, (8, 1, 3)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 4, 5} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) <7, (0, 4, 5)>, <7, (0, 5, 6)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2, 3, 6} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) <8, (0, 1, 6)>, <8, (0, 3, 6)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 4, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) <9, (0, 1, 6)>, <9, (0, 4, 6)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 20
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 20
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 78

Therefore, there are a total of [78] 3-stars in the given graph.
