Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <2, (0, 1, 8)>, <2, (0, 1, 9)>, <2, (0, 8, 9)>, <2, (1, 8, 9)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {6, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-star: <3, (6, 8, 9)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {4, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-star: <6, (3, 5, 7)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 6, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <7, (1, 4, 6)>, <7, (1, 4, 9)>, <7, (1, 6, 9)>, <7, (4, 6, 9)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-star: <8, (0, 2, 3)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-star: <9, (2, 3, 7)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 12
Therefore, there are a total of [12] 3-stars in your graph.
