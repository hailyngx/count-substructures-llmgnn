Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 6
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <1, (4, 5, 6)>
- **Node 2**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 6, 7, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - <3, (4, 5, 6)>, <3, (4, 5, 7)>, <3, (4, 5, 8)>, <3, (4, 6, 7)>, <3, (4, 6, 8)>, <3, (4, 7, 8)>, <3, (5, 6, 7)>, <3, (5, 6, 8)>, <3, (5, 7, 8)>, <3, (6, 7, 8)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <4, (1, 3, 7)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 3, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <5, (0, 1, 3)>, <5, (0, 1, 6)>, <5, (0, 3, 6)>, <5, (1, 3, 6)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <6, (1, 3, 5)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <7, (0, 3, 4)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {3, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 18

Therefore, there are a total of [18] 3-stars in your graph.
