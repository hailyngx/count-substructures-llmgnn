Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (5, 3) (5, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 2

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: No neighbors.
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {9} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3, 7, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: No neighbors.
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {3, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: No neighbors.
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 2} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 7: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 = 5
Therefore, there are a total of [5] 3-stars in your graph.
