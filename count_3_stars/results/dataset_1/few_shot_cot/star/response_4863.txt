Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 6

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {3} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: No neighbors
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 6, 9} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 4**: No neighbors
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {3, 9} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2, 5} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: No neighbors
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {3, 6} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 3: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1

Therefore, there are a total of [1] 3-stars in your graph.
