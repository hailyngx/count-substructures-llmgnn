Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 6
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 2
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-star: <2, (4, 5, 6)>
- **Node 3**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-star: <4, (1, 2, 5)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-star: <5, (0, 2, 4)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 8**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 9**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Adding up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3

Therefore, there are a total of [3] 3-stars in your graph.
