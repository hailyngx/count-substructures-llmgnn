Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 5

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 4, 6, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 1**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 7, 8, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 6, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 4, 5} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 2: 20
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 20 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 51

Therefore, there are a total of [51] 3-stars in your graph.
