Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 5

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <1, (5, 8, 9)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 6, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <2, (4, 5, 6)>, <2, (4, 5, 9)>, <2, (4, 6, 9)>, <2, (5, 6, 9)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {2, 6, 7, 8, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - <4, (2, 6, 7)>, <4, (2, 6, 8)>, <4, (2, 6, 9)>, <4, (2, 7, 8)>, <4, (2, 7, 9)>, <4, (2, 8, 9)>, <4, (6, 7, 8)>, <4, (6, 7, 9)>, <4, (6, 8, 9)>, <4, (7, 8, 9)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <5, (1, 2, 9)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <6, (2, 4, 7)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <7, (4, 6, 8)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 4, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <8, (1, 3, 4)>, <8, (1, 3, 7)>, <8, (1, 4, 7)>, <8, (3, 4, 7)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 4, 5} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <9, (1, 2, 4)>, <9, (1, 2, 5)>, <9, (1, 4, 5)>, <9, (2, 4, 5)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 26 

Therefore, there are a total of [26] 3-stars in your graph.
