Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 8
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 5, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 4, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 5, 6, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 20
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 20 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 35

Therefore, there are a total of [35] 3-stars in your graph.
