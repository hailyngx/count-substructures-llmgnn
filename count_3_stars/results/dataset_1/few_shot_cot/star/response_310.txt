Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - Unique 3-stars: <0, (5, 8, 9)>

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - Unique 3-stars: <1, (2, 3, 4)>

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 5, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - Unique 3-stars: <2, (1, 4, 5)>, <2, (1, 4, 9)>, <2, (1, 5, 9)>, <2, (4, 5, 9)>

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 2} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - Unique 3-stars: <5, (0, 2, 7)>

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 6, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - Unique 3-stars: <8, (0, 6, 9)>

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - Unique 3-stars: <9, (0, 2, 8)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Adding up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 9

Therefore, there are a total of [9] 3-stars in your graph.
