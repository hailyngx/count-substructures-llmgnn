Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 8) (2, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 1) (6, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 2

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 6, 9} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 5, 8} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {8, 9} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: No neighbors
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 7} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 8} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 7} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 2} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 8: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6

Therefore, there are a total of [6] 3-stars in your graph.
