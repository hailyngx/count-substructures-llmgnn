Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of the total number of 3-stars in the given graph:

- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-star: <0, (1, 3, 8)>

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-star: <1, (0, 8, 9)>

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 6, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <2, (4, 5, 6)>, <2, (4, 5, 9)>, <2, (4, 6, 9)>, <2, (5, 6, 9)>

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {2, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 7, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <5, (2, 4, 7)>, <5, (2, 4, 8)>, <5, (2, 7, 8)>, <5, (4, 7, 8)>

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {2, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 5, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <8, (0, 1, 5)>, <8, (0, 5, 9)>, <8, (1, 5, 9)>, <8, (0, 1, 9)>

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 6, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <9, (1, 2, 6)>, <9, (1, 2, 8)>, <9, (1, 6, 8)>, <9, (2, 6, 8)>

Summing up the total number of 3-stars:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 18

Therefore, there are a total of [18] 3-stars in the given graph.
