Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 4
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 6} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {6, 8} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {7, 8} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 8} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - <4, (5, 6, 8)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 4, 7} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - <5, (0, 4, 7)>, <5, (1, 4, 7)>, <5, (0, 6, 7)>, <5, (1, 6, 7)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 4} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - <6, (0, 4, 8)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {3, 5} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 4} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - <8, (2, 3, 4)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 8: 1

Total number of all 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 7
Therefore, there are a total of [7] 3-stars in your graph.
