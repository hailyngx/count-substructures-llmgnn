Node 7 is connected to node 1, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 7

Response:
Calculating the number of 3-stars in the provided graph:

- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 4, 6, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
  - 3-Stars from Node 1: <1, (0, 2, 4)>, <1, (0, 4, 6)>, <1, (0, 4, 7)>, <1, (2, 4, 6)>, <1, (2, 4, 7)>, <1, (4, 6, 7)>, <1, (0, 2, 6)>, <1, (0, 2, 7)>, <1, (0, 6, 7)>, <1, (2, 6, 7)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 6, 8, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
  - 3-Stars from Node 4: <4, (0, 1, 6)>, <4, (0, 1, 8)>, <4, (0, 1, 9)>, <4, (0, 6, 8)>, <4, (0, 6, 9)>, <4, (0, 8, 9)>, <4, (1, 6, 8)>, <4, (1, 6, 9)>, <4, (1, 8, 9)>, <4, (6, 8, 9)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 7, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - 3-Stars from Node 5: <5, (2, 3, 7)>, <5, (2, 3, 9)>, <5, (2, 7, 9)>, <5, (3, 7, 9)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 5, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - 3-Stars from Node 7: <7, (1, 5, 8)>, <7, (1, 5, 9)>, <7, (1, 8, 9)>, <7, (5, 8, 9)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - 3-Stars from Node 9: <9, (4, 5, 7)>

Summing up the total number of 3-stars:
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 29

Therefore, there are a total of [29] 3-stars in your graph.
