Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 4, 6, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - 3-Stars: <0, (2, 4, 6)>, <0, (3, 4, 6)>, <0, (4, 6, 7)>, <0, (2, 6, 7)>, <0, (2, 3, 7)>

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {6} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 6, 7, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - 3-Stars: <2, (0, 6, 7)>, <2, (0, 6, 8)>, <2, (6, 7, 8)>, <2, (7, 8, 0)>

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 5, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \)

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 6, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - 3-Stars: <4, (0, 6, 8)>, <4, (0, 6, 9)>, <4, (0, 8, 9)>, <4, (6, 8, 9)>

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {3} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2, 4, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - 3-Stars: <6, (0, 2, 4)>, <6, (0, 4, 8)>, <6, (0, 2, 8)>, <6, (2, 4, 8)>, <6, (4, 8, 0)>, <6, (4, 8, 9)>, <6, (0, 8, 9)>, <6, (2, 8, 9)>, <6, (2, 4, 9)>, <6, (0, 4, 9)>

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 3, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - 3-Stars: <7, (0, 2, 3)>, <7, (0, 3, 8)>, <7, (2, 3, 8)>, <7, (0, 2, 8)>

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 6, 7, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - 3-Stars: <8, (2, 4, 6)>, <8, (2, 4, 9)>, <8, (2, 6, 7)>, <8, (2, 6, 9)>, <8, (4, 6, 9)>, <8, (4, 8, 9)>, <8, (6, 7, 9)>, <8, (6, 8, 9)>, <8, (2, 7, 9)>, <8, (4, 7, 9)>

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {4, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 5
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 5 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 38

Therefore, there are a total of [38] 3-stars in your graph.
