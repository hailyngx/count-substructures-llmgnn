Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 8} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: No neighbors
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 4**: No neighbors
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 3} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {3} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {9} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 3} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {3, 7} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 5: 1
Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 = 5
Therefore, there are a total of [5] 3-stars in your graph.
