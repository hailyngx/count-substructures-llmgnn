Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 5

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4, 6} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 6} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: No neighbors
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 9} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
    - <3, (4, 6, 9)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 3, 5, 8} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    - <4, (0, 1, 8)>, <4, (0, 3, 8)>, <4, (1, 3, 8)>, <4, (0, 5, 8)>, <4, (1, 5, 8)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {4, 9} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 3, 8} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - <6, (0, 1, 8)>, <6, (0, 3, 8)>, <6, (1, 3, 8)>, <6, (0, 8, 1)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 7} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
    - <8, (4, 6, 7)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {3, 5} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 8: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 16

Therefore, there are a total of [16] 3-stars in your graph.
