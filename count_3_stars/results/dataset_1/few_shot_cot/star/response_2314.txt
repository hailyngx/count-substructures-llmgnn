Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 6} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 5} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 5, 6, 7} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 8} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 6} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 5, 7} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2, 6, 8} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4, 7} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: No neighbors
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 18

Therefore, there are a total of [18] 3-stars in your graph.
