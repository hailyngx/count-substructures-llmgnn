Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 4} (2 neighbors)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 5} (2 neighbors)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 8} (3 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  Unique 3-stars: <2, (0, 3, 8)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2, 6, 9} (3 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  Unique 3-stars: <3, (2, 6, 9)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 1} (2 neighbors)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1} (1 neighbor)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {3, 7} (2 neighbors)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {6} (1 neighbor)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2, 9} (2 neighbors)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {3, 8} (2 neighbors)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Total number of 3-stars = 1 (from Node 2) + 1 (from Node 3) = 2

Therefore, there are a total of [2] 3-stars in your graph.
