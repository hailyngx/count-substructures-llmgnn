Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - **<0, (1, 4, 8)>**
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 6, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - **<1, (0, 6, 8)>, <1, (0, 8, 9)>, <1, (6, 8, 9)>, <1, (0, 6, 9)>**
- **Node 2**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - **<3, (4, 6, 8)>**
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 7, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - **<4, (0, 3, 7)>, <4, (0, 3, 9)>, <4, (0, 7, 9)>, <4, (3, 7, 9)>**
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - **<6, (1, 3, 8)>**
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - **<7, (4, 5, 9)>**
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 3, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - **<8, (0, 1, 3)>, <8, (0, 1, 6)>, <8, (0, 3, 6)>, <8, (1, 3, 6)>**
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - **<9, (1, 4, 7)>**

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 17

Therefore, there are a total of [17] 3-stars in your graph.
