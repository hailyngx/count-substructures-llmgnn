Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, and node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {6} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {6, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-Stars: <6, (1, 3, 7)>
  
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 6, 8, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - 3-Stars: <7, (0, 6, 9)>, <7, (3, 6, 8)>, <7, (3, 6, 9)>
  
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 10
Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 = 11

Therefore, there are a total of [11] 3-stars in your graph.
