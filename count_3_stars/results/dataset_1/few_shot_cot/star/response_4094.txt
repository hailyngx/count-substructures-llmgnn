Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {9} (1 neighbor)
   - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {9} (1 neighbor)
   - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor)
   - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
   - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {2, 7, 8} (3 neighbors)
   - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
   - <4, (2, 7, 8)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {3, 6} (2 neighbors)
   - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 7} (2 neighbors)
   - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
   - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
   - <7, (4, 8, 9)>, <7, (4, 6, 9)>, <7, (6, 8, 9)>, <7, (4, 6, 8)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4, 7} (2 neighbors)
   - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 7} (3 neighbors)
   - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
   - <9, (0, 1, 7)>
   
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6

Therefore, there are a total of [6] 3-stars in the graph.
