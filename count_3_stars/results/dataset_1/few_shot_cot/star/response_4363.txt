Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, and node 9

Node 7 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 4, and node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {6, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 7, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - 3-stars: <1, (4, 6, 7)>, <1, (4, 6, 9)>, <1, (4, 7, 9)>, <1, (6, 7, 9)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - 3-stars: <2, (3, 8, 9)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - 3-stars: <3, (2, 4, 8)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 6, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - 3-stars: <4, (1, 3, 6)>, <4, (1, 3, 9)>, <4, (1, 6, 9)>, <4, (3, 6, 9)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 4, 7, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
    - 3-stars: <6, (0, 1, 4)>, <6, (0, 1, 7)>, <6, (0, 1, 8)>, <6, (0, 4, 7)>, <6, (0, 4, 8)>, <6, (0, 7, 8)>, <6, (1, 4, 7)>, <6, (1, 4, 8)>, <6, (1, 7, 8)>, <6, (4, 7, 8)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 5, 6, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - 3-stars: <7, (1, 5, 6)>, <7, (1, 5, 9)>, <7, (1, 6, 9)>, <7, (5, 6, 9)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - 3-stars: <8, (2, 3, 6)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2, 4, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
    - 3-stars: <9, (0, 1, 2)>, <9, (0, 1, 4)>, <9, (0, 1, 7)>, <9, (0, 2, 4)>, <9, (0, 2, 7)>, <9, (0, 4, 7)>, <9, (1, 2, 4)>, <9, (1, 2, 7)>, <9, (1, 4, 7)>, <9, (2, 4, 7)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 10 = 35

Therefore, there are a total of [35] 3-stars in your graph.
