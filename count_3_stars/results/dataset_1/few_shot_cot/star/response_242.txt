Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 6, 8} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - Possible 3-star configurations: <0, (3, 5, 8)>, <0, (3, 5, 6)>, <0, (3, 6, 8)>, <0, (5, 6, 8)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 7, 9} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - Possible 3-star configuration: <1, (3, 7, 9)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 8} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - Possible 3-star configuration: <2, (4, 7, 8)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 4, 8, 9} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
    - Possible 3-star configurations: <3, (0, 1, 4)>, <3, (0, 1, 9)>, <3, (0, 4, 8)>, <3, (0, 8, 9)>, <3, (1, 4, 8)>, <3, (1, 4, 9)>, <3, (1, 8, 9)>, <3, (4, 8, 9)>, <3, (0, 4, 9)>, <3, (1, 8, 4)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 7, 8} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - Possible 3-star configurations: <4, (2, 3, 7)>, <4, (2, 3, 8)>, <4, (3, 7, 8)>, <4, (2, 7, 8)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 7, 9} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - Possible 3-star configuration: <5, (0, 7, 9)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 4, 5, 8} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
    - Possible 3-star configurations: <7, (1, 2, 4)>, <7, (1, 4, 5)>, <7, (1, 4, 8)>, <7, (1, 5, 8)>, <7, (2, 4, 8)>, <7, (2, 5, 8)>, <7, (4, 5, 8)>, <7, (1, 5, 4)>, <7, (1, 8, 5)>, <7, (4, 5, 8)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9} (6 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
    - Possible 3-star configurations: <8, (0, 3, 4)>, <8, (0, 3, 9)>, <8, (0, 4, 7)>, <8, (0, 4, 8)>, <8, (0, 7, 9)>, <8, (3, 4, 7)>, <8, (3, 4, 8)>, <8, (3, 7, 9)>, <8, (4, 7, 9)>, <8, (0, 3, 7)>, <8, (0, 7, 8)>, <8, (0, 4, 9)>, <8, (3, 4, 9)>, <8, (3, 8, 9)>, <8, (4, 7, 8)>, <8, (4, 7, 9)>, <8, (7, 4, 8)>, <8, (7, 4, 9)>, <8, (3, 7, 8)>, <8, (3, 7, 4)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 5, 8} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - Possible 3-star configurations: <9, (1, 3, 5)>, <9, (1, 3, 8)>, <9, (1, 5, 8)>, <9, (3, 5, 8)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 20
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 20 + 4 = 55

Therefore, there are a total of [55] 3-stars in your graph.
