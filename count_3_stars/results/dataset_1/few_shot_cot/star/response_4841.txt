Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, 6, and node 7

Response:
Calculating the number of 3-stars in the provided graph by examining each node based on its neighbors:

- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {6, 7, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {6, 7, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 7, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 4, 6, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 5, 6, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 9: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 29

Therefore, there are a total of [29] 3-stars in your graph.
