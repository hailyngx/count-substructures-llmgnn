Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 3

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {3, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = 1 (As it has exactly 3 neighbors)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3, 6, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = 1 (As it has exactly 3 neighbors)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = 1 (As it has exactly 3 neighbors)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = 1 (As it has exactly 3 neighbors)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = 1 (As it has exactly 3 neighbors)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {2, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 4, 5} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 7: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 9

Therefore, there are a total of [9] 3-stars in your graph.
