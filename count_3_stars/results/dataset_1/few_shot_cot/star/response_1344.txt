Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 7

Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 6

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  <0, (4, 6, 7)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 6, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  <1, (2, 4, 6)> <1, (4, 6, 9)> <1, (2, 6, 9)> <1, (2, 4, 9)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  <3, (5, 6, 9)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 5, 7, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  <4, (1, 5, 7)> <4, (0, 5, 7)> <4, (0, 1, 7)> <4, (0, 1, 5)> <4, (1, 5, 8)> <4, (0, 5, 8)> <4, (0, 1, 8)> <4, (0, 8, 5)> <4, (0, 8, 1)> <4, (1, 8, 5)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  <5, (3, 4, 9)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2, 3, 7, 9} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
  <6, (0, 1, 3)> <6, (0, 1, 9)> <6, (0, 2, 3)> <6, (0, 2, 9)> <6, (0, 3, 9)> <6, (1, 2, 3)> <6, (1, 2, 9)> <6, (1, 3, 9)> <6, (2, 3, 9)> <6, (0, 1, 2)> <6, (0, 1, 7)> <6, (0, 2, 7)> <6, (0, 7, 1)> <6, (0, 4, 7)> <6, (0, 4, 6)> <6, (1, 4, 7)> <6, (1, 4, 6)> <6, (4, 6, 9)> <6, (1, 6, 9)> <6, (2, 6, 9)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  <7, (0, 4, 6)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 5, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  <9, (1, 3, 5)> <9, (1, 3, 6)> <9, (1, 5, 6)> <9, (3, 5, 6)>

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 20 + 1 + 4 = 42

Therefore, there are a total of [42] 3-stars in your graph.
