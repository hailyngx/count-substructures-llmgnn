Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 6
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 6

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: No neighbors, cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {6} (1 neighbor), cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 3**: No neighbors, cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {6} (1 neighbor), cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 8} (2 neighbors), cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1} (1 neighbor), cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 5, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 6} (2 neighbors), cannot form a 3-star.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 8: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 1 = 9

Therefore, there are a total of [9] 3-stars in your graph.
