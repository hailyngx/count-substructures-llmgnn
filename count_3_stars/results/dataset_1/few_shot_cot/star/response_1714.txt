Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 1
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 5

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: No neighbors, cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor), cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 6, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <2, (4, 5, 6)>
- **Node 3**: No neighbors, cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {2, 9} (2 neighbors), cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2, 6, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <5, (2, 6, 9)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {2, 5} (2 neighbors), cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1} (1 neighbor), cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 8**: No neighbors, cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <9, (2, 4, 5)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3

Therefore, there are a total of [3] 3-stars in your graph.
