Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 5
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 3

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 6, 7, 9} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 9} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 5, 6, 7} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {4, 7} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 4} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 4, 5} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 8**: No neighbors
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 3} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 7: 4
Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 4 = 24
Therefore, there are a total of [24] 3-stars in your graph.
