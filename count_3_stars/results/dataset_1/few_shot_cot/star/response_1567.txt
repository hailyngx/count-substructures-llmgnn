Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 6

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
        
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {6, 7, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 6, 7, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {3, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 15

Therefore, there are a total of [15] 3-stars in your graph.
