Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 7

Node 4 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 7} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - 3-Star: <0, (2, 5, 7)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 7} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - 3-Star: <2, (0, 4, 7)>
- **Node 3**: Not connected to any other nodes.
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 6} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - 3-Star: <4, (2, 5, 6)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 4, 6, 8} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
    - 3-Stars: <5, (0, 4, 6)>, <5, (0, 4, 8)>, <5, (0, 6, 8)>, <5, (4, 6, 8)>, <5, (6, 8, 9)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - 3-Stars: <6, (4, 5, 8)>, <6, (4, 5, 9)>, <6, (4, 8, 9)>, <6, (5, 8, 9)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 9} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - 3-Star: <7, (0, 2, 9)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 9} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - 3-Star: <8, (5, 6, 9)> 
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {6, 7, 8} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - 3-Star: <9, (6, 7, 8)> 

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 20

Therefore, there are a total of [20] 3-stars in your graph.
