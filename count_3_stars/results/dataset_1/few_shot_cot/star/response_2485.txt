Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 7, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {6} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {6, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - <1, (6, 8, 9)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {6} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - <3, (5, 6, 9)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {9} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {3} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2, 3} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - <6, (0, 1, 3)>, <6, (1, 2, 3)>, <6, (0, 2, 3)>, <6, (0, 1, 2)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {9} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 4, 7, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - <9, (1, 3, 4)>, <9, (1, 3, 7)>, <9, (1, 3, 8)>, <9, (1, 4, 7)>, <9, (1, 4, 8)>, <9, (1, 7, 8)>, <9, (3, 4, 7)>, <9, (3, 4, 8)>, <9, (3, 7, 8)>, <9, (4, 7, 8)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Adding up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 9: 10
Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 16

Therefore, there are a total of [16] 3-stars in your graph.
