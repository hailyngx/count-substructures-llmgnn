Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 7, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2, 7, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 5, 6, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <4, (0, 5, 8)>  <4, (5, 0, 8)>  <4, (6, 0, 8)>  <4, (8, 0, 5)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {3, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 4, 7, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - <8, (2, 3, 9)>  <8, (3, 2, 9)>  <8, (4, 9, 2)>  <8, (7, 2, 9)>  <8, (9, 2, 3)>  <8, (9, 3, 2)>  <8, (7, 3, 9)>  <8, (9, 3, 7)>  <8, (7, 9, 2)>  <8, (9, 7, 2)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {7, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 = 16
Therefore, there are a total of [16] 3-stars in your graph.
