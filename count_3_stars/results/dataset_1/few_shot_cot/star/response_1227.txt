Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list provided, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node as follows:

- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 6, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 4, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 5, 8, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 5, 6, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 4, 6, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 4, 5} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 34

Therefore, there are a total of [34] 3-stars in your graph.
