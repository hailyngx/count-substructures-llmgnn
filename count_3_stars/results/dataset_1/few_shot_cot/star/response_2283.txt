Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {6} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 5, 6, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - <4, (1, 2, 5)>, <4, (1, 2, 6)>, <4, (1, 2, 7)>, <4, (1, 5, 6)>, <4, (1, 5, 7)>, <4, (1, 6, 7)>, <4, (2, 5, 6)>, <4, (2, 5, 7)>, <4, (2, 6, 7)>, <4, (5, 6, 7)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3, 4, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - <6, (1, 2, 3)>, <6, (1, 2, 4)>, <6, (1, 2, 8)>, <6, (1, 3, 4)>, <6, (1, 3, 8)>, <6, (1, 4, 8)>, <6, (2, 3, 4)>, <6, (2, 3, 8)>, <6, (2, 4, 8)>, <6, (3, 4, 8)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 6: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 = 20
Therefore, there are a total of [20] 3-stars in your graph.
