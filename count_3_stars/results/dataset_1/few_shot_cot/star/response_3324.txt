Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 1
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: No neighbors, cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 7, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2, 7, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor), cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1} (1 neighbor), cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 6**: No neighbors, cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 12

Therefore, there are a total of [12] 3-stars in your graph.
