Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 5, and node 6

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {6, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-star: <1, (2, 4, 6)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{6}{3} = 20\)
  - Unique 3-star: <2, (1, 4, 8)>, <2, (1, 4, 5)>, <2, (1, 5, 7)>, <2, (4, 5, 7)>, <2, (4, 5, 8)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 5, 8}  (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-star: <4, (1, 2, 5)>, <4, (1, 5, 8)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 4, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-star: <5, (2, 3, 4)>, <5, (2, 4, 9)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 7, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-star: <6, (1, 7, 9)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-star: <8, (0, 2, 4)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Adding up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 20
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 8: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 34

Therefore, there are a total of [34] 3-stars in your graph.
