Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 5, 6, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
  - The 3-stars involving Node 0: <0, (2, 4, 5)>, <0, (2, 4, 6)>, <0, (2, 4, 8)>, <0, (2, 5, 6)>, <0, (2, 5, 8)>, <0, (2, 6, 8)>, <0, (4, 5, 6)>, <0, (4, 5, 8)>, <0, (4, 6, 8)>, <0, (5, 6, 8)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 7, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - The 3-stars involving Node 1: <1, (4, 6, 7)>, <1, (4, 6, 9)>, <1, (4, 7, 9)>, <1, (6, 7, 9)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - The 3-star involving Node 2: <2, (0, 8, 9)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 6, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - The 3-stars involving Node 3: <3, (4, 5, 6)>, <3, (4, 5, 9)>, <3, (4, 6, 9)>, <3, (5, 6, 9)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - The 3-star involving Node 4: <4, (0, 1, 3)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - The 3-star involving Node 5: <5, (0, 3, 9)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 3, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - The 3-stars involving Node 6: <6, (0, 1, 3)>, <6, (0, 1, 7)>, <6, (0, 3, 7)>, <6, (1, 3, 7)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 2} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3, 5} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - The 3-stars involving Node 9: <9, (1, 3, 5)>, <9, (1, 3, 2)>, <9, (1, 5, 2)>, <9, (3, 5, 2)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 4
Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 25
Therefore, there are a total of [25] 3-stars in your graph.
