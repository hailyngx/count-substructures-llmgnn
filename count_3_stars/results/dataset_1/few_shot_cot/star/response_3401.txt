Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: No neighbors - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor) - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - <2, (5, 6, 7)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 7} (2 neighbors) - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: No neighbors - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - <5, (2, 3, 6)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {2, 5} (2 neighbors) - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2, 3} (2 neighbors) - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 9} (2 neighbors) - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor) - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 = 2

Therefore, there are a total of [2] 3-stars in your graph. The unique 3-stars found are <2, (5, 6, 7)> and <5, (2, 3, 6)>.
