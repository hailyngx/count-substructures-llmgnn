Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 6

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 6, 8, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - Unique 3-stars:
    <0, (1, 6, 8)>, <0, (1, 6, 9)>, <0, (2, 6, 8)>, <0, (2, 6, 9)>, <0, (1, 8, 9)>, <0, (6, 8, 9)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 4, 5} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Unique 3-stars:
    <1, (0, 3, 4)>, <1, (0, 3, 5)>, <1, (0, 4, 5)>, <1, (3, 4, 5)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 6, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Unique 3-star:
    <3, (1, 6, 8)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Unique 3-star:
    <5, (1, 4, 8)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Unique 3-stars:
    <6, (0, 3, 8)>, <6, (0, 3, 9)>, <6, (0, 8, 9)>, <6, (3, 8, 9)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 5, 6, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - Unique 3-stars:
    <8, (0, 5, 6)>, <8, (0, 5, 7)>, <8, (0, 6, 7)>, <8, (5, 6, 7)>, <8, (0, 5, 3)>, <8, (0, 3, 6)>, <8, (0, 3, 7)>, <8, (5, 3, 6)>, <8, (5, 3, 7)>, <8, (3, 6, 7)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 8: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 30

Therefore, there are a total of [30] 3-stars in your graph.
