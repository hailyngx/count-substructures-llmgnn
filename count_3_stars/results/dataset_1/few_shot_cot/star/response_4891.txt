Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 5} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 6} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 5, 8} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - **3-star configurations**:
        - <2, (0, 1, 8)>
        - <2, (0, 5, 8)>
        - <2, (1, 5, 8)>
        - <2, (0, 1, 5)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 8} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 3, 8} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - **3-star configurations**:
        - <5, (0, 2, 8)>
        - <5, (2, 3, 8)>
        - <5, (0, 3, 8)>
        - <5, (0, 2, 3)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 7, 8} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - **3-star configurations**:
        - <6, (1, 7, 8)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - **3-star configurations**:
        - <7, (4, 6, 8)>
        - <7, (4, 8, 9)>
        - <7, (6, 8, 9)>
        - <7, (4, 6, 9)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 5, 6, 7} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
    - **3-star configurations**:
        - <8, (2, 4, 5)>
        - <8, (2, 5, 6)>
        - <8, (2, 5, 7)>
        - <8, (2, 6, 7)>
        - <8, (4, 6, 7)>
        - <8, (4, 7, 9)>
        - <8, (5, 6, 7)>
        - <8, (5, 7, 9)>
        - <8, (6, 7, 9)>
        - <8, (2, 4, 6)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 23

Therefore, there are a total of [23] 3-stars in your graph.
