Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {6} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = ${3 \choose 3} = 1$
  - <4, (7, 8, 9)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = ${3 \choose 3} = 1$
  - <7, (4, 9, 3)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {4, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 7: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 = 2
Therefore, there are a total of [2] 3-stars in your graph.
