Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 6, 7, 9} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 7, 8} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 3**: Not connected to any other nodes.
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 7} (6 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 7} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 5, 7, 8} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9} (7 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{7}{3} = 35\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2, 6, 7} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 7} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 4: 20
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 7: 35
- From Node 8: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 20 + 1 + 10 + 35 + 1 = 81

Therefore, there are a total of [81] 3-stars in your graph.
