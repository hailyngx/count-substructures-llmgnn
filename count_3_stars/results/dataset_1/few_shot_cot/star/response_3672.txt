Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:

- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {7, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-star: <1, (4, 5, 8)>
  
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-star: <2, (3, 5, 8)>
  
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2, 6, 7, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <3, (2, 6, 7)>, <3, (2, 6, 9)>, <3, (2, 7, 9)>, <3, (6, 7, 9)>
  
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 7, 8, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <5, (1, 7, 8)>, <5, (1, 7, 9)>, <5, (1, 8, 9)>, <5, (2, 7, 8)>, <5, (2, 7, 9)>, <5, (2, 8, 9)>, <5, (7, 8, 9)>, <5, (1, 8, 9)>, <5, (1, 9, 5)>, <5, (1, 9, 6)>
  
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {3, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-star: <6, (3, 8, 9)>
  
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-star: <7, (0, 3, 5)>
  
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 5, 6, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <8, (1, 5, 9)>, <8, (1, 6, 9)>, <8, (1, 5, 6)>, <8, (1, 5, 2)>, <8, (1, 6, 2)>, <8, (1, 9, 2)>, <8, (5, 6, 9)>, <8, (5, 6, 2)>, <8, (5, 9, 2)>, <8, (6, 9, 2)>
  
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <9, (0, 3, 5)>, <9, (0, 3, 6)>, <9, (0, 3, 8)>, <9, (0, 4, 5)>, <9, (0, 4, 6)>, <9, (0, 4, 8)>, <9, (0, 5, 6)>, <9, (0, 5, 8)>, <9, (0, 6, 8)>, <9, (3, 5, 6)>, <9, (3, 5, 8)>, <9, (3, 6, 8)>, <9, (4, 5, 6)>, <9, (4, 5, 8)>, <9, (4, 6, 8)>, <9, (5, 6, 8)>, <9, (1, 6, 8)>, <9, (1, 5, 8)>, <9, (1, 5, 6)>, <9, (1, 2, 5)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 20

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 20 = 48

Therefore, there are a total of [48] 3-stars in your graph.
