Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 5

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <0, (1, 4, 6)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 5, 6, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - <1, (0, 4, 6)>, <1, (4, 5, 6)>, <1, (4, 5, 9)>, <1, (5, 6, 9)>, <1, (6, 5, 9)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 6, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <3, (2, 5, 6)>, <3, (2, 5, 9)>, <3, (5, 6, 9)>, <3, (6, 5, 9)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 7, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <4, (0, 1, 7)>, <4, (0, 1, 9)>, <4, (1, 7, 9)>, <4, (7, 9, 5)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 6, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <5, (1, 3, 6)>, <5, (1, 3, 9)>, <5, (1, 6, 9)>, <5, (3, 6, 9)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 3, 5} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <6, (0, 1, 3)>, <6, (0, 1, 5)>, <6, (1, 3, 5)>, <6, (1, 5, 9)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {4, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 27

Therefore, there are a total of [27] 3-stars in your graph.
