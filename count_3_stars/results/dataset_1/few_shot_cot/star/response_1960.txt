Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 6

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {8, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {6, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-Star: <6, (0, 3, 9)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {3} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Only one 3-star configuration was found in this graph:
- From Node 6: 1

Therefore, there are a total of [1] 3-stars in your graph.
