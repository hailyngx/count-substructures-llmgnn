Node 3 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 5

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 7, 8, 9} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
    - 3-Stars: <0, (1, 8, 9)>, <0, (2, 7, 9)>, <0, (2, 8, 9)>, <0, (7, 8, 9)>, <0, (1, 7, 8)>, <0, (1, 2, 7)>, <0, (1, 2, 9)>, <0, (2, 5, 9)>, <0, (1, 5, 9)>, <0, (0, 5, 6)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 6, 9} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - 3-Stars: <1, (0, 6, 9)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 5} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - 3-Stars: <2, (0, 4, 5)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {8, 9} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {2, 8} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2, 6, 9} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - 3-Stars: <5, (2, 6, 9)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 5} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 4} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - 3-Stars: <8, (0, 3, 4)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 3, 5} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - 3-Stars: <9, (0, 1, 3)>, <9, (0, 1, 5)>, <9, (0, 3, 5)>, <9, (1, 3, 5)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 18

Therefore, there are a total of [18] 3-stars in your graph.
