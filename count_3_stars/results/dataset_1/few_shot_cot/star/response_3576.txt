Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 6

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {7, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5

Therefore, there are a total of [5] 3-stars in your graph.
