Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list provided, we'll compute the number of 3-star configurations for each eligible node:

- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {6, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 5, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-stars: 
    - <3, (1, 4, 5)>
    - <3, (1, 4, 6)>
    - <3, (1, 5, 6)>
    - <3, (4, 5, 6)>

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {3, 7, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-star:
    - <4, (3, 7, 8)>

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {3, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-stars:
    - <6, (2, 3, 8)>
    - <6, (2, 3, 9)>
    - <6, (2, 8, 9)>
    - <6, (3, 8, 9)>

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 6, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-stars:
    - <8, (0, 4, 6)>
    - <8, (0, 4, 9)>
    - <8, (0, 6, 9)>
    - <8, (4, 6, 9)>

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {2, 6, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-star:
    - <9, (2, 6, 8)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid 3-star configurations:
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 1
Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 14

Therefore, there are a total of [14] 3-stars in your graph.
