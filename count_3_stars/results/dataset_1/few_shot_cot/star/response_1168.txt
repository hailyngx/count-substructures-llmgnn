Node 3 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 6

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Unique 3-star: <1, (0, 4, 7)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Unique 3-star: <2, (5, 6, 7)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Unique 3-star: <3, (4, 8, 9)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Unique 3-star: <4, (1, 3, 5)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 7, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Unique 3-star: <5, (2, 7, 9)>, <5, (4, 7, 9)>, <5, (2, 4, 9)>, <5, (2, 4, 7)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {2, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 5, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Unique 3-star: <7, (1, 2, 5)>, <7, (1, 5, 8)>, <7, (2, 5, 8)>, <7, (1, 2, 8)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Unique 3-star: <8, (0, 3, 7)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Unique 3-star: <9, (3, 5, 6)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 14

Therefore, there are a total of [14] 3-stars in your graph.
