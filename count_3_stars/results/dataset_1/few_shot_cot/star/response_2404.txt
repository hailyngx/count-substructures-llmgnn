Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 5, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 4, 6, 7, 9} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
  - 3-star: <2, (0, 4, 6)>, <2, (0, 4, 7)>, <2, (0, 6, 7)>, <2, (4, 6, 7)>, <2, (0, 6, 9)>

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 7, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 6, 7, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 6, 7, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 7} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
  - 3-star: <7, (2, 4, 6)>, <7, (2, 4, 8)>, <7, (2, 5, 6)>, <7, (2, 5, 8)>, <7, (4, 5, 6)>, <7, (4, 5, 8)>  

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 20
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 20
- From Node 7: 20
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 20 + 1 = 90

Therefore, there are a total of [90] 3-stars in your graph.
