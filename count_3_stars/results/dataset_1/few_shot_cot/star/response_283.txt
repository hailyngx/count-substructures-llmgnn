Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {8, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 5, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8} (7 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{7}{3} = 35\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 9: 35

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 35 = 37
Therefore, there are a total of [37] 3-stars in your graph.
