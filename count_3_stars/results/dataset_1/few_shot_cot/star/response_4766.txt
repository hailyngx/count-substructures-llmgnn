Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 2} (2 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{2}{3}\) = 0
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 4, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - Possible 3-stars: <1, (0, 2, 4)>, <1, (0, 2, 8)>, <1, (2, 4, 8)>, <1, (0, 4, 8)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - Possible 3-star: <2, (0, 1, 6)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 7, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - Possible 3-stars: <3, (4, 5, 7)>, <3, (4, 5, 9)>, <3, (4, 7, 9)>, <3, (5, 7, 9)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{2}{3}\) = 0
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {3, 6, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - Possible 3-star: <5, (3, 6, 7)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - Possible 3-star: <6, (2, 5, 8)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - Possible 3-star: <7, (3, 5, 9)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{2}{3}\) = 0
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {3, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{2}{3}\) = 0

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 0: 0
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 0
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 0
- From Node 9: 0

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 11

Therefore, there are a total of [11] 3-stars in your graph.
