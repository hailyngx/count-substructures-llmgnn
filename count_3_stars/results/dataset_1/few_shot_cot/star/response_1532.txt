Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 6

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - Unique 3-star: <1, (2, 4, 5)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 6, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - Unique 3-stars: <2, (1, 3, 6)>, <2, (1, 3, 9)>, <2, (1, 6, 9)>, <2, (3, 6, 9)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - Unique 3-star: <5, (0, 1, 3)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {2, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {2, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Adding up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 5: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6
Therefore, there are a total of [6] 3-stars in your graph.
