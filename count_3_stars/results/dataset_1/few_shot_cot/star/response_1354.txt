Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9} (6 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 4, 8, 9} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 3} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 6} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 7, 8} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {6, 8} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 5} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 4} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 4, 5, 9} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 8} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 20
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 48

Therefore, there are a total of [48] 3-stars in your graph.
