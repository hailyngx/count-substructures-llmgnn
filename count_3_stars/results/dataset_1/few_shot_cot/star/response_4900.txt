Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, and node 6

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 6, 7, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 4, 6, 7, 9} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {2, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {7, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 7, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 1: 20
- From Node 2: 20
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 20
- From Node 9: 20

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 20 + 20 + 4 + 20 + 20 = 94

Therefore, there are a total of [94] 3-stars in your graph.
