Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 6

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {7, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-star: <0, (7, 8, 9)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {7, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-star: <3, (7, 8, 9)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {6} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {7, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 4, 8, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <6, (1, 2, 4)>, <6, (1, 2, 8)>, <6, (1, 2, 9)>, <6, (1, 4, 8)>, <6, (1, 4, 9)>, <6, (1, 8, 9)>, <6, (2, 4, 8)>, <6, (2, 4, 9)>, <6, (2, 8, 9)>, <6, (4, 8, 9)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-star: <7, (0, 3, 5)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-star: <8, (0, 3, 6)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 5, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <9, (0, 3, 5)>, <9, (0, 3, 6)>, <9, (0, 5, 6)>, <9, (3, 5, 6)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 18

Therefore, there are a total of [18] 3-stars in your graph.
