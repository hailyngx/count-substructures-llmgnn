Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 6

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 5, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - Unique 3-stars: <0, (1, 5, 8)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3}\) = 20
  - Unique 3-stars: <2, (3, 4, 5)>, <2, (3, 4, 6)>, <2, (3, 4, 9)>, <2, (3, 5, 6)>, <2, (3, 5, 9)>, <2, (3, 6, 9)>, <2, (4, 5, 6)>, <2, (4, 5, 9)>, <2, (4, 6, 9)>, <2, (5, 6, 9)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - Unique 3-stars: <4, (2, 3, 8)>, <4, (2, 3, 9)>, <4, (2, 8, 9)>, <4, (3, 8, 9)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - Unique 3-stars: <5, (0, 2, 6)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - Unique 3-stars: <6, (2, 5, 9)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - Unique 3-stars: <8, (0, 1, 4)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - Unique 3-stars: <9, (2, 4, 6)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Adding all valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 2: 20
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 20 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 29

Therefore, there are a total of [29] 3-stars in your graph.
