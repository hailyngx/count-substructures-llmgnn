Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 9
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {9} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <2, (4, 6, 9)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 5, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <3, (1, 5, 6)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {2, 6, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <4, (2, 6, 9)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {3, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 4, 5} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <6, (2, 4, 5)>, <6, (2, 4, 6)>, <6, (2, 5, 6)>, <6, (4, 5, 6)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {9} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 4, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <9, (0, 2, 4)>, <9, (0, 2, 7)>, <9, (0, 4, 7)>, <9, (2, 4, 7)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 11

Therefore, there are a total of [11] 3-stars in your graph.
