Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Star Configurations for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {6, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 6, 7, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {3} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {6} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 7, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 7, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 11

Therefore, there are a total of [11] 3-stars in your graph.
