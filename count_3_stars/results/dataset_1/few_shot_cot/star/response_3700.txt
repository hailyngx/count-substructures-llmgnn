Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {6} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Not connected to any other nodes.
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Not connected to any other nodes.
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {6, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 4, 8, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {3, 6, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 13
Therefore, there are a total of [13] 3-stars in your graph.
