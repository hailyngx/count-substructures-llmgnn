Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 5, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - Unique 3-star: <0, (1, 5, 7)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 7, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - Unique 3-stars: <1, (0, 7, 8)>, <1, (0, 7, 9)>, <1, (7, 8, 9)>, <1, (0, 8, 9)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {6} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - Unique 3-stars: <5, (0, 2, 9)>, <5, (0, 8, 9)>, <5, (2, 8, 9)>, <5, (0, 2, 8)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {4, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 3, 6, 8, 9} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3}\) = 20
  - Unique 3-stars: <7, (0, 1, 9)>, <7, (0, 8, 9)>, <7, (1, 8, 9)>, <7, (0, 1, 8)>, <7, (0, 1, 6)>, <7, (1, 6, 8)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 5, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - Unique 3-star: <8, (1, 5, 7)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 5, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - Unique 3-stars: <9, (1, 5, 7)>, <9, (1, 5, 2)>, <9, (1, 7, 5)>, <9, (5, 7, 2)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Adding all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 7: 20
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 1 + 4 = 34

Therefore, there are a total of [34] 3-stars in your graph.
