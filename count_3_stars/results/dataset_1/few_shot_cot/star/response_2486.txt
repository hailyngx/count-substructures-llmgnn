Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
  - <4, (0, 1, 2)>, <4, (0, 1, 3)>, <4, (0, 1, 5)>, <4, (0, 2, 3)>, <4, (0, 2, 5)>, <4, (0, 3, 5)>, <4, (1, 2, 3)>, <4, (1, 2, 5)>, <4, (1, 3, 5)>, <4, (0, 2, 6)>, <4, (0, 3, 6)>, <4, (0, 5, 6)>, <4, (1, 2, 6)>, <4, (1, 3, 6)>, <4, (1, 5, 6)>, <4, (2, 3, 6)>, <4, (2, 5, 6)>, <4, (3, 5, 6)>, <4, (0, 6, 5)>, <4, (1, 6, 5)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <5, (3, 4, 7)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 4, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <6, (0, 2, 4)>, <6, (0, 4, 9)>, <6, (2, 4, 9)>, <6, (0, 2, 9)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 5, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <7, (1, 5, 9)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {9} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {6, 7, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <9, (6, 7, 8)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 4: 20
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 9: 1
Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 27
Therefore, there are a total of [27] 3-stars in your graph.
