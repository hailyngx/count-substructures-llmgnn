Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Possible 3-stars:
    - <0, (4, 8, 9)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {6} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Possible 3-stars:
    - <3, (1, 4, 9)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {8, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 2} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {9} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 5, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Possible 3-stars:
    - <9, (0, 5, 7)>
    - <9, (0, 3, 7)>
    - <9, (0, 3, 5)>
    - <9, (5, 7, 0)>
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 9: 4
Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 = 9
Therefore, there are a total of [9] 3-stars in your graph.
