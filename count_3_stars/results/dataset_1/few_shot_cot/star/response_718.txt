Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {6, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 4, 6, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - Possible 3-star configurations: <2, (1, 4, 6)>, <2, (1, 4, 8)>, <2, (1, 6, 8)>, <2, (4, 6, 8)>, <2, (1, 4, 7)>, <2, (3, 4, 6)>, <2, (3, 4, 8)>, <2, (3, 6, 8)>, <2, (4, 6, 7)>, <2, (3, 6, 7)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 6, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Possible 3-star configurations: <3, (2, 5, 7)>, <3, (2, 6, 7)>, <3, (5, 6, 7)>, <3, (2, 4, 7)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Possible 3-star configuration: <4, (2, 5, 9)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {3, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 3, 7, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - Possible 3-star configurations: <6, (0, 3, 7)>, <6, (0, 3, 8)>, <6, (0, 7, 8)>, <6, (2, 3, 7)>, <6, (2, 3, 8)>, <6, (2, 7, 8)>, <6, (3, 7, 8)>, <6, (2, 5, 7)>, <6, (2, 5, 8)>, <6, (5, 7, 8)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {3, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2, 6, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Possible 3-star configuration: <8, (2, 6, 9)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 4, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Possible 3-star configurations: <9, (0, 4, 8)>, <9, (1, 4, 8)>, <9, (0, 2, 8)>, <9, (1, 2, 8)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 = 30

Therefore, there are a total of [30] 3-stars in your graph.
