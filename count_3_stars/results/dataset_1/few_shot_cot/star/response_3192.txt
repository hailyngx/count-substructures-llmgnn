Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 6
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6, and node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 3, 8} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - 3-Stars: <1, (0, 2, 3)>, <1, (0, 2, 8)>, <1, (0, 3, 2)>, <1, (0, 3, 8)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 6, 7} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - 3-Stars: <2, (1, 3, 6)>, <2, (1, 3, 7)>, <2, (1, 6, 3)>, <2, (1, 6, 7)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 6} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - 3-Stars: <3, (1, 2, 6)>
- **Node 4**: Not connected to any other nodes.
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Not connected to any other nodes.
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - 3-Stars: <6, (2, 3, 8)>, <6, (2, 3, 9)>, <6, (2, 8, 3)>, <6, (2, 8, 9)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - 3-Stars: <7, (2, 8, 9)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 6, 7} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - 3-Stars: <8, (1, 6, 7)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {6, 7} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 15

Therefore, there are a total of [15] 3-stars in your graph.
