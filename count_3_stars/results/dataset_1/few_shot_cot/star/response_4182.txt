Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {6, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-Star: <1, (5, 8, 9)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {7, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
  - 3-Stars:
    - <3, (4, 5, 6)>
    - <3, (4, 5, 7)>
    - <3, (4, 5, 8)>
    - <3, (4, 5, 9)>

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {3, 6, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-Star: <4, (3, 6, 8)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-Star: <5, (1, 3, 9)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 4, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

    - <6, (0, 3, 4)>
    - <6, (0, 3, 7)>
    - <6, (0, 4, 7)>
    - <6, (3, 4, 7)>

  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-Star: <7, (2, 3, 6)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - 3-Stars:
    - <8, (0, 1, 2)>
    - <8, (0, 1, 3)>

    - <8, (0, 2, 3)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Adding all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 3: 20
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 1
Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 20 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 39

Therefore, there are a total of [39] 3-stars in your graph.
