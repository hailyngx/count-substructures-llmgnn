Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 6, and node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 5} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 2} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 7} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {6, 7} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {6} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 8} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 9} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 9} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {6, 7} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4
Therefore, there are a total of [4] 3-stars in your graph.
