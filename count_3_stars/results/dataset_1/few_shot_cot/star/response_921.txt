Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <0, (1, 3, 9)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <1, (0, 2, 4)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 7, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <2, (1, 7, 9)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <3, (0, 4, 9)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 6, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <4, (1, 3, 6)>, <4, (1, 3, 8)>, <4, (1, 6, 8)>, <4, (3, 6, 8)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {6, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {4, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 7, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <8, (4, 5, 7)>, <8, (4, 5, 9)>, <8, (4, 7, 9)>, <8, (5, 7, 9)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 3, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <9, (0, 2, 3)>, <9, (0, 2, 8)>, <9, (0, 3, 8)>, <9, (2, 3, 8)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
From the valid configurations listed above:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 16

Therefore, there are a total of [16] 3-stars in your graph.
