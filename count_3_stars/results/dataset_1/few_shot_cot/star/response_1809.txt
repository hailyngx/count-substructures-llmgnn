Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 6, 8, 9} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9} (6 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 4, 7} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8} (6 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8} (6 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 6} (3 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 3, 5, 8} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3, 4, 8} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 7} (6 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 1} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Adding up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 1: 20
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 20
- From Node 4: 20
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 20

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 20 + 4 + 20 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 20 = 114

Therefore, there are a total of [114] 3-stars in your graph.
