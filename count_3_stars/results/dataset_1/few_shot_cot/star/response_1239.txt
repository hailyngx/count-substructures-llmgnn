Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 6, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <1, (0, 6, 9)>, <1, (0, 3, 6)>, <1, (0, 3, 9)>, <1, (6, 9, 3)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <4, (5, 7, 9)>, <4, (5, 7, 8)>, <4, (5, 9, 8)>, <4, (7, 9, 8)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {4, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 5, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <6, (1, 5, 7)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 6, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <7, (2, 4, 8)>, <7, (2, 6, 8)>, <7, (4, 6, 8)>, <7, (4, 8, 2)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 4, 7, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - <8, (0, 3, 9)>, <8, (0, 4, 7)>, <8, (0, 4, 9)>, <8, (0, 7, 9)>, <8, (3, 4, 7)>, <8, (3, 4, 9)>, <8, (3, 7, 9)>, <8, (4, 7, 9)>, <8, (7, 4, 9)>, <8, (7, 4, 3)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <9, (1, 4, 8)>
  
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 24

Therefore, there are a total of [24] 3-stars in your graph.
