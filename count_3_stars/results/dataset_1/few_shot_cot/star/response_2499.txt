Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 5
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 1

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 1} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 6, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-Stars: <4, (3, 5, 6)>, <4, (3, 5, 7)>, <4, (3, 6, 7)>, <4, (5, 6, 7)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-Stars: <5, (0, 4, 7)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-Stars: <7, (3, 4, 5)>
- **Node 8**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 (from Node 4) + 1 (from Node 5) + 1 (from Node 7) = 6

Therefore, there are a total of [6] 3-stars in your graph.
