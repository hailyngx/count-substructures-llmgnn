Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 6

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 6, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  3-Star: <0, (1, 6, 9)>
  
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 3, 6, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  3-Stars: <1, (0, 2, 3)>, <1, (0, 2, 6)>, <1, (0, 3, 6)>, <1, (2, 3, 6)>, <1, (0, 3, 8)>, <1, (2, 3, 8)>, <1, (0, 6, 8)>, <1, (2, 6, 8)>, <1, (3, 6, 8)>, <1, (0, 2, 8)>
  
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 5, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  3-Star: <2, (1, 3, 5)>
  
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 2} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {8, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 7, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  3-Star: <6, (0, 1, 7)>
  
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {6, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 4, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  3-Star: <8, (1, 2, 4)>

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  3-Star: <9, (0, 4, 6)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
From the analysis above, we have found a total of 20 unique 3-stars configurations.
Therefore, there are a total of [20] 3-stars in your graph.
