Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 5

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Possible 3-star: <1, (0, 8, 9)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 7, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Possible 3-stars: <2, (3, 5, 7)>, <2, (3, 5, 9)>, <2, (3, 7, 9)>, <2, (5, 7, 9)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Possible 3-star: <3, (2, 5, 9)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 7, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Possible 3-stars: <5, (2, 3, 9)>, <5, (2, 7, 9)>, <5, (3, 7, 9)>, <5, (2, 3, 7)>
- **Node 6**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 4, 5} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Possible 3-stars: <7, (0, 2, 5)>, <7, (0, 2, 4)>, <7, (0, 4, 5)>, <7, (2, 4, 5)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3, 5} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Possible 3-stars: <9, (1, 2, 5)>, <9, (1, 3, 5)>, <9, (2, 3, 5)>, <9, (1, 2, 3)>
  
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 18

Therefore, there are a total of [18] 3-stars in your graph.
