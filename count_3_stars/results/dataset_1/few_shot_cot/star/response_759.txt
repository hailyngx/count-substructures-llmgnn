Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 5, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - 3-Stars: <1, (0, 3, 5)>, <1, (0, 5, 9)>, <1, (3, 5, 9)>, <1, (0, 3, 9)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - 3-Stars: <3, (1, 4, 5)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {2, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 6, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - 3-Stars: <5, (1, 3, 6)>, <5, (1, 3, 7)>, <5, (1, 6, 7)>, <5, (3, 6, 7)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - 3-Stars: <8, (0, 2, 9)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 6, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - 3-Stars: <9, (1, 6, 8)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 11
Therefore, there are a total of [11] 3-stars in your graph.
