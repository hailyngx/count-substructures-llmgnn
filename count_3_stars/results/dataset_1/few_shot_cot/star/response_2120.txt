Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 3

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 7, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Possible 3-star: <1, (3, 7, 9)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 5, 6, 8, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - Possible 3-stars: <3, (1, 5, 6)>, <3, (1, 6, 9)>, <3, (5, 6, 9)>, <3, (1, 5, 9)>, <3, (1, 6, 8)>, <3, (6, 8, 9)>, <3, (5, 6, 8)>, <3, (5, 8, 9)>, <3, (1, 8, 9)>, <3, (1, 5, 8)>
- **Node 4**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {3, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Possible 3-star: <6, (2, 3, 5)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {3} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Possible 3-star: <9, (0, 1, 3)>
 
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 13

Therefore, there are a total of [13] 3-stars in your graph.
