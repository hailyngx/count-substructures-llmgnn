Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 7
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 1

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {6, 7, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - Unique 3-star: <0, (6, 7, 9)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 6, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - Unique 3-star: <5, (1, 6, 8)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 5, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - Unique 3-star: <6, (0, 5, 8)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 1} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Total number of 3-stars = 1 (from Node 0) + 1 (from Node 5) + 1 (from Node 6) = 3

Therefore, there are a total of [3] 3-stars in your graph.
