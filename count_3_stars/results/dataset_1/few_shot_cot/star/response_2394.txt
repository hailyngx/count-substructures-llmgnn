Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 6
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 3

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:  
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3, 6, 9} (5 neighbors)  
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 6, 7, 9} (4 neighbors)  
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 6, 9} (4 neighbors)  
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 7, 9} (4 neighbors)  
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {6} (1 neighbor)  
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: No neighbors  
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2, 4, 7} (5 neighbors)  
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 6, 8} (4 neighbors)  
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor)  
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2, 3} (4 neighbors)  
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:  
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 40  
Therefore, there are a total of [40] 3-stars in your graph.
