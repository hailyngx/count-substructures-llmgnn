Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {6} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {6, 7, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-star: <2, (6, 7, 8)>
- **Node 3**: Isolated node
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {6, 7, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-star: <4, (6, 7, 9)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {6} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 4, 5, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <6, (1, 2, 4)>, <6, (1, 2, 7)>, <6, (1, 4, 5)>, <6, (1, 5, 7)>, <6, (2, 4, 5)>, <6, (2, 4, 7)>, <6, (2, 5, 7)>, <6, (4, 5, 7)>, <6, (2, 4, 9)>, <6, (4, 7, 9)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 6, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <7, (2, 4, 6)>, <7, (2, 4, 9)>, <7, (2, 6, 9)>, <7, (4, 6, 9)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-star: <8, (0, 2, 9)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-star: <9, (4, 7, 8)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 1
Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 18

Therefore, there are a total of [18] 3-stars in the provided graph.
