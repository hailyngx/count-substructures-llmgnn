Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 2) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 5, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {8, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {6} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {3, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-Star: <4, (3, 8, 9)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-Star: <8, (1, 4, 9)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 4, 5, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - 3-Stars: <9, (1, 4, 8)>, <9, (1, 4, 3)>, <9, (1, 3, 8)>, <9, (4, 3, 8)>, <9, (4, 5, 8)>, <9, (1, 5, 8)>, <9, (1, 4, 5)>, <9, (1, 3, 5)>, <9, (4, 3, 5)>, <9, (3, 5, 8)>
  
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 10 = 12

Therefore, there are a total of [12] 3-stars in your graph.
