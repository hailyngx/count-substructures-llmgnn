Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 4

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:  
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {3, 8} (2 neighbors)  
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.  
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)  
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
  - Possible 3-stars: <1, (2, 4, 8)>, <1, (2, 4, 9)>, <1, (4, 8, 9)>, <1, (2, 8, 9)>  
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 6} (3 neighbors)  
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
  - Possible 3-star: <2, (1, 4, 6)>  
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0} (1 neighbor)  
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.  
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 6, 8, 9} (5 neighbors)  
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
  - Possible 3-stars: <4, (1, 2, 6)>, <4, (1, 2, 8)>, <4, (1, 2, 9)>, <4, (1, 6, 8)>, <4, (1, 6, 9)>, <4, (1, 8, 9)>, <4, (2, 6, 8)>, <4, (2, 6, 9)>, <4, (2, 8, 9)>, <4, (6, 8, 9)>  
- **Node 5**: Not connected to any other nodes.  
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.  
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {2, 4} (2 neighbors)  
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.  
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)  
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.  
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 4, 7} (4 neighbors)  
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
  - Possible 3-stars: <8, (0, 1, 4)>, <8, (0, 1, 7)>, <8, (0, 4, 7)>, <8, (1, 4, 7)>  
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 4} (2 neighbors)  
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.  
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:  
- From Node 1: 4  
- From Node 2: 1  
- From Node 4: 10  
- From Node 8: 4  
Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 19  
Therefore, there are a total of [19] 3-stars in your graph.
