Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 8) (4, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 4, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 6, 7} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
    - <0, (1, 6, 7)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 6, 8, 9} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    - <1, (0, 2, 8)>, <1, (0, 2, 9)>, <1, (0, 8, 9)>, <1, (2, 8, 9)>, <1, (6, 8, 9)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 9} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {7, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
    - <3, (7, 8, 9)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {8, 9} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: No neighbors
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 1} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 8} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
    - <7, (0, 3, 8)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 4, 7, 9} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    - <8, (1, 3, 9)>, <8, (1, 4, 9)>, <8, (1, 7, 9)>, <8, (3, 4, 9)>, <8, (3, 7, 9)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3, 4, 8} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    - <9, (1, 3, 8)>, <9, (1, 4, 8)>, <9, (1, 8, 3)>, <9, (3, 4, 8)>, <9, (3, 8, 7)>
    
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 10
Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 = 33

Therefore, there are a total of [33] 3-stars in your graph.
