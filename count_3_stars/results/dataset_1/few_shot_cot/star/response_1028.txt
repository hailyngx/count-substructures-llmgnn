Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 6, 7, and node 8

Response:
Given the adjacency list provided, we will now calculate the number of 3-stars formed around each node that has three or more neighbors:

- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 7, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-star configurations: <2, (1, 7, 9)>, <2, (4, 7, 9)>, <4, (1, 2, 7)>, <9, (1, 2, 7)>

- **Node 3**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {7, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 6, 8, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - Unique 3-star configurations: <7, (2, 6, 9)>, <7, (2, 8, 9)>, <9, (2, 6, 7)>, <9, (2, 7, 8)>, <2, (7, 8, 9)>

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {7, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {2, 6, 7, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-star configurations: <9, (2, 6, 7)>, <9, (2, 7, 8)>, <2, (7, 8, 9)>, <7, (2, 6, 9)>

Summing up the total number of 3-stars:
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 4 = 18

Therefore, there are a total of [18] 3-stars in your graph.
