Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1

Node 3 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 6, and node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 4, 7, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - Unique 3-star configurations from Node 1: <0, (2, 4, 7)>, <2, (0, 4, 7)>, <4, (0, 2, 7)>, <7, (0, 2, 4)>, <9, (0, 2, 7)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 6, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-star configurations from Node 2: <1, (6, 9)>, <6, (1, 9)>, <9, (1, 6)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-star configurations from Node 3: <4, (5, 9)>, <5, (4, 9)>, <9, (4, 5)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-star configurations from Node 4: <1, (3, 6)>, <3, (1, 6)>, <6, (1, 3)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {3} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-star configurations from Node 6: <2, (4, 9)>, <4, (2, 9)>, <9, (2, 4)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-star configurations from Node 7: <1, (8, 9)>, <8, (1, 9)>, <9, (1, 8)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3, 6, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - Unique 3-star configurations from Node 9: <1, (2, 7)>, <2, (1, 7)>, <3, (6, 9)>, <6, (3, 9)>, <7, (1, 2)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Adding all valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 9: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 25

Therefore, there are a total of [25] 3-stars in your graph.
