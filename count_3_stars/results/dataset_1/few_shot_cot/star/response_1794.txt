Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 4, 5, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 6, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 5, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 6, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 4, 5, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 6, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 4, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 9**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 36

Therefore, there are a total of [36] 3-stars in your graph.
