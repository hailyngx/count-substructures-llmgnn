Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 7) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 7
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 5

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 2} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2, 6, 7, 8, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - Possible 3-stars: <5, (2, 6, 7)>, <5, (2, 7, 8)>, <5, (2, 6, 8)>, <5, (6, 7, 8)>, <5, (7, 8, 9)>, <5, (6, 8, 9)>, <5, (6, 7, 9)>, <5, (2, 7, 9)>, <5, (2, 8, 9)>, <5, (7, 8, 9)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {3, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
From Node 5: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 10

Therefore, there are a total of [10] 3-stars in your graph.
