Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 10 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (5, 3) (7, 0) (7, 9) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 3
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 3
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Not connected to any node.
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {3} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Not connected to any node.
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Not connected to any node.
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- None of the nodes have enough neighbors to form a 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 0

Therefore, there are a total of [0] 3-stars in your graph.
