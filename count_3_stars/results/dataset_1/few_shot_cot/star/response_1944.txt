Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 6, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {3, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {3, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 3: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 = 5
Therefore, there are a total of [5] 3-stars in your graph. 

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 6, 8)>
<0, (1, 2, 6)>
<0, (1, 2, 8)>
<0, (2, 6, 8)>
<3, (4, 7, 8)>
