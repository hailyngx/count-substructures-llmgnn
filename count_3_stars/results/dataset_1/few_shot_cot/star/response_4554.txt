Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 6, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Three-stars: <3, (0, 1, 6)>, <3, (0, 1, 7)>, <3, (0, 6, 7)>, <3, (1, 6, 7)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {4, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {3, 7, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Three-stars: <6, (3, 7, 8)>, <6, (3, 7, 9)>, <6, (3, 8, 9)>, <6, (7, 8, 9)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 6, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Three-stars: <7, (3, 5, 6)>, <7, (3, 5, 9)>, <7, (3, 6, 9)>, <7, (5, 6, 9)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {6, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {6, 7, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Three-star: <9, (6, 7, 8)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 13

Therefore, there are a total of [13] 3-stars in your graph.
