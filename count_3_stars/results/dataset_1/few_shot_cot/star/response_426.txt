Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 7, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <0, (4, 6, 7)>, <0, (4, 6, 9)>, <0, (4, 7, 9)>, <0, (6, 7, 9)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {7, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 6, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <3, (4, 5, 6)>, <3, (4, 5, 7)>, <3, (4, 6, 7)>, <3, (5, 6, 7)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 5, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <4, (0, 3, 5)>, <4, (0, 3, 6)>, <4, (0, 5, 6)>, <4, (3, 5, 6)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 4, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <5, (2, 3, 4)>, <5, (2, 3, 7)>, <5, (2, 4, 7)>, <5, (3, 4, 7)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <6, (0, 3, 4)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 3, 5, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - <7, (0, 1, 3)>, <7, (0, 1, 5)>, <7, (0, 1, 9)>, <7, (0, 3, 5)>, <7, (0, 3, 9)>, <7, (0, 5, 9)>, <7, (1, 3, 5)>, <7, (1, 3, 9)>, <7, (1, 5, 9)>, <7, (3, 5, 9)>
- **Node 8**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <9, (0, 1, 2)>, <9, (0, 1, 7)>, <9, (0, 2, 7)>, <9, (1, 2, 7)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 31

Therefore, there are a total of [31] 3-stars in your graph.
