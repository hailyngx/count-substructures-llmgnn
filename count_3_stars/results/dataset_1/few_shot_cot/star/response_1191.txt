Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, 7, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 9} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {9} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 8} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {7, 8} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 5, 6} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {4, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {3, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 6, 7, 9} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 6, 7, 8} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 10
Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 = 24
Therefore, there are a total of [24] 3-stars in your graph.
