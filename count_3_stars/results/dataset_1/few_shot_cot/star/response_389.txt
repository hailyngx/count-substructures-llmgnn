Node 9 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 5

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <1, (3, 4, 5)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 5, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <3, (1, 5, 8)>, <3, (1, 5, 9)>, <3, (1, 8, 9)>, <3, (5, 8, 9)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 8, 9} (7 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{7}{3} = 35\)
  - Unique 3-stars: 
    - <4, (0, 1, 2)>, 
    - <4, (0, 1, 5)>, <4, (2, 1, 5)>, 
    - <4, (0, 1, 6)>, <4, (0, 5, 6)>, <4, (1, 5, 6)>, 
    - <4, (0, 1, 8)>, <4, (0, 5, 8)>, <4, (1, 5, 8)>, <4, (1, 8, 9)>, <4, (5, 8, 9)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 4, 6, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - Unique 3-stars: 
    - <5, (1, 3, 4)>, 
    - <5, (1, 4, 6)>, 
    - <5, (1, 4, 9)>, 
    - <5, (3, 4, 6)>, <5, (3, 4, 9)>, <5, (4, 6, 9)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <6, (4, 5, 7)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {3, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <9, (3, 4, 5)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 35
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 35 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 52

Therefore, there are a total of [52] 3-stars in your graph.
