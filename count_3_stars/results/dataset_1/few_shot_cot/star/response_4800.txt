Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 6

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {6} (1 neighbor)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 3} (2 neighbors)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 5, 6, 9} (4 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  <2, (1, 5, 9)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1} (1 neighbor)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {6} (1 neighbor)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2, 6, 9} (3 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  <5, (2, 6, 9)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 4, 5, 9} (5 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  <6, (0, 4, 5)>, <6, (0, 5, 9)>, <6, (4, 5, 9)>, <6, (0, 4, 9)>, <6, (2, 5, 9)>, <6, (0, 2, 4)>, <6, (2, 4, 5)>, <6, (2, 4, 9)>, <6, (2, 5, 6)>, <6, (5, 9, 2)>
- **Node 7**: No neighbors
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 8**: No neighbors
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 6} (3 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  <9, (2, 5, 6)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 13

Therefore, there are a total of [13] 3-stars in your graph.
