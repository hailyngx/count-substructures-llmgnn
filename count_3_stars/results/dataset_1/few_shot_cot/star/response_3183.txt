Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 5

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {6, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 7, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - <1, (3, 7, 9)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - <2, (3, 4, 7)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 5, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - <3, (1, 2, 7)>, <3, (1, 5, 7)>, <3, (2, 4, 7)>, <3, (2, 5, 7)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 6, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - <4, (2, 5, 9)>, <4, (2, 6, 9)>, <4, (5, 6, 4)>, <4, (5, 9, 1)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - <5, (3, 8, 5)>, <5, (4, 8, 5)>, <5, (4, 9, 5)>, <5, (8, 9, 5)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2, 3} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - <7, (0, 1, 3)>, <7, (0, 2, 3)>, <7, (1, 2, 3)>, <7, (1, 5, 3)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - <9, (1, 4, 5)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 19

Therefore, there are a total of [19] 3-stars in your graph.
