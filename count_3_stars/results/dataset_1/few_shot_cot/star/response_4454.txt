Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: No neighbors. Cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <1, (3, 4, 7)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <2, (3, 4, 7)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <3, (1, 2, 7)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 6, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <4, (1, 2, 6)>, <4, (1, 2, 8)>, <4, (1, 6, 8)>, <4, (2, 6, 8)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3, 5, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - <7, (1, 2, 3)>, <7, (1, 2, 8)>, <7, (1, 3, 5)>, <7, (1, 3, 8)>, <7, (1, 5, 8)>, <7, (2, 3, 5)>, <7, (2, 3, 8)>, <7, (2, 5, 8)>, <7, (3, 5, 8)>, <7, (1, 2, 5)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <8, (4, 7, 9)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Adding up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 18

Therefore, there are a total of [18] 3-stars in your graph.
