Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 3

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9} (6 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {9} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 6, 7, 9} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 7, 9} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 3, 8} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 7} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2, 3} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 20
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 34  
Therefore, there are a total of [34] 3-stars in your graph.
