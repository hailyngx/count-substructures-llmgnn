Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 5, 6, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - Possible 3-star configurations: <1, (0, 3, 5)>, <1, (0, 3, 6)>, <1, (0, 3, 8)>, <1, (5, 6, 8)>, <1, (5, 8, 6)>, <1, (6, 5, 8)>, <1, (6, 8, 5)>, <1, (8, 5, 6)>, <1, (8, 6, 5)>, <1, (0, 5, 6)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {7, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 4, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Possible 3-star configurations: <3, (0, 1, 7)>, <3, (0, 1, 4)>, <3, (1, 7, 0)>, <3, (1, 4, 0)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {3, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Possible 3-star configuration: <7, (2, 3, 9)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 5, 6, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - Possible 3-star configurations: <8, (1, 5, 6)>, <8, (1, 5, 9)>, <8, (1, 6, 9)>, <8, (5, 6, 9)>, <8, (5, 9, 6)>, <8, (6, 5, 9)>, <8, (6, 9, 5)>, <8, (9, 5, 6)>, <8, (9, 6, 5)>, <8, (1, 6, 5)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Possible 3-star configuration: <9, (4, 7, 8)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 26

Therefore, there are a total of [26] 3-stars in the given graph.
