Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-star: <1, (3, 5, 6)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {6, 7, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-star: <2, (6, 7, 8)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-star: <3, (1, 8, 9)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 6, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-star: <5, (1, 6, 9)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-star: <6, (1, 2, 5)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-star: <8, (2, 3, 9)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-star: <9, (3, 5, 8)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 7
Therefore, there are a total of [7] 3-stars in your graph.
