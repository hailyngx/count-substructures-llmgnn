Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 5

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {7, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - <2, (7, 8, 9)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - <4, (3, 5, 8)>, <4, (3, 5, 9)>, <4, (3, 8, 9)>, <4, (5, 8, 9)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - <5, (4, 8, 9)>, <5, (4, 6, 8)>, <5, (4, 6, 9)>, <5, (8, 6, 9)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - <7, (0, 1, 2)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - <8, (2, 4, 5)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 4, 5} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - <9, (2, 4, 5)>, <9, (2, 3, 4)>, <9, (2, 3, 5)>, <9, (3, 4, 5)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
From Node 2: 1
From Node 4: 4
From Node 5: 4
From Node 7: 1
From Node 8: 1
From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 15

Therefore, there are a total of [15] 3-stars in your graph.
