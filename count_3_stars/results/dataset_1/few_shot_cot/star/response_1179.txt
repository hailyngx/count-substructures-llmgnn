Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 5

Response:
Given the adjacency list provided, we will now calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {3, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 6, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 5, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {9} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 2}  (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {4, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing up the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 5: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 13

Therefore, there are a total of [13] 3-stars in the given graph.
