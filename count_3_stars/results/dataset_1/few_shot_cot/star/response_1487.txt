Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 5} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
    - <0, (1, 4, 5)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9} (6 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
    - <1, (0, 5, 8)>, <1, (0, 5, 3)>, <1, (0, 6, 8)>, <1, (0, 8, 3)>, <1, (5, 8, 3)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {6, 7, 8} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
    - <2, (6, 7, 8)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 5, 7, 8} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - <3, (1, 5, 8)>, <3, (1, 7, 8)>, <3, (5, 7, 8)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 7, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - <4, (0, 7, 8)>, <4, (0, 8, 9)>, <4, (7, 8, 9)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 3, 8} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - <5, (0, 3, 8)>, <5, (1, 3, 8)>, <5, (0, 1, 8)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 2} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 4, 9} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - <7, (2, 3, 4)>, <7, (2, 4, 9)>, <7, (3, 4, 9)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    - <8, (1, 3, 5)>, <8, (1, 4, 5)>, <8, (3, 4, 5)>, <8, (1, 3, 4)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 7} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
    - <9, (1, 4, 7)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 20
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 20 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 49

Therefore, there are a total of [49] 3-stars in your graph.
