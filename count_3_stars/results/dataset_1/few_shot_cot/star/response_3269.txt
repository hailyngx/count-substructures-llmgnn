Node 6 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 4

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 7, 8, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - Unique 3-star configurations:
    - <0, (2, 3, 7)>
    - <0, (2, 3, 8)>
    - <0, (2, 3, 9)>
    - <0, (2, 7, 8)>
    - <0, (2, 7, 9)>
    - <0, (2, 8, 9)>
    - <0, (3, 7, 8)>
    - <0, (3, 7, 9)>
    - <0, (3, 8, 9)>
    - <0, (7, 8, 9)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 7, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Unique 3-star configurations:
    - <1, (2, 5, 7)>
    - <1, (2, 5, 9)>
    - <1, (5, 7, 9)>
    - <1, (2, 7, 9)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 4, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Unique 3-star configurations:
    - <2, (0, 1, 4)>
    - <2, (0, 1, 6)>
    - <2, (0, 4, 6)>
    - <2, (1, 4, 6)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {2, 6, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 5, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Unique 3-star configurations:
    - <7, (0, 1, 5)>
    - <7, (0, 1, 6)>
    - <7, (0, 1, 6)>
    - <7, (1, 5, 6)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
  - From Node 0: 10
  - From Node 1: 4
  - From Node 2: 4
  - From Node 7: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 22
Therefore, there are a total of [22] 3-stars in your graph.
