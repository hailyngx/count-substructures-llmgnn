Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 5) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 6) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 5
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 9} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: No neighbors
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 2} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {7, 8} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {6} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {6} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Since none of the nodes have 3 or more neighbors, there are no 3-stars in this graph.

Therefore, there are a total of [0] 3-stars in your graph.
