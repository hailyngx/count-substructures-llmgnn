Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 7, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Unique 3-star configurations: <1, (4, 6, 7)>, <1, (4, 6, 8)>, <1, (4, 7, 8)>, <1, (6, 7, 8)>

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {9} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 6, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Unique 3-star configuration: <4, (1, 6, 8)>

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {3} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Unique 3-star configuration: <6, (1, 4, 8)>

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 7} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
  - Unique 3-star configurations: <8, (0, 1, 3)>, <8, (0, 1, 4)>, <8, (0, 1, 6)>, <8, (0, 1, 7)>, <8, (0, 3, 4)>, <8, (0, 3, 6)>, <8, (0, 3, 7)>, <8, (0, 4, 6)>, <8, (0, 4, 7)>, <8, (0, 6, 7)>, <8, (1, 3, 4)>, <8, (1, 3, 6)>, <8, (1, 3, 7)>, <8, (1, 4, 6)>, <8, (1, 4, 7)>, <8, (1, 6, 7)>, <8, (3, 4, 6)>, <8, (3, 4, 7)>, <8, (3, 6, 7)>, <8, (4, 6, 7)>

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 8: 20

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 20 = 26

Therefore, there are a total of [26] 3-stars in your graph.
