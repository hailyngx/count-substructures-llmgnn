Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 4

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 5, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <1, (3, 4, 5)>
  - <1, (3, 4, 9)>
  - <1, (3, 5, 9)>
  - <1, (4, 5, 9)>
- **Node 2**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 5, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <3, (1, 5, 6)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 7, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <4, (1, 7, 9)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <5, (1, 3, 8)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {3} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <7, (0, 4, 8)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 7: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 8

Therefore, there are a total of [8] 3-stars in your graph.
