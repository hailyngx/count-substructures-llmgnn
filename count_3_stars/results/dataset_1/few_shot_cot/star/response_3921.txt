Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 3

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {7, 9} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 7} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - 3-Stars: <2, (5, 6, 7)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 5, 6, 9} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - 3-Stars: <3, (1, 5, 6)>, <3, (1, 5, 9)>, <3, (6, 5, 7)>, <3, (6, 7, 9)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 7} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - 3-Stars: <5, (2, 3, 7)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 7} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - 3-Stars: <6, (2, 3, 7)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 5, 6} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - 3-Stars: <7, (0, 2, 5)>, <7, (0, 2, 6)>, <7, (0, 5, 6)>, <7, (2, 5, 6)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 3} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 11

Therefore, there are a total of [11] 3-stars in your graph.
