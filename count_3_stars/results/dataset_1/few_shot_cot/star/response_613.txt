Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (6, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 9
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 6

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-Star: <3, (1, 2, 4)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 5, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-Stars: 
    - <4, (0, 3, 5)>
    - <4, (3, 5, 8)>
    - <4, (0, 3, 8)>
    - <4, (0, 5, 8)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-Star: <8, (1, 2, 4)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {6} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 8: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6

Therefore, there are a total of [6] 3-stars in your graph.
