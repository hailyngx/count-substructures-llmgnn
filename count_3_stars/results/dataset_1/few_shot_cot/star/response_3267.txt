Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 8

Node 4 is connected to node 2, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {2, 6, 7, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - <4, (2, 6, 7)>, <4, (2, 6, 9)>, <4, (2, 7, 9)>, <4, (6, 7, 9)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {7, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - <5, (7, 8, 9)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - <6, (4, 7, 9)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - <7, (4, 5, 6)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 5, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - <8, (2, 3, 5)>, <8, (2, 3, 9)>, <8, (2, 5, 9)>, <8, (3, 5, 9)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 6, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - <9, (4, 5, 6)>, <9, (4, 5, 8)>, <9, (4, 6, 8)>, <9, (5, 6, 8)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 15
Therefore, there are a total of [15] 3-stars in your graph.
