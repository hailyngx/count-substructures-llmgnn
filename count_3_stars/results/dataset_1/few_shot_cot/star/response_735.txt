Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 5, 8, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - <0, (2, 4, 8)>, <0, (2, 4, 9)>, <0, (2, 5, 9)>, <0, (4, 5, 9)>, <0, (4, 8, 9)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 6, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - <1, (3, 4, 6)>, <1, (3, 4, 7)>, <1, (3, 6, 7)>, <1, (4, 6, 7)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 6, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - <2, (0, 4, 6)>, <2, (0, 4, 9)>, <2, (0, 6, 9)>, <2, (4, 6, 9)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 6, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - <3, (1, 6, 8)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2, 5, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - <4, (0, 2, 5)>, <4, (0, 2, 7)>, <4, (0, 5, 7)>, <4, (2, 5, 7)>, <4, (0, 5, 7)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - <6, (1, 3, 8)>, <6, (1, 6, 8)>, <6, (2, 3, 8)>, <6, (2, 6, 8)>
- **Node 7**:  Neighbors = {1, 4, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - <7, (1, 4, 9)>
- **Node 8**:  Neighbors = {0, 3, 6, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - <8, (0, 3, 6)>, <8, (0, 3, 9)>, <8, (0, 6, 9)>, <8, (3, 6, 9)>
- **Node 9**:  Neighbors = {0, 2, 7, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - <9, (0, 2, 7)>, <9, (0, 2, 8)>, <9, (0, 7, 8)>, <9, (2, 7, 8)>
  
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 42

Therefore, there are a total of [42] 3-stars in your graph.
