Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 4

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: No neighbors. Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor). Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4, 6} (2 neighbors). Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor). Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 9} (3 neighbors).
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-star: <4, (2, 5, 9)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 7, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-stars: 
    - <5, (1, 4, 7)>
    - <5, (1, 4, 8)>
    - <5, (7, 8, 4)>
    - <5, (8, 7, 4)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {2, 8} (2 neighbors). Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5, 8} (2 neighbors). Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 6, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-stars:
    - <8, (3, 5, 6)>
    - <8, (3, 5, 7)>
    - <8, (6, 5, 7)>
    - <8, (7, 5, 6)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor). Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 8: 4
Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 = 9

Therefore, there are a total of [9] 3-stars in your graph.
