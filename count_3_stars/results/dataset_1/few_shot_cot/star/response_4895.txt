Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 3

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: No neighbors so it cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {7, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {7, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {3, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {3} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 8: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1

Therefore, there is a total of [1] 3-star in your graph.
