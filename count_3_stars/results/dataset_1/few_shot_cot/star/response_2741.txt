Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8

Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-Star: <0, (1, 3, 8)>

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-Star: <1, (0, 2, 5)>

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-Star: <2, (1, 3, 9)>

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 5, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-Stars: <3, (0, 2, 5)>, <3, (0, 5, 7)>, <3, (2, 5, 7)>, <3, (0, 2, 7)>

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-Star: <4, (5, 6, 9)>

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 4, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-Stars: <5, (1, 3, 4)>, <5, (1, 3, 9)>, <5, (1, 4, 9)>, <5, (3, 4, 9)>

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {3} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 5, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-Stars: <9, (2, 4, 5)>, <9, (2, 4, 8)>, <9, (2, 5, 8)>, <9, (4, 5, 8)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
  - From Node 0: 1
  - From Node 1: 1
  - From Node 2: 1
  - From Node 3: 4
  - From Node 4: 1
  - From Node 5: 4
  - Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 12

Therefore, there are a total of [12] 3-stars in your graph.
