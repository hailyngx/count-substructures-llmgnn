Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 4) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {9} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 7, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Possible 3-stars: <3, (4, 6, 7)>, <3, (4, 6, 8)>, <3, (4, 7, 8)>, <3, (6, 7, 8)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 5, 8, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - Possible 3-stars: <4, (1, 5, 9)>, <4, (1, 8, 9)>, <4, (3, 5, 9)>, <4, (3, 8, 9)>, <4, (5, 8, 9)>, <4, (1, 3, 9)>, <4, (1, 8, 5)>, <4, (3, 5, 8)>, <4, (3, 5, 8)>, <4, (5, 8, 9)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {4, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {3, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {3, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Possible 3-star: <8, (3, 4, 6)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 5, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Possible 3-stars: <9, (0, 5, 7)>, <9, (0, 4, 5)>, <9, (0, 4, 7)>, <9, (5, 4, 7)>
        
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 4
Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 = 19
Therefore, there are a total of [19] 3-stars in your graph.
