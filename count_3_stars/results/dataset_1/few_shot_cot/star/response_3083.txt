Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 4

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 4, 5, 6} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {7, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 7, 8, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 2} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 4: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 = 20
Therefore, there are a total of [20] 3-stars in your graph.
