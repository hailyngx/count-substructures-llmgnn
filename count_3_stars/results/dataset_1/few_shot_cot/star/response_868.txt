Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node:

Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, 7, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4, 9} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 6} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {6, 8} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 9} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 6, 7, 8} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - <4, (0, 6, 8)>, <4, (0, 6, 7)>, <4, (0, 7, 8)>, <4, (6, 7, 8)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 8} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - <5, (1, 3, 8)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 4, 7} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - <6, (1, 2, 4)>, <6, (1, 4, 7)>, <6, (4, 7, 2)>, <6, (1, 7, 2)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 9} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - <7, (4, 6, 9)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 5, 9} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - <8, (2, 4, 5)>, <8, (2, 4, 9)>, <8, (2, 5, 9)>, <8, (4, 5, 9)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 7, 8} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - <9, (0, 3, 8)>, <9, (0, 3, 7)>, <9, (0, 7, 8)>, <9, (3, 7, 8)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 18

Therefore, there are a total of [18] 3-stars in your graph.
