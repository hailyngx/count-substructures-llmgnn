Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {7, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-Stars: <4, (0, 2, 8)>, <4, (0, 8, 9)>, <4, (2, 8, 9)>, <4, (0, 2, 9)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-Star: <5, (0, 1, 6)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {3, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-Star: <7, (3, 8, 9)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 4, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-Stars: <8, (1, 2, 4)>, <8, (1, 4, 7)>, <8, (1, 2, 7)>, <8, (2, 4, 7)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-Star: <9, (3, 4, 7)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 1
Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 11
Therefore, there are a total of [11] 3-stars in your graph.
