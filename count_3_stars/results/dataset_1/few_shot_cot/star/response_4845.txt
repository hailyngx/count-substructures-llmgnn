Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {8, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {6, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <3, (6, 8, 9)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <5, (2, 8, 9)>, <5, (4, 8, 9)>, <5, (2, 4, 9)>, <5, (2, 4, 8)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {3, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 4, 5, 6} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - <8, (0, 3, 4)>, <8, (0, 3, 5)>, <8, (0, 3, 6)>, <8, (0, 4, 5)>, <8, (0, 4, 6)>, <8, (0, 5, 6)>, <8, (3, 4, 5)>, <8, (3, 4, 6)>, <8, (3, 5, 6)>, <8, (4, 5, 6)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 5, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <9, (0, 3, 5)>, <9, (0, 3, 7)>, <9, (0, 5, 7)>, <9, (3, 5, 7)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 19

Therefore, there are a total of [19] 3-stars in your graph.
