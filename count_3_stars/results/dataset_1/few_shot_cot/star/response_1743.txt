Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {3, 4} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 6} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 5, 9} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 9} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3, 8} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {9} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 5} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 4, 7} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 14

Therefore, there are a total of [14] 3-stars in your graph.
