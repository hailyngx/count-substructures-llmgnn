Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 8
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 6

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: No neighbors, cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 5**: No neighbors, cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {3, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
There is only one valid 3-star configuration from Node 4.

Total number of 3-stars = 1

Therefore, there are a total of [1] 3-star in your graph.
