Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (8, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 4
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 6, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 
  - Possible 3-stars with Node 4:  
    <4, (0, 3, 6)>  
    <4, (0, 3, 8)>  
    <4, (0, 6, 8)>  
    <4, (3, 6, 8)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
The total number of 3-stars in the graph is the sum of valid 3-stars found in each eligible node:
- From Node 4: 4
Total number of 3-stars = 4

Therefore, there are a total of [4] 3-stars in your graph.
