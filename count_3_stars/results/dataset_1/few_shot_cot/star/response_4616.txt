Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - <0, (1, 3, 5)>
  
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 6, 7, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - <1, (0, 6, 7)>, <1, (0, 6, 8)>, <1, (0, 7, 8)>, <1, (6, 7, 8)>
  
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 5, 7, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - <3, (0, 5, 7)>, <3, (0, 5, 8)>, <3, (0, 7, 8)>, <3, (5, 7, 8)>
  
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 3, 7, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - <5, (0, 2, 3)>, <5, (0, 2, 7)>, <5, (0, 2, 8)>, <5, (0, 3, 7)>, <5, (0, 3, 8)>, <5, (0, 7, 8)>, <5, (2, 3, 7)>, <5, (2, 3, 8)>, <5, (2, 7, 8)>, <5, (3, 7, 8)>
  
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 4, 5, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - <7, (1, 3, 4)>, <7, (1, 3, 5)>, <7, (1, 3, 9)>, <7, (1, 4, 5)>, <7, (1, 4, 9)>, <7, (1, 5, 9)>, <7, (3, 4, 5)>, <7, (3, 4, 9)>, <7, (3, 5, 9)>, <7, (4, 5, 9)>
  
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3, 5} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - <8, (1, 2, 3)>, <8, (1, 2, 5)>, <8, (1, 3, 5)>, <8, (2, 3, 5)>
  
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 33

Therefore, there are a total of [33] 3-stars in your graph.
