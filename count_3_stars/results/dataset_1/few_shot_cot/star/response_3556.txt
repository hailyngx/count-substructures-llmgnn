Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 7} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 6} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: No neighbors
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 5**: No neighbors
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {3, 7} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2, 6} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {9} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
There are no nodes with 3 or more neighbors, hence no 3-stars can be formed in this graph.

Therefore, there are a total of [0] 3-stars in your graph.
