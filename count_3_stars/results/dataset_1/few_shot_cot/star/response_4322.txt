Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 6, 7, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - Possible 3-stars: <0, (1, 4, 6)>, <0, (1, 4, 7)>, <0, (1, 4, 9)>, <0, (1, 6, 7)>, <0, (1, 6, 9)>, <0, (1, 7, 9)>, <0, (4, 6, 7)>, <0, (4, 6, 9)>, <0, (4, 7, 9)>, <0, (6, 7, 9)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 6, 7, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - Possible 3-stars: <2, (3, 5, 6)>, <2, (3, 5, 7)>, <2, (3, 5, 9)>, <2, (3, 6, 7)>, <2, (3, 6, 9)>, <2, (3, 7, 9)>, <2, (5, 6, 7)>, <2, (5, 6, 9)>, <2, (5, 7, 9)>, <2, (6, 7, 9)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Possible 3-stars: <3, (1, 2, 7)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 6, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Possible 3-stars: <4, (0, 6, 7)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2, 6, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Possible 3-stars: <5, (2, 6, 9)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 4, 5} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Possible 3-stars: <6, (0, 2, 4)>, <6, (0, 2, 5)>, <6, (0, 4, 5)>, <6, (2, 4, 5)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 3, 4, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - Possible 3-stars: <7, (0, 2, 3)>, <7, (0, 2, 4)>, <7, (0, 2, 8)>, <7, (0, 3, 4)>, <7, (0, 3, 8)>, <7, (0, 4, 8)>, <7, (2, 3, 4)>, <7, (2, 3, 8)>, <7, (2, 4, 8)>, <7, (3, 4, 8)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Possible 3-stars: <9, (0, 2, 5)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 38

Therefore, there are a total of [38] 3-stars in your graph.
