Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 5

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 5, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 6, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 5, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 8: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 14

Therefore, there are a total of [14] 3-stars in your graph.
