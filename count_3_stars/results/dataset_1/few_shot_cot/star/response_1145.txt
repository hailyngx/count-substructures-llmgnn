Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 3

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 2} (2 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{2}{3}\) = 0
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 5, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - <1, (0, 2, 7)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 4, 5, 7, 8} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3}\) = 20
  - <2, (0, 1, 7)>, <2, (0, 5, 8)>, <2, (1, 4, 7)>, <2, (4, 5, 8)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {7, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{2}{3}\) = 0
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {2, 6, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - <4, (2, 6, 7)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - <5, (1, 2, 8)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - <6, (4, 7, 8)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3, 4, 6} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
  - <7, (1, 2, 4)>, <7, (1, 2, 6)>, <7, (1, 4, 6)>, <7, (2, 4, 6)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - <8, (2, 5, 6)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {3} (1 neighbor)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{1}{3}\) = 0

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 20
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 1
Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 20 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 38

Therefore, there are a total of [38] 3-stars in your graph.
