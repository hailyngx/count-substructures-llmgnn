Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 8} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 4} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 7} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 7} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 7, 8} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 7, 8} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 4, 6, 8} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 5, 6, 7} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 10
Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 31
Therefore, there are a total of [31] 3-stars in your graph.
