Node 3 is connected to node 1, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 5

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {6, 8} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 6} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
    - 3-Stars from Node 1: <1, (3, 4, 6)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 7} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
    - 3-Stars from Node 2: <2, (4, 5, 7)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 5, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
    - 3-Stars from Node 3: <3, (1, 5, 8)>, <3, (1, 5, 9)>, <3, (4, 5, 8)>, <3, (4, 5, 9)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 6} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
    - 3-Stars from Node 4: <4, (1, 2, 6)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 7, 8, 9} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
    - 3-Stars from Node 5: <5, (2, 3, 7)>, <5, (2, 3, 9)>, <5, (2, 8, 7)>, <5, (2, 8, 9)>, <5, (3, 7, 9)>, <5, (4, 7, 8)>, <5, (4, 7, 9)>, <5, (4, 8, 7)>, <5, (4, 8, 9)>, <5, (7, 8, 9)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 4} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
    - 3-Stars from Node 6: <6, (0, 1, 4)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2, 5} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 5} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
    - 3-Stars from Node 8: <8, (0, 3, 5)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {3, 5} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 8: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 19

Therefore, there are a total of [19] 3-stars in your graph.
