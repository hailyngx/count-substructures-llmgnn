Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 4

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - <0, (2, 4, 7)>

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 4, 6, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - <1, (2, 4, 9)>
  - <1, (2, 6, 9)>
  - <1, (3, 9, 4)>
  - <1, (3, 9, 6)>
  - <1, (4, 9, 6)>

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 5, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - <2, (0, 1, 8)>
  - <2, (0, 5, 8)>
  - <2, (1, 5, 8)>
  - <2, (1, 0, 8)>

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - <4, (0, 1, 9)>

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2, 6, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - <5, (2, 6, 8)>

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - <8, (2, 3, 5)>

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Adding up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 8: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 18

Therefore, there are a total of [18] 3-stars in your graph.
