Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list provided, we'll compute the number of 3-stars for each applicable node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star with less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star with less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star with less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {3} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star with less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {7, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star with less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {3, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star with less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 5, 6, 7, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3, 7, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Adding up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 = 22

Therefore, there are a total of [22] 3-stars in the provided graph.
