Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 8
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 3

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <0, (2, 4, 7)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <1, (2, 5, 7)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <2, (0, 1, 8)>, <2, (0, 1, 9)>, <2, (1, 8, 9)>, <2, (0, 8, 9)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {7, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <3, (7, 8, 9)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 5, 7, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <4, (0, 5, 7)>, <4, (0, 7, 8)>, <4, (5, 7, 8)>, <4, (0, 5, 8)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <5, (1, 4, 8)>
- **Node 6**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 3, 4, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - <7, (0, 1, 3)>, <7, (0, 1, 4)>, <7, (0, 1, 8)>, <7, (1, 3, 4)>, <7, (1, 3, 8)>, <7, (1, 4, 8)>, <7, (0, 3, 4)>, <7, (0, 3, 8)>, <7, (0, 4, 8)>, <7, (3, 4, 8)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 4, 5, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - <8, (2, 3, 4)>, <8, (2, 3, 5)>, <8, (2, 3, 7)>, <8, (2, 4, 5)>, <8, (2, 4, 7)>, <8, (2, 5, 7)>, <8, (3, 4, 5)>, <8, (3, 4, 7)>, <8, (3, 5, 7)>, <8, (4, 5, 7)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {2, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 = 32

Therefore, there are a total of [32] 3-stars in your graph.
