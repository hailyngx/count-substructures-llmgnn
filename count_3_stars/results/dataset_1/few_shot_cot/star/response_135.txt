Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 5
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 3

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 3} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 5, 9} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - 3-star: <1, (0, 5, 9)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {9} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 9} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 6, 8} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - 3-stars: <5, (1, 4, 6)>, <5, (1, 4, 8)>, <5, (1, 6, 8)>, <5, (4, 6, 8)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: No neighbors
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - 3-star: <9, (1, 2, 3)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6

Therefore, there are a total of [6] 3-stars in your graph. The unique 3-stars found are <1, (0, 5, 9)>, <5, (1, 4, 6)>, <5, (1, 4, 8)>, <5, (1, 6, 8)>, <5, (4, 6, 8)>, and <9, (1, 2, 3)>.
