Node 4 is connected to node 3, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 4, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {6, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {3, 6, 7, 8, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 = 41

Therefore, there are a total of [41] 3-stars in your graph.
