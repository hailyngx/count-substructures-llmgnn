Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Possible 3-star: <1, (0, 4, 9)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {7, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Possible 3-star: <3, (7, 8, 9)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {7, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Possible 3-star: <7, (3, 6, 8)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 6, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Possible 3-stars: 
    - <8, (2, 3, 9)>
    - <8, (3, 6, 9)>
    - <8, (6, 7, 9)>
    - <8, (3, 7, 9)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 4, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Possible 3-stars: 
    - <9, (1, 3, 8)>
    - <9, (3, 4, 8)>
    - <9, (1, 4, 8)>
    - <9, (1, 3, 4)>
  
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 11
Therefore, there are a total of [11] 3-stars in your graph.
