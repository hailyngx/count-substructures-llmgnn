Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 5, 8} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - Possible 3-star configurations: <0, (1, 5, 8)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 6, 7, 8} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - Possible 3-star configurations: <1, (0, 6, 8)>, <1, (0, 7, 8)>, <1, (6, 7, 8)>, <1, (0, 6, 7)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3, 5} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 7, 8, 9} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
    - Possible 3-star configurations: <3, (2, 5, 7)>, <3, (2, 7, 8)>, <3, (5, 7, 8)>, <3, (2, 5, 8)>, <3, (5, 8, 9)>, <3, (7, 8, 9)>, <3, (2, 7, 9)>, <3, (2, 5, 9)>, <3, (5, 7, 9)>, <3, (7, 8, 9)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {6, 8} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 3, 6, 7} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
    - Possible 3-star configurations: <5, (0, 2, 3)>, <5, (0, 3, 6)>, <5, (0, 3, 7)>, <5, (2, 3, 7)>, <5, (0, 6, 7)>, <5, (3, 6, 7)>, <5, (2, 5, 7)>, <5, (3, 5, 6)>, <5, (3, 5, 7)>, <5, (5, 6, 7)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 5, 7} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - Possible 3-star configurations: <6, (1, 5, 7)>, <6, (1, 5, 0)>, <6, (1, 7, 0)>, <6, (5, 7, 0)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 5, 6} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - Possible 3-star configurations: <7, (1, 3, 5)>, <7, (1, 5, 6)>, <7, (1, 3, 6)>, <7, (3, 5, 6)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 3, 4, 9} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
    - Possible 3-star configurations: <8, (0, 1, 3)>, <8, (0, 1, 9)>, <8, (0, 3, 4)>, <8, (0, 3, 9)>, <8, (0, 4, 9)>, <8, (1, 3, 4)>, <8, (1, 3, 9)>, <8, (1, 4, 9)>, <8, (3, 4, 9)>, <8, (1, 4, 3)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {3, 8} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 43

Therefore, there are a total of [43] 3-stars in your graph.
