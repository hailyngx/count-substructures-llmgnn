Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-star: <1, (4, 5, 6)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 6, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-stars: <3, (4, 5, 6)>, <3, (4, 5, 9)>, <3, (4, 6, 9)>, <3, (5, 6, 9)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 5, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-stars: <4, (1, 3, 5)>, <4, (1, 5, 8)>, <4, (3, 5, 8)>, <4, (5, 8, 1)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
  - 3-stars: <5, (1, 3, 4)>, <5, (1, 3, 8)>, <5, (1, 3, 9)>, <5, (1, 4, 8)>, <5, (1, 4, 9)>, <5, (1, 8, 9)>, <5, (3, 4, 8)>, <5, (3, 4, 9)>, <5, (3, 8, 9)>, <5, (4, 8, 1)>, <5, (4, 8, 3)>, <5, (4, 8, 5)>, <5, (4, 1, 3)>, <5, (4, 1, 9)>, <5, (4, 3, 5)>, <5, (4, 3, 9)>, <5, (4, 5, 9)>, <5, (8, 1, 9)>, <5, (8, 3, 4)>, <5, (8, 4, 1)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-star: <6, (1, 3, 8)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 5, 6, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - 3-stars: <8, (0, 4, 5)>, <8, (0, 4, 6)>, <8, (0, 5, 6)>, <8, (0, 5, 7)>, <8, (4, 5, 6)>, <8, (4, 5, 7)>, <8, (4, 6, 7)>, <8, (5, 6, 7)>, <8, (5, 6, 0)>, <8, (5, 6, 4)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {3, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 20
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 8: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 1 + 10 = 40

Therefore, there are a total of [40] 3-stars in your graph.
