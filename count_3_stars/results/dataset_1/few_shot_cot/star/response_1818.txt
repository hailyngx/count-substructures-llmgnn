Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-star: <1, (3, 8, 9)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {8, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2, 3, 5} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <8, (0, 1, 2)>, <8, (0, 1, 3)>, <8, (0, 1, 5)>, <8, (1, 2, 3)>, <8, (1, 2, 5)>, <8, (1, 3, 5)>, <8, (0, 2, 3)>, <8, (0, 2, 5)>, <8, (0, 3, 5)>, <8, (2, 3, 5)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 5, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-star: <9, (1, 5, 7)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 1 = 12

Therefore, there are a total of [12] 3-stars in your graph.
