Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {7, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-Star: <1, (7, 8, 9)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-Star: <3, (4, 6, 8)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {3, 6, 7, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-Star: <4, (3, 6, 8)>, <4, (6, 7, 8)>, <4, (3, 7, 8)>, <4, (3, 6, 7)>
- **Node 5**: Not connected to any nodes.
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 7, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-Star: <6, (3, 4, 8)>, <6, (4, 7, 8)>, <6, (3, 7, 8)>, <6, (3, 4, 7)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 4, 6, 8, 9} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
  - 3-Star: <7, (0, 1, 9)>, <7, (0, 4, 9)>, <7, (1, 4, 9)>, <7, (0, 6, 9)>, <7, (1, 6, 9)>, <7, (4, 6, 9)>, <7, (0, 8, 9)>, <7, (1, 8, 9)>, <7, (4, 8, 9)>, <7, (6, 8, 9)>, <7, (0, 1, 4)>, <7, (0, 1, 6)>, <7, (0, 4, 6)>, <7, (1, 4, 6)>, <7, (0, 1, 8)>, <7, (0, 4, 8)>, <7, (1, 4, 8)>, <7, (0, 6, 8)>, <7, (1, 6, 8)>, <7, (4, 6, 8)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 4, 6, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - 3-Star: <8, (1, 3, 7)>, <8, (1, 4, 7)>, <8, (3, 4, 7)>, <8, (1, 3, 4)>, <8, (1, 6, 7)>, <8, (3, 6, 7)>, <8, (4, 6, 7)>, <8, (1, 3, 6)>, <8, (1, 4, 6)>, <8, (3, 4, 6)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 20
- From Node 8: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 10 = 40

Therefore, there are a total of [40] 3-stars in your graph.
