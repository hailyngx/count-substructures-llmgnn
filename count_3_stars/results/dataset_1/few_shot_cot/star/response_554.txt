Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 6

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 4, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 1**: No Neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 6, 7, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 4, 5} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 5, 7, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {2, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 5, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 36

Therefore, there are a total of [36] 3-stars in your graph. This count represents how many unique 3-star subgraphs can be formed based on the adjacency list provided.
