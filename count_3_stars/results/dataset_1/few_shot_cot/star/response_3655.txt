Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 6, 7} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - 3-Star: <0, (1, 6, 7)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 9} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {6, 9} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4, 5} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {3, 7, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - 3-Star: <4, (3, 7, 9)>, <4, (7, 8, 9)>, <4, (3, 8, 9)>, <4, (3, 7, 8)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {3, 6, 9} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - 3-Star: <5, (3, 6, 9)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 5, 7, 9} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
    - 3-Star: <6, (0, 5, 9)>, <6, (2, 5, 9)>, <6, (7, 5, 9)>, <6, (0, 7, 9)>, <6, (0, 2, 9)>, <6, (2, 7, 9)>, <6, (0, 5, 7)>, <6, (2, 5, 7)>, <6, (0, 2, 5)>, <6, (0, 2, 7)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 6, 9} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - 3-Star: <7, (0, 6, 9)>, <7, (4, 6, 9)>, <7, (0, 4, 9)>, <7, (0, 6, 4)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7} (6 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
    - 3-Star: <9, (1, 2, 4)>, <9, (1, 2, 5)>, <9, (1, 2, 6)>, <9, (1, 2, 7)>, <9, (1, 4, 5)>, <9, (1, 4, 6)>, <9, (1, 4, 7)>, <9, (1, 5, 6)>, <9, (1, 5, 7)>, <9, (1, 6, 7)>, <9, (2, 4, 5)>, <9, (2, 4, 6)>, <9, (2, 4, 7)>, <9, (2, 5, 6)>, <9, (2, 5, 7)>, <9, (2, 6, 7)>, <9, (4, 5, 6)>, <9, (4, 5, 7)>, <9, (4, 6, 7)>, <9, (5, 6, 7)>
    
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 9: 20
Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 20 = 40

Therefore, there are a total of [40] 3-stars in your graph.
