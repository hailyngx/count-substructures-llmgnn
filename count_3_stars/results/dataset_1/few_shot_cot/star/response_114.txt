Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 10 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 7) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
  
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Total number of 3-stars = 0
Therefore, there are a total of [0] 3-stars in your graph.
