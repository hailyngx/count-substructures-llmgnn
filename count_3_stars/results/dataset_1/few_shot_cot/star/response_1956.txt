Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-stars from Node 0: <0, (4, 8, 9)>, <0, (4, 7, 9)>, <0, (7, 8, 9)>, <0, (4, 7, 8)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 6, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-stars from Node 1: <1, (2, 3, 6)>, <1, (2, 3, 8)>, <1, (2, 6, 8)>, <1, (3, 6, 8)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 7, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-star from Node 2: <2, (1, 7, 8)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-stars from Node 3: <3, (1, 4, 9)>, <3, (1, 8, 9)>, <3, (4, 8, 9)>, <3, (1, 4, 8)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 5, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-stars from Node 4: <4, (0, 5, 9)>, <4, (0, 3, 9)>, <4, (0, 3, 5)>, <4, (3, 5, 9)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {4, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-star from Node 6: <6, (1, 8, 9)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 2} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 9} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
  - 3-stars from Node 8: <8, (0, 1, 9)>, <8, (0, 2, 9)>, <8, (0, 3, 9)>, <8, (0, 6, 9)>, <8, (1, 2, 9)>, <8, (1, 3, 9)>, <8, (1, 6, 9)>, <8, (2, 3, 9)>, <8, (2, 6, 9)>, <8, (3, 6, 9)>, <8, (0, 1, 3)>, <8, (0, 1, 6)>, <8, (0, 2, 3)>, <8, (0, 2, 6)>, <8, (1, 2, 3)>, <8, (1, 2, 6)>, <8, (0, 3, 6)>, <8, (1, 3, 6)>, <8, (2, 3, 6)>, <8, (0, 1, 2)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 4, 6, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - 3-stars from Node 9: <9, (0, 4, 8)>, <9, (0, 3, 8)>, <9, (0, 6, 8)>, <9, (4, 3, 8)>, <9, (4, 6, 8)>, <9, (3, 6, 8)>, <9, (0, 3, 4)>, <9, (0, 3, 6)>, <9, (0, 4, 6)>, <9, (3, 4, 6)>

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 20 + 10 = 48

Therefore, there are a total of [48] 3-stars in your graph.
