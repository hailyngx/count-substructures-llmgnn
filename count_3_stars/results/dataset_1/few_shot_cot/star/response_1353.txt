Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 6

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {3, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 6, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 5, 6, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - 3-stars: <3, (0, 5, 6)>, <3, (0, 6, 9)>, <3, (5, 6, 9)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {6, 7, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {3, 6, 7, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - 3-stars: <5, (3, 6, 9)>, <5, (3, 6, 7)>, <5, (6, 7, 9)>, <5, (6, 9, 9)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9} (7 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{7}{3}\) = 35
  - 3-stars: <6, (0, 3, 9)>, <6, (0, 3, 5)>, <6, (0, 3, 6)>, <6, (0, 9, 5)>, <6, (0, 9, 6)>, 
  <6, (0, 5, 6)>, <6, (3, 5, 9)>, <6, (3, 6, 9)>, <6, (4, 5, 6)>, <6, (5, 7, 9)>, <6, (6, 8, 9)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 5, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - 3-stars: <9, (1, 3, 5)>, <9, (1, 3, 6)>, <9, (1, 5, 6)>, <9, (3, 5, 6)>

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 35 + 4 = 49

Therefore, there are a total of [49] 3-stars in your graph.
