Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 5, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 6, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 6, 7, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 4, 7, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 4**: No 3-stars can be formed as it has only 1 neighbor.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 6, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2, 5} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 7**: No 3-stars can be formed as it has only 1 neighbor.
- **Node 8**: No 3-stars can be formed as it has only 1 neighbor.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 5, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 40

Therefore, there are a total of [40] 3-stars in your graph.
