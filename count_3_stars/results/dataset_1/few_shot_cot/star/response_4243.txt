Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 7, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-Stars: <1, (3, 5, 7)>, <1, (3, 5, 9)>, <1, (3, 7, 9)>, <1, (5, 7, 9)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-Star: <3, (1, 4, 7)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-Star: <4, (2, 3, 5)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6

Therefore, there are a total of [6] 3-stars in your graph.
