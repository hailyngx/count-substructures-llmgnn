Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 5

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {6, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-Stars: <3, (4, 5, 6)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {3} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-Stars: <5, (1, 2, 3)>, <5, (1, 2, 9)>, <5, (1, 3, 9)>, <5, (2, 3, 9)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2, 3, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - 3-Stars: <6, (0, 1, 2)>, <6, (0, 1, 3)>, <6, (0, 1, 7)>, <6, (0, 2, 3)>, <6, (0, 2, 7)>, <6, (0, 3, 7)>, <6, (1, 2, 3)>, <6, (1, 2, 7)>, <6, (1, 3, 7)>, <6, (2, 3, 7)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 10 = 15

Therefore, there are a total of [15] 3-stars in your graph.
