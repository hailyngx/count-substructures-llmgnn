Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 3
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the provided graph, we will follow the same approach as the example given. 

Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 3, 7, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {3} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Not connected to any node.
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 4, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2, 4, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 26

Therefore, there are a total of [26] 3-stars in your graph.
