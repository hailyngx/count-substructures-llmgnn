Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 6, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - <0, (2, 5, 6)>
    - <0, (2, 5, 9)>
    - <0, (2, 6, 9)>
    - <0, (5, 6, 9)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 6, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - <1, (3, 6, 8)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 5, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - <2, (0, 5, 8)>
    - <2, (0, 6, 8)>
    - <2, (4, 5, 8)>
    - <2, (5, 3, 8)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 5, 6} (4 neighbors)

    - <5, (2, 3, 7)>
    - <5, (3, 6, 7)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 3, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - <6, (0, 1, 3)>
    - <6, (0, 3, 7)>
    - <6, (1, 3, 7)>
    - <6, (3, 5, 7)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 6, 8, 9} (5 neighbors)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
  - From Node 0: 4
  - From Node 1: 1
  - From Node 2: 4
  - From Node 3: 4
  - From Node 4: 10
  - From Node 5: 4
  - From Node 6: 4
  - From Node 7: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 41

Therefore, there are a total of [41] 3-stars in your graph.
