Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {4, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {6} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 6: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1

Therefore, there are a total of [1] 3-star in your graph.
