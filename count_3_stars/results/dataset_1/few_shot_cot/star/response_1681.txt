Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {6, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-star: <2, (0, 8, 9)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {6, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {3, 6, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-star: <5, (3, 6, 9)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 5, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-stars: 
    - <6, (1, 4, 5)>
    - <6, (1, 5, 7)>
    - <6, (4, 5, 7)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {6, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-star: <7, (6, 8, 9)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-star: <8, (0, 2, 7)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
  - Unique 3-stars:
    - <9, (1, 3, 5)>
    - <9, (1, 3, 6)>
    - <9, (1, 3, 9)>
    - <9, (1, 5, 7)>
    - <9, (1, 6, 7)>
    - <9, (1, 6, 9)>
    - <9, (1, 7, 9)>
    - <9, (3, 5, 9)>
    - <9, (3, 6, 9)>
    - <9, (3, 7, 9)>
    - <9, (4, 6, 9)>
    - <9, (4, 9, 7)>
    - <9, (5, 9, 7)>
    - <9, (6, 9, 7)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 20
Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 20 = 28
Therefore, there are a total of [28] 3-stars in your graph.
