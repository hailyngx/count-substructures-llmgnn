Node 9 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 5

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
        Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
        - **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
        - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
        - **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 6} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
        - **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9} (6 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
        - **Node 3**: Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor)
        - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
        - **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 9} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
        - **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 9} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
        - **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 2} (2 neighbors)
        - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
        - **Node 7**: Neighbors = {3} (1 neighbor)
        - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
        - **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
        - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
        - **Node 9**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 5} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
        
        Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
        Add up all the valid configurations:
        - From Node 1: 1
        - From Node 2: 20
        - From Node 4: 1
        - From Node 5: 1
        - From Node 9: 1
        Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 20 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 24
        
        Therefore, there are a total of [24] 3-stars in your graph.
