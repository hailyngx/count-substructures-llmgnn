Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {6} (1 neighbor)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 6, 9} (4 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  <1, (3, 4, 6)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3, 6, 9} (3 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  <2, (3, 6, 9)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 5, 6, 8, 9} (6 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
  <3, (1, 2, 6)>, <3, (1, 5, 6)>, <3, (1, 6, 9)>, <3, (2, 5, 6)>, <3, (2, 6, 9)>, <3, (5, 6, 8)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1} (1 neighbor)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {3, 6, 8} (3 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  <5, (3, 6, 8)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 9} (6 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
  <6, (0, 1, 3)>, <6, (0, 1, 6)>, <6, (0, 2, 6)>, <6, (1, 2, 3)>, <6, (1, 3, 5)>, <6, (1, 3, 9)>, <6, (1, 5, 6)>, <6, (1, 6, 9)>, <6, (2, 3, 6)>, <6, (2, 6, 9)>, <6, (3, 5, 8)>, <6, (3, 6, 9)>, <6, (5, 6, 8)>, <6, (5, 8, 3)>, <6, (5, 8, 7)>, <6, (8, 7, 5)>, <6, (8, 7, 3)>, <6, (9, 1, 6)>, <6, (9, 2, 6)>, <6, (9, 3, 6)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 7} (3 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  <8, (3, 5, 8)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3, 6} (4 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  <9, (1, 2, 6)>, <9, (1, 3, 6)>, <9, (2, 3, 6)>, <9, (3, 6, 1)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 20
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 20
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 20 + 1 + 20 + 1 + 4 = 51
Therefore, there are a total of [51] 3-stars in your graph.
