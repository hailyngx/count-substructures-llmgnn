Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 6

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 6, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 1**: No neighbors
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {6, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 6, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9} (7 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{7}{3} = 35\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 4, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 35
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 35 + 4 = 48
Therefore, there are a total of [48] 3-stars in your graph.
