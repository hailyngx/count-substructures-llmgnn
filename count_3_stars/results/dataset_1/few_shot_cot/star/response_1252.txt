Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 5

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {3, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 6, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3, 6, 7, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8} (8 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{8}{3} = 56 \)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {3, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3, 4} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 56
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 56 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 72

Therefore, there are a total of [72] 3-stars in your graph.
