Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 6, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-star configurations: <1, (4, 5, 6)>, <1, (4, 5, 9)>, <1, (4, 6, 9)>, <1, (5, 6, 9)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 6, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-star configuration: <4, (1, 6, 7)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-star configuration: <6, (1, 4, 8)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-star configuration: <7, (0, 4, 8)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {3, 6, 7, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-star configurations: <8, (3, 6, 7)>, <8, (3, 6, 9)>, <8, (3, 7, 9)>, <8, (6, 7, 9)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 11
Therefore, there are a total of [11] 3-stars in your graph.
