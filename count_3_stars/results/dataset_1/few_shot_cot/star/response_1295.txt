Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 5) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 4

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {3, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 = 2
Therefore, there are a total of [2] 3-stars in your graph.
