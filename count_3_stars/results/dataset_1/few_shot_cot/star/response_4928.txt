Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  3-stars from Node 0: <0, (1, 3, 8)>, <0, (1, 3, 9)>, <0, (1, 8, 9)>, <0, (3, 8, 9)>
  
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
  3-stars from Node 1: <1, (0, 2, 3)>, <1, (0, 2, 4)>, <1, (0, 2, 8)>, <1, (0, 2, 9)>, <1, (0, 3, 4)>, <1, (0, 3, 8)>, <1, (0, 3, 9)>, <1, (0, 4, 8)>, <1, (0, 4, 9)>, <1, (0, 8, 9)>, <1, (2, 3, 4)>, <1, (2, 3, 8)>, <1, (2, 3, 9)>, <1, (2, 4, 8)>, <1, (2, 4, 9)>, <1, (2, 8, 9)>, <1, (3, 4, 8)>, <1, (3, 4, 9)>, <1, (3, 8, 9)>, <1, (4, 8, 9)>

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 5, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  3-stars from Node 2: <2, (1, 4, 5)>, <2, (1, 4, 7)>, <2, (1, 5, 7)>, <2, (4, 5, 7)>

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 4, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  3-stars from Node 3: <3, (0, 1, 4)>, <3, (0, 1, 7)>, <3, (0, 4, 7)>, <3, (1, 4, 7)>

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  3-stars from Node 4: <4, (1, 2, 3)>, <4, (1, 2, 7)>, <4, (1, 3, 7)>, <4, (2, 3, 7)>

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 4, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  3-stars from Node 7: <7, (2, 3, 4)>, <7, (2, 3, 9)>, <7, (2, 4, 9)>, <7, (3, 4, 9)>

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 1} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  3-star from Node 9: <9, (0, 1, 7)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Adding up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 20
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 41

Therefore, there are a total of [41] 3-stars in your graph.
