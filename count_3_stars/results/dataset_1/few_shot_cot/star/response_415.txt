Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 8} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 3} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 4, 7, 8} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 6, 9} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {3, 7, 9} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2, 6} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 9} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 6, 8} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 17
Therefore, there are a total of [17] 3-stars in your graph.
