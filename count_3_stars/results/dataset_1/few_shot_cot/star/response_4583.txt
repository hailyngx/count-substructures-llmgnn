Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 4

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the provided graph, we need to determine the number of 3-star configurations for each node that has three or more neighbors. If a node has exactly three neighbors, it can form one 3-star. If it has more than three neighbors, we calculate the number of ways to choose 3 neighbors to form a 3-star. Nodes with less than three neighbors cannot form a 3-star.

Given the adjacency list provided, let's analyze each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 4, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 6, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 2} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 10

Therefore, there are a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
