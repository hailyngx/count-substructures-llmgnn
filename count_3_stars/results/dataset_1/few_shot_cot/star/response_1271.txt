Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 1

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - Possible 3-stars: <1, (4, 7, 8)>, <1, (4, 7, 9)>, <1, (4, 8, 9)>, <1, (7, 8, 9)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - Possible 3-star: <2, (3, 5, 7)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - Possible 3-star: <3, (2, 4, 8)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - Possible 3-star: <4, (1, 3, 7)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2, 6, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - Possible 3-star: <5, (2, 6, 8)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - Possible 3-star: <7, (1, 2, 4)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 3, 5} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - Possible 3-stars: <8, (0, 1, 3)>, <8, (0, 1, 5)>, <8, (0, 3, 5)>, <8, (1, 3, 5)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 13

Therefore, there are a total of [13] 3-stars in your graph. This count represents how many unique 3-star subgraphs can be formed based on the adjacency list provided.
