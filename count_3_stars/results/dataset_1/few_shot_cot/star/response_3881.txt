Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 2

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 7} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 1**: No neighbors
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 7, 9} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 3**: No neighbors
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 7} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2, 7} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 7} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 4, 5, 6} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 8**: No neighbors
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 7: 10
Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 = 16
Therefore, there are a total of [16] 3-stars in your graph.
