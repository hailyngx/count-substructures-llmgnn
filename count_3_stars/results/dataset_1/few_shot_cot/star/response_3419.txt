Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {6} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {6, 7} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4, 8} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 5} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - 3-star: <4, (2, 3, 5)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {4, 7} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 7, 9} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - 3-stars: <6, (0, 1, 7)>, <6, (0, 7, 9)>, <6, (1, 7, 9)>, <6, (0, 1, 9)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 5, 6, 8} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - 3-stars: <7, (1, 5, 6)>, <7, (1, 6, 8)>, <7, (5, 6, 8)>, <7, (1, 5, 8)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {3, 7} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {6} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 4
Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 = 9
Therefore, there are a total of [9] 3-stars in your graph.
