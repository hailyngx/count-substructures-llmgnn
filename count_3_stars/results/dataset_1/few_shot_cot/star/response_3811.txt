Node 9 is connected to node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3, 6, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - Possible 3-stars:
    - <0, (1, 2, 3)>
    - <0, (1, 2, 6)>
    - <0, (1, 2, 7)>
    - <0, (1, 3, 6)>
    - <0, (1, 3, 7)>
    - <0, (1, 6, 7)>
    - <0, (2, 3, 6)>
    - <0, (2, 3, 7)>
    - <0, (2, 6, 7)>
    - <0, (3, 6, 7)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 5, 6, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Possible 3-stars:
    - <3, (0, 5, 6)>
    - <3, (0, 5, 7)>
    - <3, (0, 6, 7)>
    - <3, (5, 6, 7)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Possible 3-star: <6, (0, 3, 7)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 4, 6, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - Possible 3-stars:
    - <7, (0, 3, 4)>
    - <7, (0, 3, 6)>
    - <7, (0, 3, 9)>
    - <7, (0, 4, 6)>
    - <7, (0, 4, 9)>
    - <7, (0, 6, 9)>
    - <7, (3, 4, 6)>
    - <7, (3, 4, 9)>
    - <7, (3, 6, 9)>
    - <7, (4, 6, 9)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10 3-stars
- From Node 3: 4 3-stars
- From Node 6: 1 3-star
- From Node 7: 10 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 1 + 10 = 25

Therefore, there are a total of [25] 3-stars in your graph.
