Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 9} (3 neighbors)
   - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
   - 3-Star: <0, (2, 5, 9)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 7} (3 neighbors)
   - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
   - 3-Star: <1, (4, 5, 7)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 8} (2 neighbors)
   - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 8} (3 neighbors)
   - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
   - 3-Star: <3, (4, 6, 8)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 5} (3 neighbors)
   - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
   - 3-Star: <4, (1, 3, 5)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 4, 9} (4 neighbors)
   - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   - 3-Stars: 
      - <5, (0, 1, 4)>
      - <5, (0, 4, 9)>
      - <5, (1, 4, 9)>
      - <5, (0, 1, 9)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {3} (1 neighbor)
   - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1} (1 neighbor)
   - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 9} (3 neighbors)
   - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
   - 3-Star: <8, (2, 3, 9)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 5, 8} (3 neighbors)
   - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
   - 3-Star: <9, (0, 5, 8)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 10

Therefore, there are a total of [10] 3-stars in your graph.
