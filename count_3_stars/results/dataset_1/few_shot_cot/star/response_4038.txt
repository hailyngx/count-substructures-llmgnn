Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 6

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 5, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  <1, (0, 5, 7)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 6, 7, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  <3, (4, 5, 6)>, <3, (4, 5, 7)>, <3, (4, 6, 7)>, <3, (5, 6, 7)>, <3, (5, 6, 9)>, <3, (5, 7, 9)>, <3, (6, 7, 9)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  <4, (3, 5, 8)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3, 4} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  <5, (1, 3, 4)>, <5, (1, 3, 5)>, <5, (1, 4, 5)>, <5, (3, 4, 5)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {3, 7, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  <6, (3, 7, 9)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  <7, (1, 3, 6)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  <9, (2, 3, 6)>
  
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 19

Therefore, there are a total of [19] 3-stars in your graph.
