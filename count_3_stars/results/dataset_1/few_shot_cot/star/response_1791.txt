Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 6

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 7, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - 3-Stars from Node 0: <0, (2, 7, 8)>

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - 3-Stars from Node 2: <2, (0, 3, 9)>

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 4, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - 3-Stars from Node 3: <3, (1, 2, 4)>, <3, (1, 2, 7)>, <3, (1, 4, 7)>, <3, (2, 4, 7)>

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {3, 7, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - 3-Stars from Node 4: <4, (3, 7, 9)>

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {6} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - 3-Stars from Node 7: <7, (0, 3, 4)>

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - 3-Stars from Node 9: <9, (2, 4, 6)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Adding up all the valid 3-stars configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 9

Therefore, there are a total of [9] 3-stars in your graph.
