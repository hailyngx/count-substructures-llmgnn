Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\) 
  - <0, (2, 4, 5)>, <0, (2, 4, 6)>, <0, (2, 4, 8)>, <0, (2, 5, 6)>, <0, (2, 5, 8)>, <0, (2, 6, 8)>, <0, (4, 5, 6)>, <0, (4, 5, 8)>, <0, (4, 6, 8)>, <0, (5, 6, 8)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 5, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 
  - <2, (0, 4, 5)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {6, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 
  - <3, (6, 8, 9)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 5, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 
  - <4, (0, 2, 5)>, <4, (0, 5, 9)>, <4, (2, 5, 9)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2, 4, 6} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 
  - <5, (0, 2, 4)>, <5, (0, 2, 6)>, <5, (0, 4, 6)>, <5, (2, 4, 6)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 
  - <6, (0, 3, 5)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 
  - <8, (0, 3, 7)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 
  - <9, (2, 3, 4)>
  
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 20
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 42

Therefore, there are a total of [42] 3-stars in your graph.
