Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 7, 8, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - <2, (3, 4, 7)>, <2, (3, 4, 8)>, <2, (3, 4, 9)>, <2, (3, 7, 8)>, <2, (3, 7, 9)>, <2, (3, 8, 9)>, <2, (4, 7, 8)>, <2, (4, 7, 9)>, <2, (4, 8, 9)>, <2, (7, 8, 9)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 6, 7, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
  - <4, (0, 2, 3)>, <4, (0, 2, 5)>, <4, (0, 2, 6)>, <4, (0, 2, 8)>, <4, (0, 3, 5)>, <4, (0, 3, 6)>, <4, (0, 3, 8)>, <4, (0, 5, 6)>, <4, (0, 5, 8)>, <4, (0, 6, 8)>, <4, (2, 3, 5)>, <4, (2, 3, 6)>, <4, (2, 3, 8)>, <4, (2, 5, 6)>, <4, (2, 5, 8)>, <4, (2, 6, 8)>, <4, (3, 5, 6)>, <4, (3, 5, 8)>, <4, (3, 6, 8)>, <4, (5, 6, 8)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {4, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 5, 8, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - <6, (3, 4, 5)>, <6, (3, 4, 8)>, <6, (3, 4, 9)>, <6, (3, 5, 8)>, <6, (3, 5, 9)>, <6, (3, 8, 9)>, <6, (4, 5, 8)>, <6, (4, 5, 9)>, <6, (4, 8, 9)>, <6, (5, 8, 9)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <7, (1, 2, 3)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 4, 6, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - <8, (2, 3, 4)>, <8, (2, 3, 6)>, <8, (2, 3, 9)>, <8, (2, 4, 6)>, <8, (2, 4, 9)>, <8, (2, 6, 9)>, <8, (3, 4, 6)>, <8, (3, 4, 9)>, <8, (3, 6, 9)>, <8, (4, 6, 9)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {2, 6, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <9, (2, 6, 8)>

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 20 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 53

Therefore, there are a total of [53] 3-stars in your graph.
