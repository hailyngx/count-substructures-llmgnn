Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 6

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 4, 5} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {6} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 5, 7, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 4, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {4, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 21

Therefore, there are a total of [21] 3-stars in your graph.
