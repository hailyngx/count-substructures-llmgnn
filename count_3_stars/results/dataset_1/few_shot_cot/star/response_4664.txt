Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 9} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 7} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3, 6} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 5, 6, 7} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 8} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 3, 4} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 3} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 4, 8} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 9} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 8} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 23

Therefore, there are a total of [23] 3-stars in your graph.
