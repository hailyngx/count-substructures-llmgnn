Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 5, and node 6

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {6, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {6, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 6, 7, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{5}{3} = 10\)   <0, (2, 4, 6)> 
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 5, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)   <1, (4, 5, 9)>  
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 4, 5, 6} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{5}{3} = 10\)   <4, (1, 5, 6)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 9: 10
Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 26

Therefore, there are a total of [26] 3-stars in your graph.
