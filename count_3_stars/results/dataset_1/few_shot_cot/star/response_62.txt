Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = { 3, 4, 5, 7, 9 } (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = { 5, 6, 7, 8 } (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = { 5 } (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = { 0 } (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = { 0, 5, 6 } (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = { 0, 1, 2, 4, 7, 8 } (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = { 1, 4, 9 } (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = { 0, 1, 5, 8 } (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = { 1, 5, 7, 9 } (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = { 0, 6, 8 } (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 20
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 1 + 20 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 45

Therefore, there are a total of [45] 3-stars in your graph.
