Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 10 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (5, 2) (6, 2) (8, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 2
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 2
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:

- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 1**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 5, 6, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - Unique 3-stars: <2, (0, 3, 5)>, <2, (0, 3, 6)>, <2, (0, 3, 8)>, <2, (0, 5, 6)>, <2, (0, 5, 8)>, <2, (0, 6, 8)>, <2, (3, 5, 6)>, <2, (3, 5, 8)>, <2, (3, 6, 8)>, <2, (5, 6, 8)>

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 4**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 7**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 9**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 2: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 10

Therefore, there are a total of [10] 3-stars in your graph.
