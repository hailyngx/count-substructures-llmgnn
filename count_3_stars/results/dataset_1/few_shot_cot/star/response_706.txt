Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 1) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 6

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 7, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - **Unique 3-Stars**: <1, (3, 4, 7)>, <1, (3, 4, 8)>, <1, (3, 7, 8)>, <1, (4, 7, 8)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - **Unique 3-Stars**: <4, (1, 3, 6)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {6} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - **Unique 3-Stars**: <6, (4, 5, 9)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {6} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 6: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6

Therefore, there are a total of [6] 3-stars in your graph.
