Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 6

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 6} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 6, 9} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( {'4 \choose 3'} = 4\)
  
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4, 8} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {7, 9} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 6, 7, 8, 9} (6 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( {'6 \choose 3'} = 20\)
  
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 6} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( {'3 \choose 3'} = 1\)
  
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 4, 5, 8, 9} (6 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( {'6 \choose 3'} = 20\)
  
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {3, 4} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 6} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( {'3 \choose 3'} = 1\)
  
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 4, 6} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( {'4 \choose 3'} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 20
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 20 + 1 + 4 = 30

Therefore, there are a total of [30] 3-stars in your graph.
