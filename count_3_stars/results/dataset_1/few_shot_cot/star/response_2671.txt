Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: No neighbors. Cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 7} (2 neighbors). Cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3, 5} (2 neighbors). Cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 4, 6, 9} (5 neighbors).
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
    - Possible 3-stars: <3, (1, 2, 4)>, <3, (1, 2, 6)>, <3, (1, 4, 6)>, <3, (1, 4, 9)>, <3, (2, 4, 6)>, <3, (2, 4, 9)>, <3, (2, 6, 9)>, <3, (4, 6, 9)>, <1, 3, 9)>, <3, (2, 6, 9)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 6, 9} (4 neighbors).
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - Possible 3-stars: <4, (3, 5, 6)>, <4, (3, 5, 9)>, <4, (3, 6, 9)>, <4, (5, 6, 9)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 8} (3 neighbors).
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - Possible 3-star: <5, (2, 4, 8)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {3, 4} (2 neighbors). Cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 8} (2 neighbors). Cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 9} (3 neighbors).
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - Possible 3-star: <8, (5, 7, 9)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 8} (3 neighbors).
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - Possible 3-star: <9, (3, 4, 8)>

Total Number of 3-Stars = 10 (from Node 3) + 4 (from Node 4) + 1 (from Node 5) + 1 (from Node 8) + 1 (from Node 9) = 17

Therefore, there are a total of [17] 3-stars in your graph.
