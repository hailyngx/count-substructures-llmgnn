Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
        Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
        - **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 7, 8, 9} (5 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
        - **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 8} (2 neighbors)
        - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
        - **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 7} (2 neighbors)
        - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
        - **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 5, 6, 9} (5 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
        - **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9} (5 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
        - **Node 5**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
        - **Node 6**: Neighbors = {3, 7} (2 neighbors)
        - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
        - **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 4, 6} (4 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
        - **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 5} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
        - **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 4, 5} (4 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
        
        Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
        Add up all the valid configurations:
        - From Node 0: 10
        - From Node 3: 10
        - From Node 4: 10
        - From Node 5: 4
        - From Node 7: 4
        - From Node 8: 1
        - From Node 9: 4
        Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 43
        Therefore, there are a total of [43] 3-stars in your graph. This count represents how many unique 3-star subgraphs can be formed based on the adjacency list provided.
