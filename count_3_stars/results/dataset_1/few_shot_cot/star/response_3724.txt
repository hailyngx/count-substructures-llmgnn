Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: No neighbors, cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 1**: No neighbors, cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3, 7, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {3} (1 neighbor), cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {3, 6} (2 neighbors), cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor), cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {3, 7} (2 neighbors), cannot form a 3-star.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Adding up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 20
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 20 + 4 + 1 = 26

Therefore, there are a total of [26] 3-stars in your graph.
