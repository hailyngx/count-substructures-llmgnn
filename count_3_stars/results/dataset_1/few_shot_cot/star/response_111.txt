Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: No neighbors.
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <1, (3, 5, 9)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 5, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <3, (1, 5, 7)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {2, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {2, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {3, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbor = {9} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 6, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <9, (1, 6, 8)>
  
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3

Therefore, there are a total of [3] 3-stars in your graph.
