Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {6, 7} (2 neighbors)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  <1, (2, 5, 8)>
  <1, (2, 5, 9)>
  <1, (2, 8, 9)>
  <1, (5, 8, 9)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1} (1 neighbor)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 8} (3 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  <3, (5, 6, 8)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {9} (1 neighbor)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 3} (2 neighbors)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 3} (2 neighbors)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 9} (2 neighbors)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 3} (2 neighbors)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 7} (3 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  <9, (1, 4, 7)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6
Therefore, there are a total of [6] 3-stars in your graph.
