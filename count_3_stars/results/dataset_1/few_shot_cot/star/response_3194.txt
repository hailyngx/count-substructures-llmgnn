Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 5, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - <0, (1, 5, 6)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 6, 7, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - <2, (3, 4, 9)>, <2, (3, 6, 7)>, <2, (4, 6, 7)>, <2, (4, 6, 9)>, <2, (6, 7, 9)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 7, 8, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - <3, (2, 5, 9)>, <3, (2, 7, 9)>, <3, (5, 7, 8)>, <3, (5, 7, 9)>, <3, (7, 8, 9)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 6, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - <4, (1, 2, 6)>, <4, (1, 2, 7)>, <4, (2, 6, 7)>, <4, (6, 7, 9)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 7, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - <5, (0, 3, 7)>, <5, (0, 3, 8)>, <5, (3, 7, 8)>, <5, (7, 8, 9)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 4, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - <6, (0, 2, 4)>, <6, (0, 2, 8)>, <6, (2, 4, 7)>, <6, (4, 7, 8)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 4, 5} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - <7, (2, 3, 4)>, <7, (2, 4, 5)>, <7, (2, 5, 3)>, <7, (3, 4, 5)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - <8, (3, 5, 6)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {2, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 2: 5 (10 unique configurations)
- From Node 3: 5 (10 unique configurations)
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 5 + 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 28

Therefore, there are a total of [28] 3-stars in the given graph.
