Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 4

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 5, 6, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 6, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {6, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 6, 7, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2, 3} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 3, 4} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 20

Therefore, there are a total of [20] 3-stars in your graph.
