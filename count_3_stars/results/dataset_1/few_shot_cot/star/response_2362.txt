Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 9

Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 5, and node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 6, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - 3-star: <0, (1, 6, 9)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 5, 6, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
  - 3-stars: <3, (2, 5, 9)>, <3, (2, 6, 9)>, <3, (4, 5, 9)>, <3, (4, 6, 9)>, <3, (5, 6, 9)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - 3-star: <4, (1, 3, 9)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3}\) = 20
  - 3-stars: <5, (2, 6, 9)>, <5, (2, 7, 9)>, <5, (2, 8, 9)>, <5, (3, 6, 9)>, <5, (3, 7, 9)>, <5, (3, 8, 9)>, <5, (6, 7, 9)>, <5, (6, 8, 9)>, <5, (7, 8, 9)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - 3-star: <6, (0, 3, 5)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 4, 5, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
  - 3-stars: <9, (0, 3, 5)>, <9, (0, 4, 5)>, <9, (0, 5, 7)>, <9, (3, 4, 5)>, <9, (3, 5, 7)>
    
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 20
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 9: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 1 + 20 + 1 + 10 = 43

Therefore, there are a total of [43] 3-stars in your graph.
