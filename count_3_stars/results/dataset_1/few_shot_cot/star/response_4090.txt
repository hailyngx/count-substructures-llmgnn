Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {9} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 6, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <2, (3, 4, 6)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2, 7, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <3, (2, 7, 9)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {6, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 7, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <6, (2, 5, 7)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 6, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <7, (3, 5, 6)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <9, (0, 3, 7)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5

Therefore, there are a total of [5] 3-stars in your graph.
