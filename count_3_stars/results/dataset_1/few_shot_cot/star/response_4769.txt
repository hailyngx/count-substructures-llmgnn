Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list provided, let's calculate the number of 3-star configurations for each node:

- **Node 0**: No neighbors, cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 4, 6, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - Possible 3-stars:
    - <1, (2, 4, 6)>
    - <1, (2, 4, 7)>
    - <1, (2, 6, 7)>
    - <1, (4, 6, 7)>
    - <1, (2, 6, 9)>
    - <1, (5, 6, 7)>
    - <1, (4, 5, 7)>
    - <1, (6, 7, 9)>
    - <1, (5, 7, 8)>
    - <1, (6, 7, 5)>

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 5, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Possible 3-stars:
    - <2, (1, 3, 5)>
    - <2, (1, 3, 7)>
    - <2, (1, 5, 7)>
    - <2, (3, 5, 7)>

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 2} (2 neighbors), cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 6, 7} (3 neighbors), cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2, 6, 7, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Possible 3-stars:
    - <5, (2, 6, 7)>
    - <5, (2, 6, 8)>
    - <5, (2, 7, 8)>
    - <5, (6, 7, 8)>

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 5, 7, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - Possible 3-stars:
    - <6, (1, 5, 7)>
    - <6, (1, 4, 7)>
    - <6, (1, 7, 9)>
    - <6, (1, 5, 9)>
    - <6, (4, 5, 7)>
    - <6, (5, 7, 9)>
    - <6, (4, 7, 9)>
    - <6, (1, 5, 4)>
    - <6, (1, 7, 4)>
    - <6, (1, 9, 4)>

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 4, 5, 6} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - Possible 3-stars:
    - <7, (1, 2, 5)>
    - <7, (1, 2, 6)>
    - <7, (1, 2, 4)>
    - <7, (2, 4, 6)>
    - <7, (1, 4, 6)>
    - <7, (1, 6, 5)>
    - <7, (1, 5, 4)>
    - <7, (4, 6, 5)>
    - <7, (1, 6, 9)>
    - <7, (5, 6, 8)>

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5, 9} (2 neighbors), cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {6, 8} (2 neighbors), cannot form a 3-star.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Adding all the valid 3-star configurations:
From Node 1: 10
From Node 2: 4
From Node 5: 4
From Node 6: 10
From Node 7: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 38

Therefore, there are a total of [38] 3-stars in your graph.
