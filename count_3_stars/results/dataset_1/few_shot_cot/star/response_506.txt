Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 6, 7, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <4, (0, 6, 7)>, <4, (0, 7, 8)>, <4, (6, 7, 8)>, <4, (0, 6, 8)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {8, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <6, (3, 4, 7)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 6, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <7, (0, 4, 6)>, <7, (0, 4, 8)>, <7, (4, 6, 8)>, <7, (0, 6, 8)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 5, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <8, (2, 4, 7)>, <8, (2, 4, 5)>, <8, (2, 5, 7)>, <8, (4, 5, 7)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 4
Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 13

Therefore, there are a total of [13] 3-stars in your graph.
