Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 3

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: No neighbors, cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 6} (2 neighbors), cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {6, 8} (2 neighbors), cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 7, 9} (4 neighbors).
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-Stars: <3, (1, 4, 7)>, <3, (1, 4, 9)>, <3, (1, 7, 9)>, <3, (4, 7, 9)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {3, 6} (2 neighbors), cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor), cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 4} (3 neighbors).
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-Star: <6, (1, 2, 4)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {3, 5} (2 neighbors), cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor), cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {3} (1 neighbor), cannot form a 3-star.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Adding all the valid configurations:
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 6: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 = 5

Therefore, there are a total of [5] 3-stars in your graph.
