Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 2} (2 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{2}{3}\) = 0
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 6, 8, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
  - 3-star configurations: 
    - <2, (0, 6, 8)>
    - <2, (0, 6, 9)>
    - <2, (4, 6, 8)>
    - <2, (4, 6, 9)>
    - <2, (0, 4, 8)>
    - <2, (0, 4, 9)>
    - <2, (0, 8, 9)>
    - <2, (4, 8, 9)>
    - <2, (6, 8, 9)>
    - <2, (0, 6, 4)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {7, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {2, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {3, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - 3-star configuration: 
    - <7, (3, 8, 9)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 6, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - 3-star configurations:
    - <8, (2, 6, 7)>
    - <8, (2, 3, 7)>
    - <8, (2, 6, 3)>
    - <8, (6, 3, 7)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - 3-star configuration:
    - <9, (2, 7, 5)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Total number of 3-stars = 0 + 10 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 16

Therefore, there are a total of [16] 3-stars in your graph.
