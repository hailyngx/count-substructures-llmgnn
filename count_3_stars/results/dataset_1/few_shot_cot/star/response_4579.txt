Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 6

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {7, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - 3-Stars: <4, (1, 2, 3)>, <4, (1, 2, 7)>, <4, (1, 3, 7)>, <4, (2, 3, 7)>
  
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 8**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
  
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 5, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - 3-Stars: <9, (0, 2, 5)>, <9, (0, 2, 6)>, <9, (0, 5, 6)>, <9, (2, 5, 6)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 = 8

Therefore, there are a total of [8] 3-stars in your graph.
