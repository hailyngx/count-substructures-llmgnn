Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 5

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: No neighbors.
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 6, 7, 8} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 8} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 5, 7, 8} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 8} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 4, 6, 9} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 5, 7} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 6} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3, 4} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 35

Therefore, there are a total of [35] 3-stars in your graph.
