Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 8) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Found 3-star: <5, (0, 3, 9)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 7, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Found 3-stars: <8, (1, 2, 7)>, <8, (1, 2, 9)>, <8, (1, 7, 9)>, <8, (2, 7, 9)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 6, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Found 3-stars: <9, (3, 5, 6)>, <9, (3, 5, 8)>, <9, (3, 6, 8)>, <9, (5, 6, 8)>
  
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 = 9

Therefore, there are a total of [9] 3-stars in your graph.
