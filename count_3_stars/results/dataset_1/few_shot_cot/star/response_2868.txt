Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will apply the same methodology as described in the example for each node that has three or more neighbors. We will calculate the number of unique 3-star configurations for each applicable node. Here's the breakdown:

- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 1**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3, 6, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-star: <2, (3, 6, 7)>

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2, 7, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-star: <3, (2, 7, 8)>

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 6, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-star: <5, (0, 6, 8)>

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <6, (2, 5, 8)>, <6, (2, 8, 9)>, <6, (5, 8, 9)>

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-star: <7, (2, 3, 4)>

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 5, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <8, (3, 4, 5)>, <8, (3, 5, 6)>, <8, (4, 5, 6)>, <8, (5, 6, 3)>

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {6} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 12

Therefore, there are a total of [12] 3-stars in your graph.
