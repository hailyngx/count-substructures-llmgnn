Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 5

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 1} (2 neighbors)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 8} (3 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
  <3, (5, 7, 8)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {9} (1 neighbor)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {3, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
  <5, (3, 8, 9)>
- **Node 6**: No neighbors
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {3} (1 neighbor)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {3, 5} (2 neighbors)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {4, 5} (2 neighbors)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 5: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 = 2
Therefore, there are a total of [2] 3-stars in your graph.
