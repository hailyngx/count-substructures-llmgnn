Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 6, 7, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - The 3-stars from Node 3:
    - <3, (1, 4, 6)>
    - <3, (1, 4, 7)>
    - <3, (1, 4, 8)>
    - <3, (1, 6, 7)>
    - <3, (1, 6, 8)>
    - <3, (1, 7, 8)>
    - <3, (4, 6, 7)>
    - <3, (4, 6, 8)>
    - <3, (4, 7, 8)>
    - <3, (6, 7, 8)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - The 3-stars from Node 4:
    - <4, (0, 3, 8)>
- **Node 5**: Not connected to any nodes.
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
  - The 3-stars from Node 6:
    - <6, (0, 2, 3)>
    - <6, (0, 2, 7)>
    - <6, (0, 2, 8)>
    - <6, (0, 2, 9)>
    - <6, (0, 3, 7)>
    - <6, (0, 3, 8)>
    - <6, (0, 3, 9)>
    - <6, (0, 7, 8)>
    - <6, (0, 7, 9)>
    - <6, (0, 8, 9)>
    - <6, (2, 3, 7)>
    - <6, (2, 3, 8)>
    - <6, (2, 3, 9)>
    - <6, (2, 7, 8)>
    - <6, (2, 7, 9)>
    - <6, (2, 8, 9)>
    - <6, (3, 7, 8)>
    - <6, (3, 7, 9)>
    - <6, (3, 8, 9)>
    - <6, (7, 8, 9)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {3, 6, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - The 3-stars from Node 7:
    - <7, (3, 6, 8)>
    - <7, (3, 6, 9)>
    - <7, (3, 8, 9)>
    - <7, (6, 8, 9)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 6, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - The 3-stars from Node 8:
    - <8, (3, 4, 6)>
    - <8, (3, 4, 7)>
    - <8, (3, 6, 7)>
    - <8, (4, 6, 7)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {6, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 6: 20
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 20 + 4 + 4 = 39

Therefore, there are a total of [39] 3-stars in your graph.
