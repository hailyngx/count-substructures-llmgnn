Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 5, 8} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - 3-stars: <0, (1, 5, 8)>, <0, (1, 3, 8)>, <0, (1, 5, 3)>, <0, (5, 3, 8)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 4, 7, 8, 9} (6 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
    - 3-stars: <1, (0, 4, 7)>, <1, (0, 7, 8)>, <1, (0, 7, 9)>, <1, (2, 4, 7)>, <1, (2, 7, 8)>, <1, (2, 7, 9)>, <1, (4, 6, 7)>, <1, (4, 7, 8)>, <1, (4, 7, 9)>, <1, (7, 8, 9)>, and more.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 5, 6, 7} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - 3-stars: <2, (1, 6, 7)>, <2, (1, 7, 8)>, <2, (1, 5, 7)>, <2, (5, 6, 7)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 6} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 6, 7} (3 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - 3-stars: <5, (0, 8, 9)>, <5, (2, 8, 9)>, <5, (0, 2, 9)>, <5, (0, 2, 8)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 4} (3 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 4, 8} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - 3-stars: <7, (1, 4, 8)>, <7, (1, 4, 9)>, <7, (1, 2, 8)>, <7, (2, 4, 8)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 5, 7, 9} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
    - 3-stars: <8, (0, 1, 5)>, <8, (0, 5, 9)>, <8, (1, 5, 9)>, <8, (1, 7, 9)>, <8, (5, 7, 9)>, and more.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 5, 8} (3 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 20
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 46

Therefore, there are a total of [46] 3-stars in your graph.
