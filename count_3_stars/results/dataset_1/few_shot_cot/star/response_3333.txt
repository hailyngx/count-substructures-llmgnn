Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 9
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 6

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {9} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Not connected to any nodes.
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 3**: Not connected to any nodes.
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {2, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {8, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 6, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 5, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 10

Therefore, there are a total of [10] 3-stars in your graph.
