Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 5, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {3, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {3} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2, 3, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 16

Therefore, there are a total of [16] 3-stars in your graph.
