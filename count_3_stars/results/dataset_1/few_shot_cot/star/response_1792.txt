Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 5, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - 3-stars: <1, (2, 4, 5)>
  
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 6, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - 3-stars: <2, (1, 3, 6)>, <2, (1, 6, 8)>, <2, (3, 6, 8)>, <2, (1, 3, 8)>
  
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 6, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - 3-stars: <4, (0, 1, 6)>, <4, (0, 1, 7)>, <4, (0, 6, 7)>, <4, (1, 6, 7)>
  
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 6, 8, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - 3-stars: <5, (1, 3, 6)>, <5, (1, 3, 8)>, <5, (1, 6, 8)>, <5, (1, 6, 9)>, <5, (3, 6, 8)>, <5, (3, 6, 9)>, <5, (1, 8, 9)>, <5, (3, 8, 9)>, <5, (6, 8, 9)>, <5, (1, 8, 9)>
  
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - 3-stars: <6, (2, 4, 5)>
  
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - 3-stars: <8, (2, 5, 9)>
  
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Adding up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 8: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 21

Therefore, there are a total of [21] 3-stars in your graph.
