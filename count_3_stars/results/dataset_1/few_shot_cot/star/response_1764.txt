Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 6) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 6
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {6} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {6, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 7, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-star: <5, (0, 7, 8)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <6, (2, 4, 8)>, <6, (4, 6, 9)>, <6, (7, 8, 9)>, <6, (6, 8, 9)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 5, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <7, (1, 5, 9)>, <7, (4, 5, 9)>, <7, (5, 6, 9)>, <7, (7, 8, 9)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 6, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-star: <9, (0, 6, 7)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 10
Therefore, there are a total of [10] 3-stars in your graph.
