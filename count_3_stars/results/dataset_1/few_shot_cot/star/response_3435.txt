Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 8} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 6} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 5, 9} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - <2, (3, 4, 5)> 
    - <2, (3, 4, 9)> 
    - <2, (3, 5, 9)> 
    - <2, (4, 5, 9)> 
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2, 4} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 5, 8} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - <4, (2, 3, 5)> 
    - <4, (2, 3, 8)> 
    - <4, (2, 5, 8)> 
    - <4, (3, 5, 8)> 
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 6, 7} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - <5, (2, 4, 6)> 
    - <5, (2, 4, 7)> 
    - <5, (2, 6, 7)> 
    - <5, (4, 6, 7)> 
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 5, 7, 8} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - <6, (1, 5, 7)> 
    - <6, (1, 5, 8)> 
    - <6, (1, 7, 8)> 
    - <6, (5, 7, 8)> 
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - <7, (5, 6, 8)> 
    - <7, (5, 6, 9)> 
    - <7, (5, 8, 9)> 
    - <7, (6, 8, 9)> 
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 6, 7, 9} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
    - <8, (0, 6, 9)> 
    - <8, (0, 7, 9)> 
    - <8, (4, 6, 7)> 
    - <8, (4, 6, 9)> 
    - <8, (4, 7, 9)> 
    - <8, (6, 7, 9)> 
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {2, 7, 8} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - <9, (2, 7, 8)> 

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Adding up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 31

Therefore, there are a total of [31] 3-stars in your graph.
