Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 6, 7, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - Unique 3-stars:
    - <0, (2, 3, 6)>
    - <0, (2, 3, 7)>
    - <0, (2, 3, 8)>
    - <0, (2, 6, 7)>
    - <0, (2, 6, 8)>
    - <0, (2, 7, 8)>
    - <0, (3, 6, 7)>
    - <0, (3, 6, 8)>
    - <0, (3, 7, 8)>
    - <0, (6, 7, 8)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 1} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {2, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Not connected to any other nodes.
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 6, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 0: 10
Total number of 3-stars = 10
Therefore, there are a total of [10] 3-stars in your graph.
