Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - 3-Star: <0, (2, 5, 9)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 7, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - 3-Star: <1, (2, 7, 8)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 3, 7, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
  - 3-Stars: <2, (0, 1, 3)>, <2, (0, 7, 9)>, <2, (1, 7, 9)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {6, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {4, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 4, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - 3-Stars: <7, (1, 2, 4)>, <7, (1, 2, 9)>, <7, (1, 4, 9)>, <7, (2, 4, 9)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - 3-Star: <9, (0, 2, 7)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 17
Therefore, there are a total of [17] 3-stars in the given graph.
