Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 6, and node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 5, 7, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <<2, (3, 4, 5)>, <2, (3, 4, 7)>, <2, (3, 5, 7)>, <2, (3, 5, 8)>, <2, (4, 5, 7)>, <2, (4, 5, 8)>, <2, (5, 7, 8)>>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2, 6, 7, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <<3, (2, 6, 7)>, <3, (2, 6, 8)>, <3, (2, 7, 8)>, <3, (6, 7, 8)>>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-star: <4, (2, 5, 6)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 4, 7, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <<5, (0, 2, 7)>, <5, (0, 2, 8)>, <5, (0, 4, 7)>, <5, (0, 4, 8)>, <5, (2, 4, 7)>, <5, (2, 4, 8)>, <5, (2, 7, 8)>, <5, (4, 7, 8)>, <5, (7, 8, 2)>, <5, (8, 2, 7)>>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-star: <6, (3, 4, 9)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 5, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <<7, (2, 3, 5)>, <7, (2, 3, 9)>, <7, (2, 5, 9)>, <7, (3, 5, 9)>>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-star: <8, (2, 3, 5)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {6, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 31

Therefore, there are a total of [31] 3-stars in your graph.
