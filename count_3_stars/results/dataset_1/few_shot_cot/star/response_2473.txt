Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - <0, (5, 6, 9)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 7, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - <1, (3, 7, 9)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3}\) = 20
  - <3, (1, 2, 4)>, <3, (1, 2, 6)>, <3, (1, 2, 7)>, <3, (1, 4, 6)>, <3, (1, 4, 7)>, <3, (1, 6, 7)>, <3, (2, 4, 6)>, <3, (2, 4, 7)>, <3, (2, 6, 7)>, <3, (4, 6, 7)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {3, 7, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - <4, (3, 7, 8)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - <6, (0, 3, 9)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3}\) = 20
  - <7, (1, 2, 3)>, <7, (1, 2, 4)>, <7, (1, 2, 5)>, <7, (1, 2, 9)>, <7, (1, 3, 4)>, <7, (1, 3, 5)>, <7, (1, 3, 9)>, <7, (1, 4, 5)>, <7, (1, 4, 9)>, <7, (1, 5, 9)>, <7, (2, 3, 4)>, <7, (2, 3, 5)>, <7, (2, 3, 9)>, <7, (2, 4, 5)>, <7, (2, 4, 9)>, <7, (2, 5, 9)>, <7, (3, 4, 5)>, <7, (3, 4, 9)>, <7, (3, 5, 9)>, <7, (4, 5, 9)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - <8, (3, 4, 9)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 6, 7, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
  - <9, (0, 1, 6)>, <9, (0, 1, 7)>, <9, (0, 1, 8)>, <9, (0, 6, 7)>, <9, (0, 6, 8)>, <9, (0, 7, 8)>, <9, (1, 6, 7)>, <9, (1, 6, 8)>, <9, (1, 7, 8)>, <9, (6, 7, 8)>
  
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 3: 20
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 10
Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 20 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 35

Therefore, there are a total of [35] 3-stars in your graph.
