Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 3) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 5

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list provided, we'll analyze each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 6, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-star: <1, (2, 6, 9)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 5, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <2, (0, 1, 5)>, <2, (0, 1, 8)>, <2, (0, 5, 8)>, <2, (1, 5, 8)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Not connected to any nodes
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-star: <5, (2, 3, 9)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {3} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-star: <9, (0, 1, 5)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 7

Therefore, there are a total of [7] 3-stars in your graph.
