Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {3, 4} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {6, 7, 8} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {6} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: No neighbors
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 8} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = 1
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 6, 7} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {3, 7} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 8

Therefore, there are a total of [8] 3-stars in your graph.
