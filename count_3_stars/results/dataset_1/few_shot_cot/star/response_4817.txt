Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-star configurations: <1, (3, 5, 6)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 7, 8, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - 3-star configurations: <2, (3, 7, 8)>, <2, (3, 7, 9)>, <2, (3, 8, 9)>, <2, (4, 7, 8)>, <2, (4, 7, 9)>, <2, (4, 8, 9)>, <2, (7, 8, 9)>, <2, (3, 4, 7)>, <2, (3, 4, 8)>, <2, (3, 4, 9)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 9} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
  - 3-star configurations: <3, (1, 5, 6)>, <3, (2, 4, 7)>, <3, (2, 4, 9)>, <3, (2, 7, 8)>, <3, (2, 8, 9)>, <3, (4, 5, 7)>, <3, (4, 5, 9)>, <3, (4, 7, 8)>, <3, (4, 8, 9)>, <3, (5, 7, 8)>, and more.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 3, 6, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - 3-star configurations: <4, (0, 2, 7)>, <4, (0, 2, 9)>, <4, (0, 7, 8)>, <4, (0, 8, 9)>, <4, (2, 3, 7)>, <4, (2, 3, 9)>, <4, (2, 7, 8)>, <4, (2, 8, 9)>, <4, (3, 6, 7)>, <4, (3, 6, 9)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 3, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-star configurations: <6, (1, 3, 4)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-star configurations: <7, (2, 4, 8)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 7, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-star configurations: <9, (2, 3, 8)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 3: 20
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 44

Therefore, there are a total of [44] 3-stars in your graph.
