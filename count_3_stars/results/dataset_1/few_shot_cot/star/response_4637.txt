Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, 7, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Unique 3-stars: <1, (2, 8, 9)>, <1, (3, 8, 9)>, <1, (2, 3, 9)>, <1, (2, 3, 8)>

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 1} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 7, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Unique 3-star: <3, (1, 7, 9)>

- **Node 4**: Not connected to any other nodes.
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
  
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {8, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 6**: Not connected to any other nodes.
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
  
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Unique 3-star: <7, (0, 3, 9)>
  
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 5, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Unique 3-star: <8, (1, 5, 9)>
  
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 5, 7, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - Unique 3-stars: <9, (1, 5, 8)>, <9, (1, 7, 8)>, <9, (1, 3, 5)>, <9, (1, 3, 7)>, <9, (1, 3, 8)>, <9, (3, 5, 7)>, <9, (3, 5, 8)>, <9, (3, 7, 8)>, <9, (5, 7, 8)>, <9, (1, 3, 5)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 17

Therefore, there are a total of [17] 3-stars in your graph.
