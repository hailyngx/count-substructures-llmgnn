Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 6) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list provided, we'll analyze each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {6} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 6, 9} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - Unique 3-star configurations:
        - <3, (2, 4, 6)>
        - <3, (2, 4, 9)>
        - <3, (2, 6, 9)>
        - <3, (4, 6, 9)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 9} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - Unique 3-star configuration:
        - <4, (0, 3, 9)>
- **Node 5**: Not connected to any other nodes
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 3} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {7, 9} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 8} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - Unique 3-star configuration:
        - <9, (3, 4, 8)>
    
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6

Therefore, there are a total of [6] 3-stars in your graph.
