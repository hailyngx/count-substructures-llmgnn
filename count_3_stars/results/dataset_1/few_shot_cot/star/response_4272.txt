Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 9) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 4, 6, and node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: No neighbors. Cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 8} (2 neighbors). Cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 8} (2 neighbors). Cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {9} (1 neighbor). Cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 8, 9} (3 neighbors).
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Unique 3-star: <4, (5, 8, 9)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 4} (3 neighbors).
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Unique 3-star: <5, (1, 2, 4)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9} (1 neighbor). Cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {8, 9} (2 neighbors). Cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 4, 7} (4 neighbors).
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Unique 3-stars: <8, (1, 2, 4)>, <8, (1, 4, 7)>, <8, (2, 4, 7)>, <8, (1, 2, 7)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 6, 7} (4 neighbors).
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Unique 3-stars: <9, (3, 4, 6)>, <9, (3, 4, 7)>, <9, (4, 6, 7)>, <9, (3, 6, 7)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 10

Therefore, there are a total of [10] 3-stars in your graph.
