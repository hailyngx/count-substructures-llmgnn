Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - 3-Stars: <0, (4, 5, 9)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 5, 7, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
  - 3-Stars: <2, (1, 4, 5)>, <2, (1, 5, 7)>, <2, (1, 4, 7)>, <2, (4, 5, 7)>, <2, (1, 4, 9)>, <2, (1, 5, 9)>, <2, (1, 7, 9)>, <2, (4, 5, 9)>, <2, (4, 7, 9)>, <2, (5, 7, 9)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 7, 8, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
  - 3-Stars: <3, (4, 5, 7)>, <3, (4, 5, 9)>, <3, (4, 7, 9)>, <3, (5, 7, 9)>, <3, (4, 7, 8)>, <3, (5, 7, 8)>, <3, (4, 5, 8)>, <3, (4, 8, 9)>, <3, (5, 8, 9)>, <3, (7, 8, 9)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 3, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - 3-Stars: <4, (0, 2, 3)>, <4, (0, 2, 8)>, <4, (0, 3, 8)>, <4, (2, 3, 8)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 3, 6, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
  - 3-Stars: <5, (0, 2, 3)>, <5, (0, 3, 6)>, <5, (0, 3, 7)>, <5, (2, 3, 6)>, <5, (2, 3, 7)>, <5, (2, 6, 7)>, <5, (0, 2, 6)>, <5, (0, 2, 7)>, <5, (0, 6, 7)>, <5, (2, 6, 7)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 5, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - 3-Stars: <7, (2, 3, 5)>, <7, (2, 3, 9)>, <7, (2, 5, 9)>, <7, (3, 5, 9)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {3, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 3, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - 3-Stars: <9, (0, 2, 3)>, <9, (0, 3, 7)>, <9, (2, 3, 7)>, <9, (0, 2, 7)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 43

Therefore, there are a total of [43] 3-stars in the provided graph.
