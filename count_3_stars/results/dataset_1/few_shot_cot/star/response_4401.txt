Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 2} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 5, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {4, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {7, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars  
Add up all the valid configurations:  
- From Node 0: 1  
- From Node 4: 4  
- From Node 7: 1  
- From Node 9: 1  

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 7  
Therefore, there are a total of [7] 3-stars in your graph.  
  
The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (3, 4, 8)>, <4, (0, 5, 9)>, <7, (5, 6, 9)>
