Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 7) (6, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 3

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node  
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:  
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {3} (1 neighbor)  
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.  

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3} (1 neighbor)  
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.  

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4, 6} (2 neighbors)  
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.  

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 7, 9} (4 neighbors)  
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.  

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)  
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.  

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor)  
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.  

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)  
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.  

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {3, 5} (2 neighbors)  
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.  

- **Node 8**: No neighbors  
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.  

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {3} (1 neighbor)  
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.  

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars  
Add up all the valid configurations:  
- None of the nodes can form a 3-star based on the given adjacency list.  

Total number of 3-stars = 0  
Therefore, there are a total of [0] 3-stars in your graph.
