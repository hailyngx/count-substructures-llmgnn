Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 10 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 7) (2, 8) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: No neighbors, cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 1**: No neighbors, cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {7, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: No neighbors, cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {4, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: No neighbors, cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <7, (2, 5, 9)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
- From Node 7: 1

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1].
