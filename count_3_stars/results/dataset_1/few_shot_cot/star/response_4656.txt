Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 3

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 8} (3 neighbors)
   - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
   - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {6, 7, 8} (3 neighbors)
   - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
   - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 5} (3 neighbors)
   - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {3, 4} (2 neighbors)
   - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
   - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 2} (2 neighbors)
   - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2, 3} (4 neighbors)
   - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {3} (1 neighbor)
   - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 8: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 11

Therefore, there are a total of [11] 3-stars in your graph.
