Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 4, 5, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - Possible 3-stars: <0, (2, 3, 4)>, <0, (2, 3, 5)>, <0, (2, 3, 7)>, <0, (2, 4, 5)>, <0, (2, 4, 7)>, <0, (2, 5, 7)>, <0, (3, 4, 5)>, <0, (3, 4, 7)>, <0, (3, 5, 7)>, <0, (4, 5, 7)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 5, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Possible 3-stars: <2, (0, 5, 8)>, <2, (0, 5, 9)>, <2, (8, 6, 7)>, <2, (6, 7, 9)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Possible 3-star: <3, (0, 4, 5)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 5, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Possible 3-stars: <4, (0, 3, 5)>, <4, (0, 5, 9)>, <4, (3, 5, 9)>, <4, (0, 3, 9)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
  - Possible 3-stars: <5, (0, 1, 2)>, <5, (0, 1, 3)>, <5, (0, 1, 4)>, <5, (0, 1, 6)>, <5, (0, 2, 3)>, <5, (0, 2, 4)>, <5, (0, 2, 6)>, <5, (0, 3, 4)>, <5, (0, 3, 6)>, <5, (0, 4, 6)>, <5, (1, 2, 3)>, <5, (1, 2, 4)>, <5, (1, 2, 6)>, <5, (1, 3, 4)>, <5, (1, 3, 6)>, <5, (1, 4, 6)>, <5, (2, 3, 4)>, <5, (2, 3, 6)>, <5, (2, 4, 6)>, <5, (3, 4, 6)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Possible 3-star: <6, (5, 7, 8)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 6, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Possible 3-star: <7, (0, 6, 9)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Possible 3-star: <9, (2, 4, 7)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 20
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 20 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 42

Therefore, there are a total of [42] 3-stars in your graph.
