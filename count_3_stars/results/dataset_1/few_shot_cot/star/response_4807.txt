Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 6

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 6, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Possible 3-stars: <0, (2, 6, 8)>, <0, (2, 6, 9)>, <0, (2, 8, 9)>, <0, (6, 8, 9)>
  
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 5, 6, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - Possible 3-stars: <1, (2, 3, 5)>, <1, (2, 3, 6)>, <1, (2, 3, 7)>, <1, (2, 5, 6)>, <1, (2, 5, 7)>, <1, (2, 6, 7)>, <1, (3, 5, 6)>, <1, (3, 5, 7)>, <1, (3, 6, 7)>, <1, (5, 6, 7)>
  
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Possible 3-star: <2, (0, 1, 7)>
  
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 4**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
  
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 5, 8, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - Possible 3-stars: <6, (0, 1, 5)>, <6, (0, 1, 8)>, <6, (0, 1, 9)>, <6, (0, 5, 8)>, <6, (0, 5, 9)>, <6, (0, 8, 9)>, <6, (1, 5, 8)>, <6, (1, 5, 9)>, <6, (1, 8, 9)>, <6, (5, 8, 9)>
  
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Possible 3-star: <7, (1, 2, 3)>
  
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 0: 4 configurations
- From Node 1: 10 configurations
- From Node 2: 1 configuration
- From Node 6: 10 configurations
- From Node 7: 1 configuration

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 26

Therefore, there are a total of [26] 3-stars in your graph based on the provided adjacency list.
