Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 5

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list provided, we'll evaluate each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 6, 8} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 3, 4} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 4} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 4} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3, 5, 9} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {4, 9} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: No neighbors
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {4, 5} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Adding up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 17

Therefore, there are a total of [17] 3-stars in the graph provided.
