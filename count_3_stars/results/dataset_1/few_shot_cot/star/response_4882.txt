Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 1

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:

- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - Unique 3-stars: <1, (4, 7, 9)>, <1, (4, 7, 8)>, <1, (7, 8, 9)>, <1, (4, 8, 9)>

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 1} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 3, 5} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - Unique 3-stars: <7, (0, 1, 3)>, <7, (0, 1, 5)>, <7, (1, 3, 5)>, <7, (0, 3, 5)>

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 1} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 0
- From Node 3: 0
- From Node 4: 0
- From Node 5: 0
- From Node 6: 0
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 0

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 4 + 1 + 0 = 10

Therefore, there are a total of [10] 3-stars in your graph.
