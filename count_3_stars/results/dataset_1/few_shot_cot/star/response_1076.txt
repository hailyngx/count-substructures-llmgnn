Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
    - **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9} (7 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{7}{3} = 35\)
    - **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 8} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 5, 6, 8} (5 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
    - **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2, 8} (4 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 9} (2 neighbors)
        - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
    - **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2, 7} (2 neighbors)
        - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
    - **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 2} (2 neighbors)
        - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
    - **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
        - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
    - **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2, 3, 9} (5 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
    - **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 8} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
        
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
    Add up all the valid configurations:
    - From Node 0: 35
    - From Node 1: 1
    - From Node 2: 10
    - From Node 3: 4
    - From Node 8: 10
    - From Node 9: 1
    
Total number of 3-stars = 35 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 61

Therefore, there are a total of [61] 3-stars in your graph.
