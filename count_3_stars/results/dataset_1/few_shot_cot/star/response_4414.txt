Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 2

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {9} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {6, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {8, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {3, 6, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 5, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-stars: 
    - <6, (1, 3, 5)>
    - <6, (1, 5, 8)>
    - <6, (3, 5, 8)>
    - <6, (1, 3, 8)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
  - Unique 3-stars: 
    - <8, (2, 3, 4)>
    - <8, (2, 3, 5)>
    - <8, (2, 3, 6)>
    - <8, (2, 3, 7)>
    - <8, (2, 4, 5)>
    - <8, (2, 4, 6)>
    - <8, (2, 4, 7)>
    - <8, (2, 5, 6)>
    - <8, (2, 5, 7)>
    - <8, (2, 6, 7)>
    - <8, (3, 4, 5)>
    - <8, (3, 4, 6)>
    - <8, (3, 4, 7)>
    - <8, (3, 5, 6)>
    - <8, (3, 5, 7)>
    - <8, (3, 6, 7)>
    - <8, (4, 5, 6)>
    - <8, (4, 5, 7)>
    - <8, (4, 6, 7)>
    - <8, (5, 6, 7)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 2} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 20

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 20 = 27

Therefore, there are a total of [27] 3-stars in your graph.
