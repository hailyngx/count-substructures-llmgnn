Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <7, (2, 3, 5)>

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 3, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 57

Therefore, there are a total of [57] 3-stars in your graph.
