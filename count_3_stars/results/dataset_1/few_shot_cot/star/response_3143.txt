Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 6, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 5} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 4, 6} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 4} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 5} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3, 5, 6} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 4} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 9} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {7, 9} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {6, 8} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 18

Therefore, there are a total of [18] 3-stars in your graph.
