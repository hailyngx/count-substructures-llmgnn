Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 2) (6, 4) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - <1, (2, 4, 8)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9} (7 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \)
  - <2, (0, 3, 9)>, <2, (0, 4, 5)>, <2, (0, 4, 7)>, <2, (0, 5, 7)>, <2, (3, 4, 9)>, <2, (3, 9, 7)>, <2, (4, 5, 7)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - <3, (0, 2, 9)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - <4, (1, 2, 6)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - <9, (2, 3, 8)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 35
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 9: 1
Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 35 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 39

Therefore, there are a total of [39] 3-stars in your graph.
