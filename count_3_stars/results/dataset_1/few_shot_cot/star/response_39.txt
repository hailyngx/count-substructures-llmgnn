Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {3, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 5, 6, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - 3-Stars: <1, (2, 4, 5)>, <1, (2, 4, 6)>, <1, (2, 4, 8)>, <1, (2, 5, 6)>, <1, (2, 5, 8)>, <1, (4, 5, 6)>, <1, (4, 5, 8)>, <1, (5, 6, 8)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 5, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 6, 7, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-Stars: <3, (0, 6, 7)>, <3, (0, 6, 8)>, <3, (7, 8, 9)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 4, 6, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - 3-Stars: <5, (1, 2, 6)>, <5, (1, 2, 8)>, <5, (1, 6, 8)>, <5, (2, 6, 8)>, <5, (4, 6, 8)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 5, 8, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - 3-Stars: <6, (1, 3, 8)>, <6, (1, 5, 8)>, <6, (1, 8, 9)>, <6, (3, 8, 9)>, <6, (5, 8, 9)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {3, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 6, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-Stars: <8, (3, 6, 9)>, <8, (5, 6, 9)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2, 6, 7, 8} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
  - 3-Stars: <9, (0, 1, 6)>, <9, (0, 1, 8)>, <9, (0, 6, 8)>, <9, (1, 6, 8)>, <9, (2, 6, 8)>
- Node 0, 4, and 7 cannot form any 3-stars as they have less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 20
Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 20 = 59

Therefore, there are a total of [59] 3-stars in your graph.
