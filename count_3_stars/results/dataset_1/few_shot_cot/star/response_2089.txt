Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 7

Node 3 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 6} (2 neighbors)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 5, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  3-stars: <2, (0, 5, 8)>, <2, (0, 5, 9)>, <2, (0, 8, 9)>, <2, (5, 8, 9)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 9} (3 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  3-stars: <3, (4, 5, 9)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {3, 6, 7, 9} (4 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  3-stars: <4, (3, 6, 7)>, <4, (3, 6, 9)>, <4, (3, 7, 9)>, <4, (6, 7, 9)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 9} (3 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  3-stars: <5, (2, 3, 9)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 4} (2 neighbors)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 9} (3 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  3-stars: <7, (1, 4, 9)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2, 9} (2 neighbors)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8} (6 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
  3-stars: <9, (2, 3, 4)>, <9, (2, 3, 5)>, <9, (2, 3, 7)>, <9, (2, 3, 8)>, <9, (2, 4, 5)>, <9, (2, 4, 7)>, <9, (2, 4, 8)>, <9, (2, 5, 7)>, <9, (2, 5, 8)>, <9, (2, 7, 8)>, <9, (3, 4, 5)>, <9, (3, 4, 7)>, <9, (3, 4, 8)>, <9, (3, 5, 7)>, <9, (3, 5, 8)>, <9, (3, 7, 8)>, <9, (4, 5, 7)>, <9, (4, 5, 8)>, <9, (4, 7, 8)>, <9, (5, 7, 8)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 9: 20

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 20 = 31

Therefore, there are a total of [31] 3-stars in your graph.
