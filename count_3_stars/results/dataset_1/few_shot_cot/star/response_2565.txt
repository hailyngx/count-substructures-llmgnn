Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Unique 3-star: <2, (4, 5, 7)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Unique 3-star: <3, (4, 8, 9)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Unique 3-stars: <4, (1, 2, 7)>, <4, (1, 3, 7)>, <4, (2, 3, 7)>, <4, (2, 5, 7)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 2} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {7, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
  - Unique 3-stars: <7, (0, 4, 9)>, <7, (0, 6, 8)>, <7, (2, 4, 9)>, <7, (2, 6, 8)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {3, 6, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Unique 3-star: <8, (3, 6, 7)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {3, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Adding up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 7: 20
- From Node 8: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 20 + 1 = 27

Therefore, there are a total of [27] 3-stars in your graph.
