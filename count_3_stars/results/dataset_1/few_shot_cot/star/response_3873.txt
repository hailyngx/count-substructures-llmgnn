Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: No neighbors, cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 6, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-Stars: <1, (2, 4, 6)>, <1, (2, 4, 9)>, <1, (2, 6, 9)>, <1, (4, 6, 9)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 5, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-Stars: <2, (1, 5, 9)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2, 6, 7, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-Stars: <5, (2, 6, 7)>, <5, (2, 6, 9)>, <5, (2, 7, 9)>, <5, (6, 7, 9)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {3, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: No neighbors, cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-Stars: <9, (1, 2, 5)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 10

Therefore, there are a total of [10] 3-stars in your graph.
