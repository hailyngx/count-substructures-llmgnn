Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {7, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-Star: <2, (0, 4, 9)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-Stars: 
    - <3, (4, 7, 8)>
    - <3, (4, 7, 9)>
    - <3, (4, 8, 9)>
    - <3, (7, 8, 9)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 3, 5, 6} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - 3-Stars: 
    - <4, (0, 2, 6)>
    - <4, (0, 2, 5)>
    - <4, (0, 6, 5)>
    - <4, (2, 6, 5)>
    - <4, (3, 6, 5)>
    - <4, (3, 2, 6)>
    - <4, (3, 2, 5)>
    - <4, (3, 6, 2)>
    - <4, (3, 6, 5)>
    - <4, (5, 6, 2)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-Stars: 
    - <5, (4, 7, 8)>
    - <5, (4, 7, 9)>
    - <5, (4, 8, 9)>
    - <5, (7, 8, 9)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-Stars: 
    - <6, (4, 7, 8)>
    - <6, (4, 7, 9)>
    - <6, (4, 8, 9)>
    - <6, (7, 8, 9)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 5, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-Stars: 
    - <7, (1, 3, 6)>
    - <7, (1, 5, 6)>
    - <7, (1, 3, 5)>
    - <7, (3, 5, 6)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 5, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-Stars: 
    - <8, (1, 3, 6)>
    - <8, (1, 5, 6)>
    - <8, (1, 3, 5)>
    - <8, (3, 5, 6)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 5, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-Stars: 
    - <9, (2, 3, 6)>
    - <9, (2, 5, 6)>
    - <9, (2, 3, 5)>
    - <9, (3, 5, 6)>
  
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 35

Therefore, there are a total of [35] 3-stars in your graph.
