Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: No neighbors, cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor), cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 6, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <2, (3, 5, 6)>, <2, (3, 5, 9)>, <2, (3, 6, 9)>, <2, (5, 6, 9)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 5, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <3, (2, 4, 5)>, <3, (2, 4, 8)>, <3, (2, 5, 8)>, <3, (4, 5, 8)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {3, 6, 7, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <4, (3, 6, 7)>, <4, (3, 6, 8)>, <4, (3, 7, 8)>, <4, (6, 7, 8)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 7, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <5, (2, 3, 7)>, <5, (2, 3, 8)>, <5, (2, 7, 8)>, <5, (3, 7, 8)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {2, 4} (2 neighbors), cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 8} (3 neighbors), cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 4, 5, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <8, (1, 3, 4)>, <8, (1, 3, 5)>, <8, (1, 3, 7)>, <8, (1, 4, 5)>, <8, (1, 4, 7)>, <8, (1, 5, 7)>, <8, (3, 4, 5)>, <8, (3, 4, 7)>, <8, (3, 5, 7)>, <8, (4, 5, 7)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor), cannot form a 3-star.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Adding up the valid configurations:
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 8: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 26

Therefore, there are a total of [26] 3-stars in your graph.
