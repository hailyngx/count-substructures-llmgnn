Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6)

Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and node 6

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 6, 8, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <1, (0, 4, 6)>, <1, (0, 4, 8)>, <1, (0, 6, 8)>, <1, (4, 6, 8)>, <1, (4, 6, 9)>, <1, (4, 8, 9)>, <1, (6, 8, 9)>, <1, (0, 6, 9)>, <1, (0, 8, 9)>, <1, (6, 8, 9)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {9} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <3, (4, 6, 8)>, <3, (4, 6, 9)>, <3, (4, 8, 9)>, <3, (6, 8, 9)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <4, (1, 3, 9)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {8, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <6, (1, 3, 8)>, <6, (1, 3, 9)>, <6, (1, 8, 9)>, <6, (3, 8, 9)>
- **Node 7**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 3, 5, 6} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <8, (0, 1, 3)>, <8, (0, 1, 6)>, <8, (0, 3, 6)>, <8, (1, 3, 6)>, <8, (1, 3, 9)>, <8, (1, 6, 9)>, <8, (3, 6, 9)>, <8, (0, 3, 9)>, <8, (0, 6, 9)>, <8, (3, 6, 9)>
- **Node 9**: Node 9: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <9, (1, 3, 4)>, <9, (1, 3, 5)>, <9, (1, 3, 6)>, <9, (1, 4, 5)>, <9, (1, 4, 6)>, <9, (1, 5, 6)>, <9, (3, 4, 5)>, <9, (3, 4, 6)>, <9, (3, 5, 6)>, <9, (4, 5, 6)>, <9, (1, 4, 8)>, <9, (1, 5, 8)>, <9, (1, 6, 8)>, <9, (1, 4, 9)>, <9, (1, 5, 9)>, <9, (1, 6, 9)>, <9, (4, 5, 8)>, <9, (4, 6, 8)>, <9, (4, 5, 9)>, <9, (5, 6, 8)>
  
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 20

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 20 = 49

Therefore, there are a total of [49] 3-stars in your graph.
