Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 6

Response:
Given the adjacency list provided, we'll analyze each node to calculate the number of 3-stars formed. 

- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {7, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-star: <1, (7, 8, 9)>

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-star: <2, (3, 4, 7)>

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 6, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-stars: 
    - <3, (2, 6, 9)>
    - <3, (2, 5, 9)>
    - <3, (5, 4, 9)>
    - <3, (6, 4, 9)>

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 5, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-stars:
    - <4, (0, 2, 5)>
    - <4, (0, 9, 2)>
    - <4, (0, 5, 9)>
    - <4, (2, 5, 9)>

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {3, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {3, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-star: <6, (3, 8, 9)>

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-star: <7, (0, 1, 2)>

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 4, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-stars:
    - <9, (1, 3, 6)>
    - <9, (1, 3, 4)>
    - <9, (1, 6, 4)>
    - <9, (3, 4, 6)>

Summing up the total number of 3-stars:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 16

Therefore, there are a total of [16] 3-stars in your graph.
