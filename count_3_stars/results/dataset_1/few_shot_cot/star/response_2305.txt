Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 9) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 
  - 3-Star: <0, (1, 3, 6)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 
  - 3-Star: <1, (0, 4, 5)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 6, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 
  - 3-Stars: <3, (0, 4, 6)>, <3, (0, 4, 9)>, <3, (0, 6, 9)>, <3, (4, 6, 9)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 5, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 
  - 3-Stars: <4, (1, 3, 5)>, <4, (1, 3, 6)>, <4, (1, 5, 6)>, <4, (3, 5, 6)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 
  - 3-Star: <6, (0, 3, 4)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {3, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 6: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 11
Therefore, there are a total of [11] 3-stars in your graph.
