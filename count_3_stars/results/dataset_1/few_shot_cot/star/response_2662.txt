Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 6, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-Stars: <1, (0, 3, 6)>, <1, (0, 3, 9)>, <1, (0, 6, 9)>, <1, (3, 6, 9)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 5, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-Stars: <2, (0, 3, 5)>, <2, (0, 3, 7)>, <2, (0, 5, 7)>, <2, (3, 5, 7)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 4**: Not connected to any other nodes
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2, 6, 7, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-Stars: <5, (2, 6, 7)>, <5, (2, 6, 8)>, <5, (2, 7, 8)>, <5, (6, 7, 8)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 5, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-Stars: <7, (0, 2, 5)>, <7, (0, 2, 9)>, <7, (0, 5, 9)>, <7, (2, 5, 9)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 7, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 20
Therefore, there are a total of [20] 3-stars in your graph.
