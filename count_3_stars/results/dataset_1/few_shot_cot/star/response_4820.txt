Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 3) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 6

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 6, 7, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <3, (1, 6, 7)>, <3, (1, 6, 8)>, <3, (6, 7, 8)>, <3, (1, 7, 8)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3, 4, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - <6, (1, 2, 3)>, <6, (1, 2, 4)>, <6, (1, 2, 9)>, <6, (1, 3, 4)>, <6, (1, 3, 9)>, <6, (1, 4, 9)>, <6, (2, 3, 4)>, <6, (2, 3, 9)>, <6, (2, 4, 9)>, <6, (3, 4, 9)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {3} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {3} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 6: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 = 14

Therefore, there are a total of [14] 3-stars in the graph provided.
