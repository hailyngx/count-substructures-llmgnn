Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 5

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 7, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 5, 7, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {3} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 4, 5} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {3, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 20
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 1 = 33

Therefore, there are a total of [33] 3-stars in your graph.
