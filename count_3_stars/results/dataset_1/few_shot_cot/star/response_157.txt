Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 6, 8, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
  - Unique 3-stars: <0, (1, 4, 8)>, <0, (1, 4, 9)>, <0, (1, 6, 8)>, <0, (1, 6, 9)>, <0, (4, 6, 8)>, <0, (4, 6, 9)>, <0, (4, 8, 9)>, <0, (6, 8, 9)>, <0, (1, 4, 6)>, <0, (1, 8, 9)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 4, 7, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
  - Unique 3-stars: <1, (0, 4, 8)>, <1, (0, 4, 9)>, <1, (0, 6, 8)>, <1, (0, 6, 9)>, <1, (3, 4, 7)>, <1, (3, 4, 8)>, <1, (3, 4, 9)>, <1, (3, 7, 8)>, <1, (7, 8, 9)>, <1, (0, 7, 8)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - Unique 3-stars: <2, (4, 6, 7)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - Unique 3-stars: <3, (1, 4, 5)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2, 3, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
  - Unique 3-stars: <4, (0, 1, 7)>, <4, (0, 2, 7)>, <4, (0, 3, 7)>, <4, (1, 2, 7)>, <4, (1, 3, 7)>, <4, (2, 3, 7)>, <4, (0, 1, 2)>, <4, (0, 1, 3)>, <4, (0, 2, 3)>, <4, (1, 2, 3)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {3} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - Unique 3-stars: <6, (0, 2, 8)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - Unique 3-stars: <7, (1, 2, 4)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - Unique 3-stars: <8, (0, 1, 6)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 35

Therefore, there are a total of [35] 3-stars in your graph.
