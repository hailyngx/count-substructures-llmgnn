Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 4, 9} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - Unique 3-stars: <0, (2, 3, 4)>, <0, (2, 3, 9)>, <0, (2, 4, 9)>, <0, (3, 4, 9)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 6} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has fewer than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 6, 7, 8, 9} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    - Unique 3-stars: <2, (0, 6, 7)>, <2, (0, 6, 8)>, <2, (0, 6, 9)>, <2, (0, 7, 8)>, <2, (0, 7, 9)>, <2, (0, 8, 9)>, <2, (6, 7, 8)>, <2, (6, 7, 9)>, <2, (6, 8, 9)>, <2, (7, 8, 9)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 7} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
    - Unique 3-stars: <3, (0, 4, 7)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 3} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
    - Unique 3-stars: <4, (0, 1, 3)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has fewer than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 2} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has fewer than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2, 3} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has fewer than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 9} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
    - Unique 3-stars: <8, (2, 5, 9)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 8} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
    - Unique 3-stars: <9, (0, 2, 8)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 18

Therefore, there are a total of [18] 3-stars in your graph.
