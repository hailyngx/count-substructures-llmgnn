Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, and node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 7, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-star: <1, (2, 7, 8)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 4, 5, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <2, (0, 1, 4)>, <2, (0, 1, 5)>, <2, (0, 4, 5)>, <2, (1, 4, 5)>, <2, (4, 5, 9)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {6, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 2} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {3, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 6, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <9, (2, 3, 6)>, <9, (2, 3, 7)>, <9, (2, 6, 7)>, <9, (3, 6, 7)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 1: 1 (1 unique 3-star)
- From Node 2: 10 (5 unique 3-stars)
- From Node 9: 4 (4 unique 3-stars)

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 4 = 15

Therefore, there are a total of [15] 3-stars in your graph.
