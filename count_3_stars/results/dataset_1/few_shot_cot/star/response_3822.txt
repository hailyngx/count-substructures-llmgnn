Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <1, (3, 5, 8)>, <1, (3, 5, 9)>, <1, (3, 8, 9)>, <1, (5, 8, 9)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3, 7, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-star: <2, (3, 7, 9)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 5, 7, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <3, (1, 5, 8)>, <3, (1, 5, 9)>, <3, (1, 8, 9)>, <3, (2, 5, 7)>, <3, (2, 7, 9)>, <3, (5, 7, 8)>, <3, (5, 7, 9)>, <3, (5, 8, 9)>, <3, (7, 8, 9)>, <3, (1, 8, 9)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 5, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-star: <4, (0, 5, 7)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 4, 7, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <5, (1, 3, 8)>, <5, (1, 3, 9)>, <5, (1, 8, 9)>, <5, (3, 4, 7)>, <5, (3, 7, 8)>, <5, (3, 7, 9)>, <5, (3, 8, 9)>, <5, (4, 7, 8)>, <5, (4, 7, 9)>, <5, (7, 8, 9)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 7, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-star: <6, (0, 7, 9)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 4, 5, 6} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <7, (2, 3, 7)>, <7, (2, 3, 9)>, <7, (2, 7, 9)>, <7, (3, 4, 7)>, <7, (3, 5, 7)>, <7, (3, 6, 7)>, <7, (3, 7, 8)>, <7, (3, 7, 9)>, <7, (4, 5, 7)>, <7, (5, 6, 7)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 5, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <8, (1, 5, 9)>, <8, (3, 5, 9)>, <8, (1, 3, 5)>, <8, (3, 5, 9)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 6, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <9, (1, 6, 8)>, <9, (1, 6, 9)>, <9, (1, 8, 9)>, <9, (6, 8, 9)>
  
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 4
Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 45

Therefore, there are a total of [45] 3-stars in your graph.
