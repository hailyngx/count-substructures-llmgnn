Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - <1, (5, 6, 9)>
  
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 3**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
  
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - <4, (0, 2, 6)>
  
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 6, 7, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - <5, (1, 6, 7)>, <5, (1, 6, 9)>, <5, (6, 7, 9)>, <5, (1, 7, 9)>
  
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - <6, (1, 4, 5)>
  
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 5, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - <9, (1, 5, 7)>
  
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 8

Therefore, there are a total of [8] 3-stars in your graph.
