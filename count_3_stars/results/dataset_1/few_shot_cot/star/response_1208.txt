Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, and node 8

Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 4

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
        
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 6, 8} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - <0, (1, 4, 6)>, <0, (1, 4, 8)>, <0, (1, 6, 8)>, <0, (4, 6, 8)>
      
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 8} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - <1, (0, 3, 8)>
    
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 6} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - <2, (3, 5, 6)>
    
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 9} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - <3, (1, 2, 9)>
    
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 7, 9} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - <4, (0, 7, 9)>
    
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2, 6} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
    
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 5, 7, 8} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
    - <6, (0, 2, 5)>, <6, (0, 2, 7)>, <6, (0, 2, 8)>, <6, (0, 5, 7)>, <6, (0, 5, 8)>, <6, (0, 7, 8)>, <6, (2, 5, 7)>, <6, (2, 5, 8)>, <6, (2, 7, 8)>, <6, (5, 7, 8)>
    
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 6} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
    
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 6} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - <8, (0, 1, 6)>
    
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {3, 4} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
    
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:  
- From Node 0: 4  
- From Node 1: 1  
- From Node 2: 1  
- From Node 3: 1  
- From Node 4: 1  
- From Node 6: 10  
- From Node 8: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 19

Therefore, there are a total of [19] 3-stars in your graph.
