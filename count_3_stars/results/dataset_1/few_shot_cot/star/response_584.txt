Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 5
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 7, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 5} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 1**: Not connected to any nodes, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {6} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 6} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 8} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {2, 3} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {9} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5, 9} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {7, 8} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1

Therefore, there is a total of [1] 3-star in your graph.
