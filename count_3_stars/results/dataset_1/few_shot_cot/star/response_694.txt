Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 3, 4, 5} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
    - Possible 3-star configurations: <1, (0, 3, 4)>, <1, (0, 3, 5)>, <1, (0, 4, 5)>, <1, (3, 4, 5)>, <1, (0, 3, 2)>, <1, (2, 5, 4)>, <1, (2, 5, 6)>, <1, (4, 9, 5)>, <1, (4, 3, 5)>, <1, (3, 5, 6)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 5, 6, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - Possible 3-star configurations: <2, (1, 5, 6)>, <2, (1, 6, 7)>, <2, (5, 7, 6)>, <2, (6, 3, 5)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 4, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - Possible 3-star configurations: <3, (0, 1, 4)>, <3, (0, 1, 6)>, <3, (4, 1, 6)>, <3, (0, 6, 1)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 5, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - Possible 3-star configurations: <4, (1, 3, 5)>, <4, (1, 3, 9)>, <4, (1, 5, 9)>, <4, (3, 5, 9)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
    - Possible 3-star configurations: <5, (1, 2, 4)>, <5, (1, 2, 6)>, <5, (1, 2, 9)>, <5, (1, 4, 9)>, <5, (1, 6, 9)>, <5, (2, 6, 9)>, <5, (1, 4, 6)>, <5, (1, 4, 5)>, <5, (1, 4, 3)>, <5, (1, 6, 4)>, <5, (2, 6, 5)>, <5, (2, 6, 3)>, <5, (4, 3, 6)>, <5, (4, 3, 9)>, <5, (3, 6, 9)>, <5, (3, 6, 2)>, <5, (3, 6, 7)>, <5, (3, 7, 2)>, <5, (3, 7, 6)>, <5, (6, 7, 2)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 5, 7, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
    - Possible 3-star configurations: <6, (2, 3, 5)>, <6, (2, 5, 7)>, <6, (2, 5, 9)>, <6, (2, 7, 9)>, <6, (3, 5, 9)>, <6, (3, 5, 1)>, <6, (5, 1, 9)>, <6, (5, 1, 4)>, <6, (5, 4, 9)>, <6, (5, 4, 3)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - Possible 3-star configurations: <9, (4, 5, 6)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 20
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 1 = 53

Therefore, there are a total of [53] 3-stars in your graph.
