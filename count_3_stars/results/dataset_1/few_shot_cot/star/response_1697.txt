Node 4 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 7, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {9} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 4, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - Unique 3-stars: <2, (0, 3, 8)>, <2, (0, 4, 8)>, <2, (3, 4, 8)>, <2, (3, 8, 9)>

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 7, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - Unique 3-stars: <3, (0, 2, 8)>, <3, (0, 7, 8)>, <3, (2, 7, 8)>, <3, (2, 8, 9)>

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {4, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {3, 6, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - Unique 3-stars: <7, (3, 6, 8)>, <7, (3, 8, 9)>, <7, (6, 8, 9)>

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3}\) = 20
  - Unique 3-stars: <8, (2, 4, 7)>, <8, (2, 4, 9)>, <8, (2, 5, 7)>, <8, (2, 5, 9)>, <8, (2, 7, 9)>, <8, (4, 5, 7)>, <8, (4, 5, 9)>, <8, (4, 7, 9)>, <8, (5, 7, 9)>

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 7, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - Unique 3-stars: <9, (0, 1, 8)>, <9, (0, 7, 8)>, <9, (1, 7, 8)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 20
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 20 + 4 = 38

Therefore, there are a total of [38] 3-stars in your graph.
