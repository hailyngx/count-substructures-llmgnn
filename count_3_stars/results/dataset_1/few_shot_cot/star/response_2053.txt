Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list provided, we'll examine each node:

- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-star: <1, (4, 5, 9)>

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 5, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-star: <2, (0, 4, 5)>, <2, (0, 4, 6)>, <2, (0, 5, 6)>, <2, (4, 5, 6)>

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 7, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-star: <3, (5, 6, 7)>, <3, (5, 6, 8)>, <3, (5, 7, 8)>, <3, (6, 7, 8)>

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-star: <4, (1, 2, 5)>

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3, 4, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - 3-star: <5, (1, 2, 4)>, <5, (1, 2, 9)>, <5, (1, 4, 9)>, <5, (2, 4, 9)>, <5, (1, 3, 4)>, <5, (1, 3, 9)>, <5, (1, 4, 9)>, <5, (3, 4, 9)>, <5, (2, 3, 4)>, <5, (2, 3, 9)>

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 7, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-star: <6, (2, 3, 7)>, <6, (2, 3, 8)>, <6, (2, 7, 8)>, <6, (3, 7, 8)>

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {3, 6, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-star: <7, (3, 6, 9)>

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {3, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 5, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-star: <9, (1, 5, 7)>, <9, (1, 5, 9)>, <9, (1, 7, 9)>, <9, (5, 7, 9)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 10
- <6, (2, 3, 7)>, <6, (2, 3, 8)>, <6, (2, 7, 8)>, <6, (3, 7, 8)>
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 = 25

Therefore, there are a total of [25] 3-stars in your graph.
