Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list provided, we will evaluate each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {3} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - <1, (3, 4, 9)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {6, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 4, 5, 7, 9} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
  - <3, (0, 1, 4)>, <3, (0, 1, 5)>, <3, (0, 1, 7)>, <3, (0, 1, 9)>, <3, (0, 4, 5)>, <3, (0, 4, 7)>, <3, (0, 4, 9)>, <3, (0, 5, 7)>, <3, (0, 5, 9)>, <3, (0, 7, 9)>, <3, (1, 4, 5)>, <3, (1, 4, 7)>, <3, (1, 4, 9)>, <3, (1, 5, 7)>, <3, (1, 5, 9)>, <3, (1, 7, 9)>, <3, (4, 5, 7)>, <3, (4, 5, 9)>, <3, (4, 7, 9)>, <3, (5, 7, 9)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {3, 6, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - <5, (3, 6, 8)>, <5, (3, 6, 9)>, <5, (3, 8, 9)>, <5, (6, 8, 9)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {2, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {3, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
  - <9, (1, 2, 3)>, <9, (1, 2, 5)>, <9, (1, 2, 7)>, <9, (1, 2, 8)>, <9, (1, 3, 5)>, <9, (1, 3, 7)>, <9, (1, 3, 8)>, <9, (1, 5, 7)>, <9, (1, 5, 8)>, <9, (1, 7, 8)>, <9, (2, 3, 5)>, <9, (2, 3, 7)>, <9, (2, 3, 8)>, <9, (2, 5, 7)>, <9, (2, 5, 8)>, <9, (2, 7, 8)>, <9, (3, 5, 7)>, <9, (3, 5, 8)>, <9, (3, 7, 8)>, <9, (5, 7, 8)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 3: 20
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 9: 20
Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 20 + 4 + 20 = 45
Therefore, there are a total of [45] 3-stars in your graph.
