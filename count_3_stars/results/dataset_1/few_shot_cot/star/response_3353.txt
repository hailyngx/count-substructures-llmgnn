Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {3, 6, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - Unique 3-star: <0, (3, 6, 7)>
  
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {9} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 5, 7, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - Unique 3-stars: <3, (0, 7, 9)>, <3, (0, 5, 7)>, <3, (5, 7, 9)>, <3, (0, 5, 9)>
  
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - Unique 3-star: <7, (0, 3, 8)>
  
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 7, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - Unique 3-stars: <8, (4, 6, 7)>, <8, (6, 7, 9)>, <8, (4, 7, 9)>, <8, (6, 7, 9)>
  
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - Unique 3-star: <9, (2, 3, 8)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 1
Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 11

Therefore, there are a total of [11] 3-stars in your graph.
