Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 5) (3, 1) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 5
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {9} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {6} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 7**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {9} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
- From Node 6: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1
Therefore, there are a total of [1] 3-star in your graph.
