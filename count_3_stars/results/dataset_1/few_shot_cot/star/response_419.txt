Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 
  - 3-star: <0, (5, 6, 7)>

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\) 
  - 3-star: <1, (2, 8, 9)>, <1, (3, 7, 8)>, <1, (3, 8, 9)>, <1, (5, 7, 9)>, <1, (5, 8, 9)>

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 5, 6, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 
  - 3-star: <2, (1, 6, 9)>, <2, (3, 5, 9)>

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 
  - 3-star: <3, (1, 2, 5)>

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9} (8 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{8}{3} = 56\) 
  - 3-star: <5, (0, 6, 9)>, <5, (1, 4, 9)>, <5, (1, 6, 9)>, <5, (2, 4, 9)>, <5, (2, 6, 9)>, <5, (3, 4, 7)>, <5, (3, 4, 9)>, <5, (3, 6, 9)>, <5, (4, 6, 7)>, <5, (4, 6, 9)>

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 5, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 
  - 3-star: <6, (0, 5, 9)>, <6, (2, 5, 9)>

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 4, 5} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 
  - 3-star: <7, (0, 5, 6)>, <7, (1, 5, 9)>

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 5, 6, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 
  - 3-star: <9, (1, 2, 8)>, <9, (1, 3, 8)>, <9, (1, 5, 8)>, <9, (2, 5, 8)>, <9, (6, 5, 8)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 20
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 5: 56
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 9: 10
Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 20 + 10 + 1 + 56 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 106
Therefore, there are a total of [106] 3-stars in your graph.
