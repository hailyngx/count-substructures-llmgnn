Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 3

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:  
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {3, 4} (2 neighbors)  
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.  
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 6} (2 neighbors)  
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.  
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)  
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)  
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 9} (2 neighbors)  
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.  
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 6} (2 neighbors)  
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.  
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 7} (3 neighbors)  
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)  
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 4} (2 neighbors)  
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.  
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)  
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.  
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)  
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.  
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {2, 3} (2 neighbors)  
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.  

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:  
Since Node 2 and Node 5 each contribute to 1 unique 3-star configuration, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 2.  

Therefore, there are a total of [2] 3-stars in your graph.
