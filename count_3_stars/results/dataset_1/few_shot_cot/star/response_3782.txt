Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 7, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = inom{4}{3} = 4
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 4, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = inom{4}{3} = 4
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 5, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = inom{4}{3} = 4
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 6, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = inom{4}{3} = 4
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 6, 7, 8, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = inom{5}{3} = 10
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 6, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = inom{4}{3} = 4
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = inom{3}{3} = 1
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 4, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = inom{4}{3} = 4
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 3, 4} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = inom{4}{3} = 4
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 5, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = inom{4}{3} = 4

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 43

Therefore, there are a total of [43] 3-stars in your graph.
