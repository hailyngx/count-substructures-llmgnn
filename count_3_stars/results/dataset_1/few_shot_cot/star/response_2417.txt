Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 6

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {3, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - <0, (3, 8, 9)>

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 2**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 5, 7, 8, 9} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3}\) = 20
  - <3, (0, 8, 9)>, <3, (0, 9, 8)>, <3, (8, 0, 9)>, <3, (8, 9, 0)>, <3, (9, 0, 8)>, <3, (9, 8, 0)>, <3, (5, 7, 9)>, <3, (5, 9, 7)>, <3, (7, 5, 9)>, <3, (7, 9, 5)>, <3, (9, 5, 7)>, <3, (9, 7, 5)>, <3, (0, 8, 3)>, <3, (0, 3, 8)>, <3, (8, 0, 3)>, <3, (8, 3, 0)>, <3, (3, 0, 8)>, <3, (3, 8, 0)>, <3, (0, 9, 3)>, <3, (0, 3, 9)>, <3, (9, 0, 3)>

- **Node 4**: No neighbors
   - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {3, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - <6, (5, 7, 9)>

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {3, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - <9, (0, 3, 6)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 3: 20
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 9: 1
Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 20 + 1 + 1 = 23

Therefore, there are a total of [23] 3-stars in your graph.
