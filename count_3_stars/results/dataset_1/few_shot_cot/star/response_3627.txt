Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 4

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {7, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {8, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 7, 8, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - <4, (1, 2, 7)>, <4, (1, 2, 8)>, <4, (1, 2, 9)>, <4, (1, 7, 8)>, <4, (1, 7, 9)>, <4, (1, 8, 9)>, <4, (2, 7, 8)>, <4, (2, 7, 9)>, <4, (2, 8, 9)>, <4, (7, 8, 9)>
- **Node 5**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 6**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <8, (0, 3, 4)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {3, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 8: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 = 11

Therefore, there are a total of [11] 3-stars in your graph.
