Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 6

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Unique 3-star: <0, (2, 5, 6)>
  
- **Node 1**: Not connected to any other nodes (0 neighbors).
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
  
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Unique 3-star: <2, (0, 8, 9)>
  
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {6, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 4**: Not connected to any other nodes (0 neighbors).
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
  
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Unique 3-star: <6, (0, 3, 9)>
  
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {3, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {2, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 0: 1 3-star
- From Node 2: 1 3-star
- From Node 6: 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3

Therefore, there are a total of [3] 3-stars in your graph.
