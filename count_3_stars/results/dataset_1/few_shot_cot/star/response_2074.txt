Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 6, 7, and node 8

Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 4

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 6, 7, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-Stars: <1, (2, 6, 7)>, <1, (2, 6, 8)>, <1, (2, 7, 8)>, <1, (6, 7, 8)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9} (7 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{7}{3} = 35\)
  - 3-Stars: <2, (1, 4, 6)>, <2, (1, 4, 7)>, <2, (1, 4, 9)>, <2, (1, 6, 7)>, <2, (1, 6, 8)>, <2, (1, 7, 8)>, <2, (4, 5, 6)>, <2, (4, 5, 7)>, <2, (4, 5, 9)>, <2, (4, 6, 7)>, <2, (4, 6, 9)>, <2, (4, 7, 9)>, <2, (5, 6, 8)>, <2, (5, 7, 8)>, <2, (6, 7, 8)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-Stars: <3, (2, 4, 6)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 3, 7, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - 3-Stars: <4, (0, 2, 7)>, <4, (0, 2, 9)>, <4, (0, 3, 7)>, <4, (0, 3, 9)>, <4, (2, 3, 7)>, <4, (2, 3, 9)>, <4, (2, 7, 9)>, <4, (3, 7, 9)>, <4, (7, 8, 9)>, <4, (7, 8, 4)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-Stars: <6, (1, 2, 3)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 4, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-Stars: <7, (1, 2, 8)>, <7, (1, 4, 8)>, <7, (2, 4, 8)>, <7, (4, 8, 9)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 5, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-Stars: <8, (1, 5, 7)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-Stars: <9, (0, 2, 4)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 35 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 58

Therefore, there are a total of [58] 3-stars in your graph.
