Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 2) (7, 4) (9, 2) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 4
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 4

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {6, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 7, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <4, (0, 3, 7)>, <4, (0, 3, 9)>, <4, (0, 7, 9)>, <4, (3, 7, 9)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {3} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {2, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
The total number of 3-stars found is 4.

Therefore, there are a total of [4] 3-stars in your graph.
