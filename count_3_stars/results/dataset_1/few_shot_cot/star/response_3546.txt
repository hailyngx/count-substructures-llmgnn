Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 5
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {6} (1 neighbor)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: No neighbors
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {3, 7} (2 neighbors)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 8} (2 neighbors)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5, 8} (2 neighbors)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2, 6, 7, 9} (4 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {2, 8} (2 neighbors)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 8: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 = 5

Therefore, there are a total of [5] 3-stars in your graph.
