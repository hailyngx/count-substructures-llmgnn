Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
        Given the adjacency list provided, we'll examine each node:
        - **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor)
        - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
        - **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 5, 8} (4 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
        - **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 9} (2 neighbors)
        - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
        - **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 9} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
        - **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 3} (2 neighbors)
        - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
        - **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 6, 8} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
        - **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 9} (2 neighbors)
        - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
        - **Node 7**: No neighbors
        - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
        - **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 5, 9} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
        - **Node 9**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 6, 8} (4 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
        
        Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
        Add up all the valid configurations:
        - From Node 1: 4
        - From Node 3: 1
        - From Node 5: 1
        - From Node 8: 1
        - From Node 9: 4
        Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 11
        Therefore, there are a total of [11] 3-stars in your graph. 

        <1, (2, 3, 5)>
        <1, (2, 3, 8)>
        <1, (2, 5, 8)>
        <1, (3, 5, 8)>
        <9, (2, 3, 8)>
        <9, (2, 5, 8)>
        <9, (3, 5, 8)>
        <3, (1, 4, 9)>
        <5, (1, 6, 8)>
        <8, (1, 5, 9)>
        <8, (5, 9, 1)>
        
        This count represents how many unique 3-star subgraphs can be formed based on the adjacency list provided.
