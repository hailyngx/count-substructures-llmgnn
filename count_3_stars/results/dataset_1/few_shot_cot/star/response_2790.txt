Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3

Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 6

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {3} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {6, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-star: <1, (6, 8, 9)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-star: <2, (5, 6, 7)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3, 8, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - Unique 3-stars:
    - <6, (1, 8, 9)>
    - <6, (2, 3, 8)>
    - <6, (2, 8, 9)>
    - <6, (3, 8, 9)>
    - <6, (1, 8, 2)>
    - <6, (1, 8, 9)>
    - <6, (1, 2, 8)>
    - <6, (1, 2, 9)>
    - <6, (1, 9, 8)>
    - <6, (1, 2, 9)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-star: <9, (1, 4, 6)>
  
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 13

Therefore, there are a total of [13] 3-stars in your graph.
