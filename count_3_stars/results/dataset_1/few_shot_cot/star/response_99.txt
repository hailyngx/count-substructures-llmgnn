Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 5

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3, 4} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 7} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 6, 9} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 5, 6, 8, 9} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {3, 9} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 7} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 6} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {3} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 5} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 17

Therefore, there are a total of [17] 3-stars in your graph.
