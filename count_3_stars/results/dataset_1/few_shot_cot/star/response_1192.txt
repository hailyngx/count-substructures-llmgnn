Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 5, 7, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - <4, (0, 2, 7)>, <4, (0, 2, 9)>, <4, (0, 5, 7)>, <4, (0, 5, 9)>, <4, (2, 5, 7)>, <4, (2, 5, 9)>, <4, (5, 7, 9)>, <4, (0, 2, 5)>, <4, (0, 7, 9)>, <4, (2, 7, 9)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 4, 6, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - <5, (1, 3, 8)>, <5, (1, 4, 8)>, <5, (1, 6, 8)>, <5, (3, 4, 8)>, <5, (3, 6, 8)>, <5, (4, 6, 8)>, <5, (1, 3, 4)>, <5, (1, 3, 6)>, <5,(1, 4, 6)>, <5, (3, 4, 6)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 5, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <6, (2, 5, 8)>, <6, (3, 5, 8)>, <6, (2, 3, 5)>, <6, (2, 3, 8)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 5, 6, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <8, (1, 5, 9)>, <8, (1, 6, 9)>, <8, (5, 6, 9)>, <8, (1, 5, 6)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {4, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 8: 4
Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 28

Therefore, there are a total of [28] 3-stars in your graph.
