Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 6, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Possible 3-stars: <1, (2, 5, 6)>, <1, (2, 5, 8)>, <1, (2, 6, 8)>, <1, (5, 6, 8)>
  
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 8} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
  - Possible 3-stars: <2, (0, 1, 3)>, <2, (0, 1, 5)>, <2, (0, 1, 7)>, <2, (0, 1, 8)>, <2, (0, 3, 5)>, <2, (0, 3, 7)>, <2, (0, 3, 8)>, <2, (0, 5, 7)>, <2, (0, 5, 8)>, <2, (0, 7, 8)>, <2, (1, 3, 5)>, <2, (1, 3, 7)>,<2, (1, 3, 8)>, <2, (1, 5, 7)>, <2, (1, 5, 8)>, <2, (1, 7, 8)>, <2, (3, 5, 7)>,<2, (3, 5, 8)>, <2, (3, 7, 8)>, <2, (5, 7, 8)>
  
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2, 7, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Possible 3-stars: <3, (2, 7, 8)>, <3, (2, 7, 9)>, <3, (2, 8, 9)>, <3, (7, 8, 9)>
  
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 4, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Possible 3-stars: <5, (1, 2, 4)>, <5, (1, 2, 6)>, <5, (1, 4, 6)>, <5, (2, 4, 6)>
  
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 5, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 4, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Possible 3-stars: <7, (2, 3, 4)>, <7, (2, 3, 6)>, <7, (2, 4, 6)>, <7, (3, 4, 6)>
  
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {3, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 20
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 7: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 36

Therefore, there are a total of [36] 3-stars in your graph.
