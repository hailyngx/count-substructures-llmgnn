Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
        Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
        - **Node 0**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 6} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
        - **Node 1**: Neighbors = {6, 8} (2 neighbors)
        - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
        - **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 7} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
        - **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 9} (2 neighbors)
        - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
        - **Node 4**: Neighbors = {2, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
        - **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 2} (2 neighbors)
        - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
        - **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 7, 8, 9} (5 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
        - **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2, 6} (2 neighbors)
        - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
        - **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 6} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
        - **Node 9**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 6} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
        
        Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
        Add up all the valid configurations:
        - From Node 0: 1
        - From Node 2: 1
        - From Node 4: 1
        - From Node 6: 10
        - From Node 8: 1
        - From Node 9: 1
        
        Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 15
        Therefore, there are a total of [15] 3-stars in your graph.
