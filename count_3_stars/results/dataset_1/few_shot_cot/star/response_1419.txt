Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 4

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {6, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 6, 7, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - 3-stars: <2, (3, 5, 6)>, <2, (3, 6, 7)>, <2, (3, 6, 9)>, <2, (3, 7, 9)>, <2, (5, 6, 7)>, <2, (5, 6, 9)>, <2, (5, 7, 9)>, <2, (6, 7, 9)>, <2, (5, 6, 7)>, <2, (5, 6, 9)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-star: <3, (2, 5, 8)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-star: <5, (2, 3, 6)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 5, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-stars: <6, (1, 2, 5)>, <6, (1, 2, 8)>, <6, (1, 5, 8)>, <6, (2, 5, 8)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-star: <7, (0, 2, 4)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {3, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-star: <9, (1, 2, 4)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 18

Therefore, there are a total of [18] 3-stars in your graph.
