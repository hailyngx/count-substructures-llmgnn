Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 7} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - <1, (0, 8, 9)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 7} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - <2, (4, 6, 7)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {2, 8} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {7, 8} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 3, 5, 9} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
    - <7, (0, 2, 9)>, <7, (0, 3, 9)>, <7, (0, 5, 9)>, <7, (2, 3, 9)>, <7, (2, 5, 9)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 5} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - <8, (1, 4, 5)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 7} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 13

Therefore, there are a total of [13] 3-stars in your graph.
