Node 6 is connected to node 1, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 4

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - 3-star: <1, (0, 2, 6)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 7, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - 3-star: <2, (1, 7, 8)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 5, 7, 8, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
  - 3-star configurations: <3, (0, 5, 7)>, <3, (0, 5, 8)>, <3, (0, 7, 8)>, <3, (5, 7, 8)>, <3, (0, 7, 9)>, <3, (0, 8, 9)>, <3, (5, 7, 9)>, <3, (5, 8, 9)>, <3, (7, 8, 9)>, <3, (0, 9, 4)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 6, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - 3-star configurations: <5, (3, 6, 7)>, <5, (3, 7, 4)>, <5, (3, 6, 4)>, <5, (6, 7, 4)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 5, 7, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - 3-star configurations: <6, (1, 7, 8)>, <6, (1, 5, 7)>, <6, (1, 5, 8)>, <6, (7, 5, 8)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 5, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - 3-star configurations: <7, (2, 3, 5)>, <7, (2, 5, 6)>, <7, (2, 3, 6)>, <7, (3, 5, 6)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - 3-star: <8, (2, 3, 6)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {3, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 25

Therefore, there are a total of [25] 3-stars in your graph.
