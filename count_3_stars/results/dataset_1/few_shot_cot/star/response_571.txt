Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 3

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {6, 7, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {9} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {2, 7, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {2, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3

Therefore, there are a total of [3] 3-stars in your graph.
