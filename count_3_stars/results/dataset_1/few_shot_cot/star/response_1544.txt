Node 8 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 4, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Unique 3-stars: <0, (1, 3, 4)>, <0, (1, 4, 7)>, <0, (3, 4, 7)>, <0, (1, 3, 7)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 4, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Unique 3-stars: <1, (0, 2, 4)>, <1, (0, 4, 8)>, <1, (2, 4, 8)>, <1, (0, 2, 8)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Unique 3-star: <3, (0, 4, 7)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 3, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Unique 3-stars: <4, (0, 1, 3)>, <4, (0, 1, 7)>, <4, (0, 3, 7)>, <4, (1, 3, 7)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {8, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Not connected to any nodes.
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 4, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Unique 3-stars: <7, (0, 3, 4)>, <7, (0, 4, 8)>, <7, (3, 4, 8)>, <7, (0, 3, 8)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 5, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Unique 3-star: <8, (1, 5, 7)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 18

Therefore, there are a total of [18] 3-stars in your graph. These are the unique 3-star configurations based on the given adjacency list.
