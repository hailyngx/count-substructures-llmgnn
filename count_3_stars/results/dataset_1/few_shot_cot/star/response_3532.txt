Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 1

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 5, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 5, 6, 7, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {2, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 1} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 6, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 1} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 16

Therefore, there are a total of [16] 3-stars in your graph.
