Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 4

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: No neighbors
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 5} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
    - Unique 3-stars: <1, (2, 4, 5)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 7, 9} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
    - Unique 3-stars: <2, (1, 7, 9)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {9} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 7, 9} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
    - Unique 3-stars: <4, (1, 7, 9)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 8} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: No neighbors
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2, 4} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 4} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
    - Unique 3-stars: <9, (2, 3, 4)>
  
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4

Therefore, there are a total of [4] 3-stars in your graph.
