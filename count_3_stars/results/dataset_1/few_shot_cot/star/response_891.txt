Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 2} (2 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = Not enough neighbors to form a 3-star.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - <1, (0, 3, 4)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 5, 6, 7, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
  - <2, (0, 5, 6)>, <2, (0, 6, 7)>, <2, (0, 7, 8)>, <2, (5, 6, 8)>, <2, (6, 7, 8)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 5, 6, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - <3, (1, 5, 6)>, <3, (1, 6, 8)>, <3, (5, 6, 8)>, <3, (6, 7, 8)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 6, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - <4, (1, 6, 7)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - <5, (2, 3, 8)>, <5, (2, 8, 9)>, <5, (3, 6, 8)>, <5, (6, 8, 9)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 4, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - <6, (2, 3, 8)>, <6, (2, 8, 9)>, <6, (3, 6, 8)>, <6, (6, 8, 9)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - <7, (2, 4, 8)>, <7, (2, 8, 9)>, <7, (4, 6, 8)>, <7, (6, 8, 9)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3}\) = 20
  - <8, (2, 3, 5)>, <8, (2, 5, 6)>, <8, (2, 6, 7)>, <8, (2, 7, 9)>, <8, (3, 5, 9)>, <8, (5, 6, 9)>, <8, (6, 7, 9)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - <9, (5, 7, 8)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Adding up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 20
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 1 = 49

Therefore, there are a total of [49] 3-stars in your graph.
