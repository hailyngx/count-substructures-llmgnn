Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {6, 7, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <2, (6, 7, 9)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <4, (0, 3, 5)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 4, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <5, (1, 3, 4)>, <5, (1, 3, 7)>, <5, (1, 4, 7)>, <5, (3, 4, 7)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <6, (1, 2, 7)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 6, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <7, (2, 5, 6)>, <7, (2, 5, 9)>, <7, (2, 6, 9)>, <7, (5, 6, 9)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbor = {0} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {2, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 11

Therefore, there are a total of [11] 3-stars in your graph.
