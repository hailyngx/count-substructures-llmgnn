Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 5

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-Star: <1, (0, 4, 7)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {8, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-Star: <3, (4, 7, 9)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 6, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-Stars: <4, (1, 3, 6)>, <4, (1, 3, 9)>, <4, (1, 6, 9)>, <4, (3, 6, 9)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {6, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 7, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-Stars: <6, (4, 5, 7)>, <6, (4, 5, 8)>, <6, (4, 7, 8)>, <6, (5, 7, 8)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-Star: <7, (1, 3, 6)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-Star: <8, (0, 2, 6)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 4, 5} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-Stars: <9, (2, 3, 4)>, <9, (2, 3, 5)>, <9, (2, 4, 5)>, <9, (3, 4, 5)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 16

Therefore, there are a total of [16] 3-stars in your graph.
