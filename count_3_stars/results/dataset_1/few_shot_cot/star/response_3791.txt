Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 5

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {6, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 7, 8, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - Possible 3-stars: <1, (4, 7, 9)>, <1, (4, 8, 9)>, <1, (6, 7, 9)>, <1, (6, 8, 9)>, <1, (7, 8, 9)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 5, 7, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - Possible 3-stars: <2, (3, 5, 7)>, <2, (3, 5, 8)>, <2, (4, 5, 7)>, <2, (4, 5, 8)>, <2, (7, 5, 8)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 6, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Possible 3-stars: <3, (5, 6, 7)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 4, 8, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - Possible 3-stars: <5, (2, 4, 8)>, <5, (2, 8, 9)>, <5, (3, 4, 8)>, <5, (3, 8, 9)>, <5, (4, 8, 9)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Possible 3-stars: <7, (1, 2, 8)>, <7, (1, 3, 8)>, <7, (2, 3, 8)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2, 5, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - Possible 3-stars: <8, (0, 1, 7)>, <8, (0, 2, 7)>, <8, (1, 2, 7)>, <8, (1, 5, 7)>, <8, (2, 5, 7)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 10
Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 48

Therefore, there are a total of [48] 3-stars in your graph.
