Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (2, 0) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 6, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 1**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <4, (0, 3, 8)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {6, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <8, (0, 4, 7)>
- **Node 9**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 8: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6

Therefore, there are a total of [6] 3-stars in your graph.
