Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, and node 6

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 5, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <0, (1, 3, 5)>, <0, (1, 3, 9)>, <0, (1, 5, 9)>, <0, (3, 5, 9)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 5, 7, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <1, (0, 5, 7)>, <1, (0, 5, 9)>, <1, (0, 7, 9)>, <1, (5, 7, 9)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 5, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <3, (0, 5, 8)>, <3, (0, 5, 9)>, <3, (0, 8, 9)>, <3, (5, 8, 9)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2, 3, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <5, (0, 1, 2)>, <5, (0, 1, 3)>, <5, (0, 1, 8)>, <5, (0, 2, 3)>, <5, (0, 2, 8)>, <5, (0, 3, 8)>, <5, (1, 2, 3)>, <5, (1, 2, 8)>, <5, (1, 3, 8)>, <5, (2, 3, 8)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {3, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2, 3, 6} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <9, (0, 1, 2)>, <9, (0, 1, 3)>, <9, (0, 1, 6)>, <9, (0, 2, 3)>, <9, (0, 2, 6)>, <9, (0, 3, 6)>, <9, (1, 2, 3)>, <9, (1, 2, 6)>, <9, (1, 3, 6)>, <9, (2, 3, 6)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 9: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 32

Therefore, there are a total of [32] 3-stars in your graph.
