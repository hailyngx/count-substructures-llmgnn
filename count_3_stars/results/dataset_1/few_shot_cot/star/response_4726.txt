Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 6, 7} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 5, 8} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 3} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 2} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 7} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 6, 8} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2, 7} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: No neighbors
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 7: 1
Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6
Therefore, there are a total of [6] 3-stars in your graph.
