Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 2

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 4} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 7, 9} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 8} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: No neighbors
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 6**: No neighbors
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2, 3} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 4} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 2: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1

Therefore, there are a total of [1] 3-stars in your graph.
