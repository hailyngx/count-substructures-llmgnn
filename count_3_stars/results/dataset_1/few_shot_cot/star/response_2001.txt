Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 4, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {6, 7, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 7, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 5, 6, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 8**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 22

Therefore, there are a total of [22] 3-stars in your graph.
