Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 5} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 8} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 8} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 5, 7} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 3, 4, 7, 8} (6 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 6**: No neighbors
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 5} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 5, 9} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 20
- From Node 8: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 20 + 4 = 26

Therefore, there are a total of [26] 3-stars in your graph.
