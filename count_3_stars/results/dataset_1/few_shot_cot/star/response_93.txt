Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 6
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 2

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Possible 3-stars: <2, (5, 8, 9)>, <5, (2, 8, 9)>, <8, (2, 5, 9)>, <9, (2, 5, 8)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {6} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Not connected to any other nodes.
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Possible 3-stars: <5, (0, 2, 8)>, <0, (5, 2, 8)>, <2, (5, 0, 8)>, <8, (5, 0, 2)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Possible 3-star: <6, (2, 3, 7)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 5: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 = 9

Therefore, there are a total of [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
