Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 7
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 7} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 1**: Not connected to any nodes, so cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 5, 7} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 6} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 3} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {9} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 5: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
Therefore, there are a total of [3] 3-stars in your graph.
