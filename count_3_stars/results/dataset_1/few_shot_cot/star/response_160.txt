Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 6, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: No neighbors, cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 2**: No neighbors, cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor), cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {6, 8} (2 neighbors), cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 8} (2 neighbors), cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {4, 9} (2 neighbors), cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 3} (2 neighbors), cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 5, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {6, 8} (2 neighbors), cannot form a 3-star.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 8: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 = 5

Therefore, there are a total of [5] 3-stars in the graph.
