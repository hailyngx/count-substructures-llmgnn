Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 6

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 5, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 7, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {3, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 7, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 4, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 18

Therefore, there are a total of [18] 3-stars in your graph.
