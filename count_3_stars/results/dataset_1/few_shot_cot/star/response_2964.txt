Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 5, 6, 8, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
  - 3-Stars: <0, (1, 5, 6)>, <0, (1, 5, 8)>, <0, (1, 6, 8)>, <0, (5, 6, 8)>, <0, (1, 5, 9)>, <0, (1, 6, 9)>, <0, (1, 8, 9)>, <0, (5, 6, 8)>, <0, (5, 8, 9)>, <0, (6, 8, 9)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 5, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - 3-Stars: <2, (3, 4, 5)>, <2, (3, 4, 8)>, <2, (3, 5, 8)>, <2, (4, 5, 8)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 5, 6, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
  - 3-Stars: <3, (2, 4, 5)>, <3, (2, 4, 7)>, <3, (2, 5, 7)>, <3, (4, 5, 7)>, <3, (2, 5, 8)>, <3, (2, 7, 8)>, <3, (4, 5, 8)>, <3, (4, 7, 8)>, <3, (5, 7, 8)>, <3, (2, 5, 8)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 6, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - 3-Stars: <4, (2, 3, 6)>, <4, (2, 3, 9)>, <4, (2, 6, 9)>, <4, (3, 6, 9)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 3, 7, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
  - 3-Stars: <5, (0, 2, 3)>, <5, (0, 2, 8)>, <5, (0, 3, 7)>, <5, (0, 3, 8)>, <5, (0, 7, 8)>, <5, (2, 7, 8)>, <5, (3, 7, 8)>, <5, (2, 3, 7)>, <5, (2, 3, 8)>, <5, (3, 7, 8)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 3, 4, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
  - 3-Stars: <6, (0, 1, 3)>, <6, (0, 1, 4)>, <6, (0, 1, 7)>, <6, (0, 3, 7)>, <6, (0, 4, 7)>, <6, (1, 3, 4)>, <6, (1, 3, 7)>, <6, (1, 4, 7)>, <6, (3, 4, 7)>, <6, (1, 3, 4)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 6, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - 3-Stars: <7, (3, 5, 6)>, <7, (3, 5, 8)>, <7, (3, 6, 8)>, <7, (5, 6, 8)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 5, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - 3-Stars: <8, (0, 2, 5)>, <8, (0, 2, 7)>, <8, (0, 5, 7)>, <8, (2, 5, 7)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Adding up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 56

Therefore, there are a total of [56] 3-stars in your graph.
