Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 5

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 5, 6, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 5, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 6, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3, 4, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3, 4, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 7**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {6} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 = 37

Therefore, there are a total of [37] 3-stars in your graph.
