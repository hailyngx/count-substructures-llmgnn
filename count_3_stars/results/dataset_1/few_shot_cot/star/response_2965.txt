Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 4, 7} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - Unique 3-stars: <0, (1, 2, 4)>, <0, (1, 2, 7)>, <0, (1, 4, 7)>, <0, (2, 4, 7)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 5, 6} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - Unique 3-stars: <1, (0, 2, 5)>, <1, (0, 2, 6)>, <1, (0, 5, 6)>, <1, (2, 5, 6)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 4, 6, 9} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    - Unique 3-stars: <2, (0, 1, 4)>, <2, (0, 1, 6)>, <2, (0, 4, 6)>, <2, (0, 6, 9)>, <2, (1, 4, 6)>, <2, (1, 4, 9)>, <2, (1, 6, 9)>, <2, (4, 6, 9)>, <2, (4, 6, 9)>, <2, (1, 6, 9)>
- **Node 3**: No neighbors, cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 6} (3 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 6, 8} (3 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9} (6 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
    - Unique 3-stars: <6, (1, 2, 4)>, <6, (1, 2, 5)>, <6, (1, 2, 8)>, <6, (1, 2, 9)>, <6, (1, 4, 5)>, <6, (1, 4, 8)>, <6, (1, 4, 9)>, <6, (1, 5, 8)>, <6, (1, 5, 9)>, <6, (1, 8, 9)>, <6, (2, 4, 5)>, <6, (2, 4, 8)>, <6, (2, 4, 9)>, <6, (2, 5, 8)>, <6, (2, 5, 9)>, <6, (2, 8, 9)>, <6, (4, 5, 8)>, <6, (4, 5, 9)>, <6, (4, 8, 9)>, <6, (5, 8, 9)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbor = {0} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5, 6} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {2, 6} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Adding up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 6: 20

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 10 + 20 = 38

Therefore, there are a total of [38] 3-stars in your graph.
