Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (5, 1) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {3, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Possible 3-stars: <7, (0, 3, 9)>, <7, (0, 3, 8)>, <7, (3, 8, 9)>, <7, (0, 8, 9)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 6, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Possible 3-stars: <8, (1, 2, 6)>, <8, (1, 2, 7)>, <8, (1, 6, 7)>, <8, (2, 6, 7)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 = 8

Therefore, there are a total of [8] 3-stars in your graph.
