Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 7, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 7, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 4**: Not connected to any other nodes.
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2, 6, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 6, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 5, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
  - From Node 0: 4
  - From Node 1: 1
  - From Node 3: 4
  - From Node 5: 4
  - From Node 6: 1
  - From Node 7: 4
  - From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 22

Therefore, there are a total of [22] 3-stars in your graph.
