Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 5

Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 5, 6, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
    - <1, (2, 3, 5)> 
    - <1, (2, 5, 6)>
    - <1, (2, 5, 8)>
    - <1, (3, 5, 8)>
    - <1, (5, 6, 8)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 4, 6, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
    - <2, (1, 3, 4)>
    - <2, (1, 3, 6)>
    - <2, (1, 4, 6)>
    - <2, (3, 4, 7)>
    - <2, (4, 6, 7)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 5, 8, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
    - <4, (0, 2, 5)>
    - <4, (0, 2, 8)>
    - <4, (0, 5, 9)>
    - <4, (2, 5, 8)>
    - <4, (5, 8, 9)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 4, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - <5, (0, 1, 4)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 2} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 4, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - <8, (1, 3, 4)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {4, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 1: 5 unique 3-stars
- From Node 2: 5 unique 3-stars
- From Node 4: 5 unique 3-stars
- From Node 5: 1 unique 3-star
- From Node 8: 1 unique 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 5 + 5 + 5 + 1 + 1 = 17

Therefore, there are a total of [17] 3-stars in your graph.
