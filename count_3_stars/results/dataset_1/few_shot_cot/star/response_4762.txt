Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 7, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Possible 3-stars: <0, (2, 5, 7)>, <0, (2, 5, 9)>, <0, (2, 7, 9)>, <0, (5, 7, 9)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {7, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {6, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Possible 3-star: <3, (6, 8, 9)>
- **Node 4**: Not connected to any other nodes.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Possible 3-star: <5, (0, 2, 8)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {3, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 1} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 5, 6, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - Possible 3-stars: <8, (1, 3, 5)>, <8, (1, 3, 6)>, <8, (1, 3, 9)>, <8, (1, 5, 6)>, <8, (1, 5, 9)>, <8, (1, 6, 9)>, <8, (3, 5, 6)>, <8, (3, 5, 9)>, <8, (3, 6, 9)>, <8, (5, 6, 9)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Possible 3-star: <9, (0, 3, 8)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Adding up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 17
Therefore, there are a total of [17] 3-stars in your graph.
