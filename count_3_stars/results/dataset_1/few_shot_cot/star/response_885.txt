Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 5, 6, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {6} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 4, 8, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {3} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 2} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {3} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {3, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
    
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 3: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 = 20

Therefore, there are a total of [20] 3-stars in your graph.
