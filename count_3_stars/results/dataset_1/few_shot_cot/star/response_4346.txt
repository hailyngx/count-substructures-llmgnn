Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 3
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 6
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4, 6} (2 neighbors)
   - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3} (1 neighbor)
   - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: No neighbors
   - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 6} (3 neighbors)
   - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
   - <3, (1, 4, 6)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 5} (3 neighbors)
   - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
   - <4, (0, 3, 5)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor)
   - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 7, 8} (4 neighbors)
   - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   - <6, (0, 3, 7)>, <6, (0, 3, 8)>, <6, (3, 7, 8)>, <6, (7, 8, 0)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {6} (1 neighbor)
   - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {6} (1 neighbor)
   - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: No neighbors
   - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 = 6

Therefore, there are a total of [6] 3-stars in your graph.
