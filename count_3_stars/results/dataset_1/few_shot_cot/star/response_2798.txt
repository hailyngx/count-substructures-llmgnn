Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 5

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {6} (1 neighbor) 
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor) 
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3, 7, 8} (3 neighbors) 
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 
  - Unique 3-star: <2, (3, 7, 8)>
  
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 7} (3 neighbors) 
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 
  - Unique 3-star: <3, (2, 4, 7)>
  
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 5, 8} (4 neighbors) 
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 
  - Unique 3-stars: <4, (1, 3, 5)>, <4, (1, 3, 8)>, <4, (1, 5, 8)>, <4, (3, 5, 8)>
  
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {4, 9} (2 neighbors) 
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0} (1 neighbor) 
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2, 3} (2 neighbors) 
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2, 4} (2 neighbors) 
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor) 
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 4

Therefore, there are a total of [6] 3-stars in your graph.
