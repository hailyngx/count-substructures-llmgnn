Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 4

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {9} (1 neighbor)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 8} (2 neighbors)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4, 9} (2 neighbors)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 7, 9} (4 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  <4, (1, 3, 7)>
  <4, (1, 3, 9)>
  <4, (1, 7, 9)>
  <4, (3, 7, 9)>
- **Node 5**: Not connected to any other nodes.
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Not connected to any other nodes.
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 8} (2 neighbors)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 7} (3 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  <8, (1, 2, 7)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 4} (3 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  <9, (0, 3, 4)>
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 1
Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6
Therefore, there are a total of [6] 3-stars in your graph.
