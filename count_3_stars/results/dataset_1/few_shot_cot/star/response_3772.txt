Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 4) (7, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 3

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: No neighbors
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 9} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 2**: No neighbors
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {7, 9} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 6, 8} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {3} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 3} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 4: 1
Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 = 2

Therefore, there are a total of [2] 3-stars in your graph.
