Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {3, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-star configurations: <2, (1, 4, 8)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 6, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-star configurations: <5, (1, 6, 9)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {6} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-star configurations: <8, (0, 2, 3)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 8: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3

Therefore, there are a total of [3] 3-stars in your graph.
