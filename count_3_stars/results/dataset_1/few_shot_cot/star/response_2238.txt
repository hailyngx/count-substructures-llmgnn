Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - <0, (3, 5, 7)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 5, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - <2, (1, 3, 5)>, <2, (1, 5, 8)>, <2, (3, 5, 8)>, <2, (1, 3, 8)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 2} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 5, 6, 7, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
  - <4, (1, 5, 7)>, <4, (1, 5, 8)>, <4, (1, 6, 7)>, <4, (1, 6, 8)>, <4, (5, 6, 7)>, <4, (5, 6, 8)>, <4, (5, 7, 8)>, <4, (6, 7, 8)>, <4, (1, 7, 8)>, <4, (5, 7, 8)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 4, 7, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
  - <5, (0, 4, 7)>, <5, (0, 4, 8)>, <5, (0, 7, 8)>, <5, (2, 4, 7)>, <5, (2, 4, 8)>, <5, (2, 5, 7)>, <5, (2, 5, 8)>, <5, (4, 7, 8)>, <5, (0, 2, 4)>, <5, (0, 2, 7)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {4, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - <6, (4, 8, 9)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - <7, (0, 4, 5)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 5, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - <8, (2, 4, 6)>, <8, (2, 4, 5)>, <8, (2, 5, 6)>, <8, (4, 5, 6)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {6} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 31

Therefore, there are a total of [31] 3-stars in your graph.
