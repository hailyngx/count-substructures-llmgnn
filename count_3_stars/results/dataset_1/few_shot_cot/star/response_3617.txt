Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 3
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 3

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 5, 6, 8, 9} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 4, 9} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 4, 6, 8} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2, 6, 9} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 2} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 3} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 7**: No neighbors
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 2} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 3} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 27
Therefore, there are a total of [27] 3-stars in your graph.
