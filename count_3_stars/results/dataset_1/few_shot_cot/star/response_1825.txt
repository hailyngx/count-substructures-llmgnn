Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 6) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {6} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {6, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {6} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {6} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 4, 5, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - Configuration: <6, (1, 4, 5)>, <6, (1, 4, 7)>, <6, (1, 5, 7)>, <6, (4, 5, 7)>, <6, (1, 4, 5)>, <6, (1, 4, 5)>, <6, (1, 4, 5)>, <6, (1, 4, 5)>, <6, (1, 4, 5)>, <6, (1, 4, 5)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {3, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
- From Node 6: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 10

Therefore, there are a total of [10] 3-stars in your graph.
