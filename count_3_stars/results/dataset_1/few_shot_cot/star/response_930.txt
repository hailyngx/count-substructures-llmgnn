Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 5, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-star: <0, (1, 5, 6)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-star: <1, (0, 2, 4)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 6, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-stars: <2, (1, 3, 6)>, <2, (1, 4, 8)>, <2, (3, 4, 8)>, <2, (4, 5, 8)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 5, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-stars: <3, (2, 4, 5)>, <3, (2, 5, 8)>, <3, (4, 5, 8)>, <3, (5, 8, 4)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 5, 7, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - 3-stars: <4, (1, 3, 5)>, <4, (1, 5, 7)>, <4, (1, 3, 8)>, <4, (3, 5, 7)>, <4, (3, 5, 8)>, <4, (5, 7, 8)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
  - 3-stars: <5, (0, 3, 6)>, <5, (3, 4, 8)>, <5, (4, 6, 8)>, <5, (6, 7, 8)>, <5, (3, 4, 5)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 5, 8, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - 3-stars: <6, (0, 5, 8)>, <6, (5, 8, 9)>, <6, (2, 5, 8)>, <6, (5, 6, 8)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 4, 5, 6} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - 3-stars: <8, (2, 4, 5)>, <8, (2, 3, 4)>, <8, (2, 3, 5)>, <8, (3, 4, 5)>, <8, (4, 5, 6)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {6} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 5: 20
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 8: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 10 = 60

Therefore, there are a total of [60] 3-stars in your graph.
