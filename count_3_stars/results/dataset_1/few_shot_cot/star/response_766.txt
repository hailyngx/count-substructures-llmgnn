Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - 3-star: <0, (1, 3, 4)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 6, 7, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - 3-stars: <1, (0, 6, 7)>, <1, (0, 6, 8)>, <1, (6, 7, 8)>, <1, (0, 7, 8)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - 3-star: <3, (0, 4, 6)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - 3-star: <4, (0, 3, 9)>
- **Node 5**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 7, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - 3-stars: <6, (1, 3, 7)>, <6, (1, 7, 8)>, <6, (3, 7, 8)>, <6, (1, 3, 8)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 6, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - 3-stars: <8, (1, 2, 6)>, <8, (1, 6, 9)>, <8, (2, 6, 9)>, <8, (1, 2, 9)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {4, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 8: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 15

Therefore, there are a total of [15] 3-stars in your graph.
