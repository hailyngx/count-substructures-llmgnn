Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 7
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 6

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {3, 7, 8} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \({{3}\choose{3}} = 1\)
    - 3-star configurations: <0, (3, 7, 8)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 7} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \({{3}\choose{3}} = 1\)
    - 3-star configurations: <1, (5, 6, 7)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3, 6} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 5, 7} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \({{4}\choose{3}} = 4\)
    - 3-star configurations: <3, (0, 2, 5)>, <3, (0, 2, 7)>, <3, (0, 5, 7)>, <3, (2, 5, 7)>
- **Node 4**: Not connected to any other nodes.
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 6} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \({{3}\choose{3}} = 1\)
    - 3-star configurations: <5, (1, 3, 6)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 5, 7, 9} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \({{5}\choose{3}} = 10\)
    - 3-star configurations: <6, (1, 2, 5)>, <6, (1, 2, 7)>, <6, (1, 5, 7)>, <6, (2, 5, 7)>, <6, (1, 5, 9)>, <6, (2, 5, 9)>, <6, (1, 7, 9)>, <6, (2, 7, 9)>, <6, (5, 7, 9)>, <6, (1, 5, 7)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 3, 6} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \({{4}\choose{3}} = 4\)
    - 3-star configurations: <7, (0, 1, 3)>, <7, (0, 1, 6)>, <7, (0, 3, 6)>, <7, (1, 3, 6)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {6} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 7: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 21

Therefore, there are a total of [21] 3-stars in your graph.
