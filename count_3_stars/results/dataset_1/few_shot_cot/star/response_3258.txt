Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (8, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 1
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list provided, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed for each node:

- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 6, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 7**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 9**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:

- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 3: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3

Therefore, there are a total of [3] 3-stars in your graph.
