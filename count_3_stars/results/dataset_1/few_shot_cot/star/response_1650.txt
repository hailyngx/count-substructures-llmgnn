Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 5, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Possible 3-stars: <3, (1, 2, 5)>, <3, (1, 5, 8)>, <3, (2, 5, 8)>, <3, (1, 2, 8)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {2, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 4, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Possible 3-stars: <5, (2, 3, 8)>, <5, (2, 4, 8)>, <5, (3, 4, 8)>, <5, (3, 8, 1)>
- **Node 6**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 7**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 5, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Possible 3-stars: <8, (1, 3, 9)>, <8, (1, 5, 9)>, <8, (3, 5, 9)>, <8, (1, 3, 5)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 8: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 13

Therefore, there are a total of [13] 3-stars in your graph.
