Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, 7, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8} (7 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{7}{3} = 35\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 7, 8, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {4, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 5, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 6, 7, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 4: 35
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 35 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 10 = 61

Therefore, there are a total of [61] 3-stars in your graph.
This count represents how many unique 3-star subgraphs can be formed based on the adjacency list provided.
