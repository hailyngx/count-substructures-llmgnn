Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 7
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {9} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {6} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Unique 3-star: <7, (3, 4, 8)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {6, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 7: 1
  
Total number of 3-stars = 1

Therefore, there are a total of [1] 3-stars in your graph.
