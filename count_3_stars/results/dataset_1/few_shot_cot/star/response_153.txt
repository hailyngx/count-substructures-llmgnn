Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: No neighbors. Cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - Unique 3-star: <1, (5, 7, 8)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 6, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - Unique 3-stars: <2, (3, 5, 6)>, <2, (3, 5, 7)>, <2, (5, 6, 7)>, <2, (3, 6, 7)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbor = {2} (1 neighbor). Cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {6, 8} (2 neighbors). Cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - Unique 3-star: <5, (1, 2, 8)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {2, 4} (2 neighbors). Cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - Unique 3-star: <7, (1, 2, 8)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 5, 7, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
  - Unique 3-stars: <8, (1, 5, 7)>, <8, (1, 5, 9)>, <8, (1, 7, 9)>, <8, (5, 7, 9)>, <8, (1, 7, 9)>, <8, (5, 7, 9)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbor = {8} (1 neighbor). Cannot form a 3-star.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Adding up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 17

Therefore, there are a total of [17] 3-stars in your graph.
