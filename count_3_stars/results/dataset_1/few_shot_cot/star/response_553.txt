Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 3

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Unique 3-star: <0, (3, 5, 6)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Unique 3-star: <1, (2, 3, 8)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 4, 5, 7, 9} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
  - Unique 3-stars: <3, (0, 5, 6)>, <3, (0, 7, 9)>, <3, (1,  4, 7)>, <3, (1, 5, 7)>, <3, (4, 5, 7)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {3, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Unique 3-star: <5, (0, 3, 7)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Unique 3-star: <6, (0, 4, 8)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Unique 3-star: <7, (3, 5, 8)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 6, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Unique 3-star: <8, (1, 6, 7)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {3} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 3: 5
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 20 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 26

Therefore, there are a total of [26] 3-stars in your graph.
