Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 4

Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 7, 8} (4 neighbors)
   - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {6, 9} (2 neighbors)
   - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9} (6 neighbors)
   - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 3**: No neighbors
   - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 9} (3 neighbors)
   - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
   - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 2} (2 neighbors)
   - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0} (1 neighbor)
   - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 2} (2 neighbors)
   - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 4} (3 neighbors)
   - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 2: 20
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 20 + 1 + 1 = 26

Therefore, there are a total of [26] 3-stars in your graph.
