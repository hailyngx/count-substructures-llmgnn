Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 2

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 9} (3 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {9} (1 neighbor)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 8} (3 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 5, 6} (4 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 7} (3 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 4, 8} (4 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {3, 6} (2 neighbors)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 2} (2 neighbors)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 11

Therefore, there are a total of [11] 3-stars in your graph.
