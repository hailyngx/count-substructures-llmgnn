Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 4, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 5, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 5, 7, 8, 9} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 3, 4, 6} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 5, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {4, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 4: 20
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 41

Therefore, there are a total of [41] 3-stars in your graph.
