Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 4) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 5
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 3

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 5} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 1**: No neighbors
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 7} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {9} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 5, 7, 8} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 6} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2, 4} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {3} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6

Therefore, there are a total of [6] 3-stars in your graph.
This count represents how many unique 3-star subgraphs can be formed based on the adjacency list provided.
