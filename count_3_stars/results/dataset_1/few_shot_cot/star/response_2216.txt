Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 5, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: No neighbors, cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 5, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor), cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 5, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 6**: No neighbors, cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2, 4} (2 neighbors), cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 9} (2 neighbors), cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 8} (2 neighbors), cannot form a 3-star.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
- From Node 1: 4 configurations
- From Node 2: 1 configuration
- From Node 4: 1 configuration 
- From Node 5: 1 configuration

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 7

Therefore, there are a total of [7] 3-stars in the given graph.
