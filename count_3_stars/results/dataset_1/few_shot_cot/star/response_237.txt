Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 5, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Unique 3-stars:
    - <0, (1, 2, 5)>
    - <0, (1, 2, 8)>
    - <0, (1, 5, 8)>
    - <0, (2, 5, 8)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Unique 3-stars:
    - <1, (0, 3, 6)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Unique 3-stars:
    - <3, (1, 4, 5)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Unique 3-stars:
    - <4, (3, 5, 6)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 4, 6, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - Unique 3-stars:
    - <5, (0, 3, 4)>
    - <5, (0, 3, 6)>
    - <5, (0, 4, 6)>
    - <5, (3, 4, 6)>
    - <5, (3, 4, 8)>
    - <5, (3, 6, 8)>
    - <5, (4, 6, 8)>
    - <5, (4, 6, 0)>
    - <5, (4, 6, 5)>
    - <5, (6, 8, 0)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 5, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Unique 3-stars:
    - <6, (1, 4, 5)>
    - <6, (1, 4, 8)>
    - <6, (1, 5, 8)>
    - <6, (4, 5, 8)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 5, 6, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Unique 3-stars:
    - <8, (0, 5, 6)>
    - <8, (0, 5, 7)>
    - <8, (0, 6, 7)>
    - <8, (5, 6, 7)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Adding all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 8: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 25

Therefore, there are a total of [25] 3-stars in your graph.
