Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {3, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <2, (1, 4, 9)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 5, 6, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <3, (0, 5, 6)>, <3, (0, 5, 7)>, <3, (0, 6, 9)>, <3, (5, 6, 9)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {3, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {3} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <9, (2, 3, 8)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6

Therefore, there are a total of [6] 3-stars in your graph.
