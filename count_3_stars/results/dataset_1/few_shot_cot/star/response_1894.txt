Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 0) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 7
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {9} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 4, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 = 5

Therefore, there are a total of [5] 3-stars in your graph.</br>
