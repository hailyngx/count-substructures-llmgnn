Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 3

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <1, (4, 5, 8)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <2, (0, 4, 8)>, <2, (0, 8, 9)>, <2, (4, 8, 9)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 5, 7, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - <3, (0, 4, 7)>, <3, (0, 5, 7)>, <3, (0, 4, 9)>, <3, (4, 5, 7)>, <3, (4, 5, 9)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
  - <4, (1, 3, 7)>, <4, (1, 3, 5)>, <4, (1, 5, 7)>, <4, (1, 3, 8)>, <4, (1, 7, 8)>, <4, (3, 5, 7)>, <4, (3, 5, 9)>, <4, (3, 7, 8)>, <4, (3, 7, 9)>, <4, (5, 7, 8)>, <4, (5, 7, 9)>, <4, (7, 8, 9)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <5, (1, 3, 7)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <7, (3, 4, 5)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <8, (1, 4, 2)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {2, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 4: 20
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 1

Therefore, there are a total of [38] 3-stars in your graph.
