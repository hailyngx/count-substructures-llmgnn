Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 3

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: No neighbors. Cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {6} (1 neighbor). Cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3, 6} (2 neighbors). Cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9} (6 neighbors).
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
  - Unique 3-stars:
    - <3, (2, 4, 5)>
    - <3, (2, 5, 7)>
    - <3, (2, 7, 8)>
    - <3, (4, 5, 7)>
    - <3, (4, 7, 8)>
    - <3, (5, 7, 8)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {3, 8} (2 neighbors). Cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {3} (1 neighbor). Cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 7} (3 neighbors).
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-stars:
    - <6, (1, 2, 7)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {3, 6} (2 neighbors). Cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {3, 4} (2 neighbors). Cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {3} (1 neighbor). Cannot form a 3-star.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 3: 20
- From Node 6: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 1 = 21
Therefore, there are a total of [21] 3-stars in your graph.
