Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 7, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <2, (3, 5, 7)>, <2, (3, 5, 9)>, <2, (3, 7, 9)>, <2, (5, 7, 9)>
  
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 7, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <3, (2, 7, 8)>, <3, (4, 7, 8)>, <3, (2, 4, 8)>, <3, (2, 4, 7)>
  
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {3} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <5, (1, 2, 9)>
  
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <7, (0, 2, 3)>
  
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {3, 6, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <8, (3, 6, 9)>
  
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <9, (2, 5, 8)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 12

Therefore, there are a total of [12] 3-stars in your graph.
