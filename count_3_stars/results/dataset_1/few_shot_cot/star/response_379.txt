Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {6, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-star: <3, (4, 5, 8)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 7, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-star: <4, (3, 5, 9)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {3, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 7, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-star: <6, (1, 7, 8)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 6, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-star: <7, (4, 6, 8)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 6, 7, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - Unique 3-star: <8, (3, 6, 9)> 
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 4, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-star: <9, (3, 4, 8)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6

Therefore, there are a total of [6] 3-stars in your graph.
