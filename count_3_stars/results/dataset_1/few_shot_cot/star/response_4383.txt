Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 9

Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 5

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {6, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - Unique 3-stars: <0, (6, 8, 9)>
  
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 4, 5, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
  - Unique 3-stars: <1, (2, 3, 4)>, <1, (2, 3, 5)>, <1, (2, 4, 5)>, <1, (3, 4, 5)>, <1, (3, 4, 7)>

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - Unique 3-stars: <2, (1, 4, 9)>

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 6, 7, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - Unique 3-stars: <3, (1, 6, 7)>, <3, (1, 6, 8)>, <3, (1, 7, 8)>, <3, (6, 7, 8)>

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 2} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 6, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - Unique 3-stars: <5, (1, 6, 9)>

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 5, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - Unique 3-stars: <6, (0, 3, 5)>, <6, (0, 3, 8)>, <6, (0, 5, 8)>, <6, (3, 5, 8)>

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - Unique 3-stars: <7, (1, 3, 8)>

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 6, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - Unique 3-stars: <8, (0, 3, 6)>, <8, (0, 3, 7)>, <8, (0, 6, 7)>, <8, (3, 6, 7)>

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - Unique 3-stars: <9, (0, 2, 5)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 27

Therefore, there are a total of [27] 3-stars in your graph.
