Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 1

Response:
Given the graph information provided, we will now calculate the number of 3-stars in the graph.

### Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Let's analyze each node based on the provided adjacency list:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 6, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <1, (0, 4, 6)>, <1, (0, 6, 9)>, <1, (4, 6, 9)>, <1, (0, 4, 9)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2, 6, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <3, (2, 6, 7)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {6} (1 neighbor)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 3, 5, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - <6, (0, 1, 3)>, <6, (0, 1, 7)>, <6, (0, 3, 7)>, <6, (1, 3, 7)>, <6, (0, 5, 7)>, <6, (1, 5, 7)>, <6, (3, 5, 7)>, <6, (0, 3, 5)>, <6, (1, 3, 5)>, <6, (0, 1, 5)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 4, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <7, (2, 3, 4)>, <7, (2, 3, 6)>, <7, (2, 4, 6)>, <7, (3, 4, 6)>
- **Node 8**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

### Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Adding up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 7: 4

### Final Answer
Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 19

Therefore, there are a total of [19] 3-stars in your graph.
