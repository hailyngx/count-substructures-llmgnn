Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 5

Response:
Calculation of 3-Star Configurations for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {9} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {9} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {7, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {2, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 5, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 8

Therefore, there are a total of [8] 3-stars in your graph.
