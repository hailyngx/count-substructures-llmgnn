Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {3, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - 3-Stars: <1, (2, 8, 9)>, <1, (3, 8, 9)>, <1, (2, 3, 9)>, <1, (2, 3, 8)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 5, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - 3-Stars: <2, (1, 5, 6)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - 3-Stars: <3, (1, 8, 9)>, <3, (0, 8, 9)>, <3, (0, 1, 9)>, <3, (0, 1, 8)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 7, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - 3-Stars: <5, (0, 7, 8)>, <5, (2, 7, 8)>, <5, (0, 2, 8)>, <5, (0, 2, 7)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - 3-Stars: <7, (4, 8, 9)>, <7, (5, 8, 9)>, <7, (4, 5, 9)>, <7, (4, 5, 8)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 5, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - 3-Stars: <8, (1, 5, 7)>, <8, (1, 3, 7)>, <8, (1, 5, 3)>, <8, (5, 3, 7)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - 3-Stars: <9, (1, 3, 7)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 22

Therefore, there are a total of [22] 3-stars in your graph.
