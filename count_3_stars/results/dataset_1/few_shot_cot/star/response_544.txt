Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 4

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: No neighbors
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {9} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 5} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - Unique 3-star: <2, (3, 4, 5)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2, 6, 8} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - Unique 3-star: <3, (2, 6, 8)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {2, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - Unique 3-star: <4, (2, 8, 9)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2, 6} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 8} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - Unique 3-star: <6, (3, 5, 8)>
- **Node 7**: No neighbors
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 6} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - Unique 3-star: <8, (3, 4, 6)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 4} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 2: <2, (3, 4, 5)>
- From Node 3: <3, (2, 6, 8)>
- From Node 4: <4, (2, 8, 9)>
- From Node 6: <6, (3, 5, 8)>
- From Node 8: <8, (3, 4, 6)>

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5

Therefore, there are a total of [5] 3-stars in your graph.
