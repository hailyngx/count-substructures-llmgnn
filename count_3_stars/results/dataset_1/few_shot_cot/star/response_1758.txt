Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 3

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 6, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Possible 3-star: <1, (3, 6, 9)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 6, 7, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - Possible 3-stars: <3, (1, 2, 6)>, <3, (1, 6, 9)>, <3, (2, 6, 7)>, <3, (2, 6, 9)>, <3, (6, 7, 9)>
- **Node 4**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 6, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Possible 3-stars: <5, (0, 2, 6)>, <5, (0, 2, 8)>, <5, (2, 6, 8)>, <5, (6, 8, 0)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Possible 3-star: <6, (1, 3, 5)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {3} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 1
Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 16

Therefore, there are a total of [16] 3-stars in your graph.
