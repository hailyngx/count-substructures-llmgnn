Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 3

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 6, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {3} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 1
Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 8
Therefore, there are a total of [8] 3-stars in your graph.
