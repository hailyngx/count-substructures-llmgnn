Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 20
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 8: 20

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 20 = 60

Therefore, there are a total of [60] 3-stars in your graph.
