Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 4

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will apply the combinatorial calculation \( \binom{n}{3} \) to each node with three or more neighbors. If a node has exactly three neighbors, it forms one 3-star with those neighbors. No 3-star is formed if a node has less than three neighbors.

Calculating the 3-stars for each node:
- **Node 0**: No neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 2} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {3} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 5: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 = 2

Therefore, there are a total of [2] 3-stars in the provided graph.
