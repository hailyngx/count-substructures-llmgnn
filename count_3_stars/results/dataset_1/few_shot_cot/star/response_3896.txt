Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 6

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-star: <1, (0, 2, 3)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
  - 3-stars: <2, (1, 6, 9)>, <2, (1, 6, 7)>, <2, (1, 7, 3)>, <2, (1, 7, 8)>, <2, (1, 8, 3)>, <2, (6, 3, 7)>, <2, (6, 3, 8)>, <2, (6, 7, 8)>, <2, (6, 7, 9)>, <2, (6, 8, 3)>, <2, (6, 8, 9)>, <2, (6, 9, 3)>, <2, (7, 3, 8)>, <2, (7, 3, 9)>, <2, (7, 8, 9)>, <2, (7, 9, 3)>, <2, (8, 3, 9)>, <2, (8, 9, 3)>, <2, (9, 3, 6)>, <2, (9, 6, 7)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 6, 7, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-stars: <3, (1, 6, 7)>, <3, (1, 6, 8)>, <3, (1, 7, 8)>, <3, (6, 7, 8)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {6} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 4, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-stars: <6, (2, 3, 9)>, <6, (2, 3, 7)>, <6, (2, 7, 9)>, <6, (3, 7, 8)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {2, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 20
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 6: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 20 + 4 + 4 = 29

Therefore, there are a total of [29] 3-stars in your graph.
