Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 7) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 5) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 1

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 7} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 9} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 7, 8} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 6**: No neighbors
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2, 3, 5} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 7: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 10 = 12

Therefore, there are a total of [12] 3-stars in your graph.
