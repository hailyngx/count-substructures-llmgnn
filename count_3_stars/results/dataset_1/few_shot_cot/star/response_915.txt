Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 3, 6, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 7, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2, 3, 6} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
- From Node 0: 20
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 8: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 44

Therefore, there are a total of [44] 3-stars in your graph.
