Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, 7, and node 8

Response:
Given the adjacency list provided, we can find the number of 3-stars in the graph by examining each node that has three or more neighbors. We will apply the combinatorial calculation \( \binom{n}{3} \) to find the number of 3-star configurations for each eligible node.

Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 6, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 4, 5} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 9} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3, 7, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 6, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {9} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 5, 7, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Adding up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 20
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 9: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 20 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10  
Therefore, there are a total of [51] 3-stars in your graph.
