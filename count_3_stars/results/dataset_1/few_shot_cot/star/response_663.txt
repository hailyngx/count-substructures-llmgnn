Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 5

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 5, 8, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(C(5, 3) = 10\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 4, 7, 8, 9} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(C(6, 3) = 20\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {6} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 6, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(C(4, 3) = 4\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 6, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(C(3, 3) = 1\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 5, 7, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(C(5, 3) = 10\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(C(3, 3) = 1\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(C(3, 3) = 1\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(C(3, 3) = 1\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Adding up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 1: 20
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 20 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 48

Therefore, there are a total of [48] 3-stars in your graph.
