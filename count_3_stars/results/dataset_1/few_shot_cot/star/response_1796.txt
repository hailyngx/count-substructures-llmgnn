Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <1, (2, 3, 6)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 3, 7, 8, 9} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
  - <2, (0, 1, 3)>, <2, (0, 1, 7)>, <2, (0, 1, 8)>, <2, (0, 1, 9)>, <2, (1, 3, 7)>, <2, (1, 3, 8)>, <2, (1, 3, 9)>, <2, (1, 7, 8)>, <2, (1, 7, 9)>, <2, (1, 8, 9)>, <2, (3, 7, 8)>, <2, (3, 7, 9)>, <2, (3, 8, 9)>, <2, (7, 8, 9)>, <2, (0, 1, 3)>, <2, (0, 3, 7)>, <2, (0, 3, 8)>, <2, (0, 3, 9)>, <2, (1, 7, 8)>, <2, (1, 7, 9)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 2} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 5, 6, 8, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - <4, (0, 5, 6)>, <4, (0, 5, 8)>, <4, (0, 5, 9)>, <4, (5, 6, 8)>, <4, (5, 6, 9)>, <4, (5, 8, 9)>, <4, (6, 8, 9)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <5, (4, 7, 8)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <6, (1, 4, 9)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <7, (2, 5, 9)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 5, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <8, (2, 4, 5)>, <8, (2, 4, 9)>, <8, (2, 5, 9)>, <8, (4, 5, 9)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 6, 7, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - <9, (2, 4, 6)>, <9, (2, 4, 7)>, <9, (2, 4, 8)>, <9, (2, 6, 7)>, <9, (2, 6, 8)>, <9, (2, 7, 8)>, <9, (4, 6, 7)>, <9, (4, 6, 8)>, <9, (4, 7, 8)>, <9, (6, 7, 8)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 20
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 20 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 48

Therefore, there are a total of [48] 3-stars in your graph.
