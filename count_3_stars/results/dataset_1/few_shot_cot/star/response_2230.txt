Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 5

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 4, 5, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
    - 3-Stars: <2, (0, 4, 5)>, <2, (0, 4, 8)>, <2, (0, 5, 8)>, <2, (4, 5, 8)>, <2, (3, 5, 8)>, <2, (4, 5, 9)>, <2, (5, 8, 9)>, <2, (0, 8, 9)>, <2, (3, 8, 9)>, <2, (0, 3, 9)>

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\>

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 2} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\>

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 7**: Not connected to any node.

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 5, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\>
    - 3-Stars: <8, (2, 3, 5)>, <8, (2, 3, 6)>, <8, (2, 5, 6)>, <8, (3, 5, 6)>

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {3, 5} (2 neighbors)
  -  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 8: 4
Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 17

Therefore, there are a total of [17] 3-stars in your graph.
