Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 8} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9} (6 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
    - <4, (1, 5, 6)>, <4, (1, 5, 7)>, <4, (1, 5, 8)>, <4, (1, 5, 9)>, <4, (1, 6, 7)>, <4, (1, 6, 8)>, <4, (1, 6, 9)>, <4, (1, 7, 8)>, <4, (1, 7, 9)>, <4, (1, 8, 9)>, <4, (5, 6, 7)>, <4, (5, 6, 8)>, <4, (5, 6, 9)>, <4, (5, 7, 8)>, <4, (5, 7, 9)>, <4, (5, 8, 9)>, <4, (6, 7, 8)>, <4, (6, 7, 9)>, <4, (6, 8, 9)>, <4, (7, 8, 9)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 6, 8, 9} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    - <5, (0, 4, 6)>, <5, (0, 4, 8)>, <5, (0, 4, 9)>, <5, (4, 6, 8)>, <5, (4, 6, 9)>, <5, (4, 8, 9)>, <5, (6, 8, 9)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 9} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
    - <7, (2, 4, 9)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 4, 5, 6} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    - <8, (1, 3, 4)>, <8, (1, 3, 5)>, <8, (1, 3, 6)>, <8, (1, 4, 5)>, <8, (1, 4, 6)>, <8, (1, 5, 6)>, <8, (3, 4, 5)>, <8, (3, 4, 6)>, <8, (3, 5, 6)>, <8, (4, 5, 6)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 6, 7} (4 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 4: 20
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 10 + 1 + 10 = 41

Therefore, there are a total of [41] 3-stars in your graph.
