Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 5
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 6

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Not connected to any other nodes.
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Not connected to any other nodes.
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {3, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 6, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 8**: Not connected to any other nodes.
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {6} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4

Therefore, there are a total of [4] 3-stars in your graph.
