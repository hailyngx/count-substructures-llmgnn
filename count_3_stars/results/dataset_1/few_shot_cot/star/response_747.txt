Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 9) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 4

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Unique 3-star: <1, (0, 3, 8)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {6, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: No neighbors.
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Unique 3-star: <7, (2, 4, 8)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Unique 3-star: <8, (0, 1, 7)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {3, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 1: 1 3-star
- From Node 7: 1 3-star
- From Node 8: 1 3-star
Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3

Therefore, there are a total of [3] 3-stars in your graph.
