Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, and node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {7, 8} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 4} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 6, 7, 8} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - Unique 3-stars: <2, (1, 6, 7)>, <2, (1, 6, 8)>, <2, (1, 7, 8)>, <2, (6, 7, 8)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 6} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 6} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {3, 7, 9} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - Unique 3-star: <5, (3, 7, 9)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 4} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - Unique 3-star: <6, (2, 3, 4)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 5, 8, 9} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
    - Unique 3-stars: <7, (0, 2, 5)>, <7, (0, 2, 8)>, <7, (0, 5, 8)>, <7, (2, 5, 8)>, <7, (5, 8, 9)>, <7, (2, 5, 9)>, <7, (0, 5, 9)>, <7, (0, 8, 9)>, <7, (2, 8, 9)>, <7, (0, 2, 9)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 7} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - Unique 3-star: <8, (0, 2, 7)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 7} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 17

Therefore, there are a total of [17] 3-stars in your graph.
