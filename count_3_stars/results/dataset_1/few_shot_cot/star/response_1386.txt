Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 6) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 5, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9} (7 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{7}{3}\) = 35
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {6, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {6} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 6: 35

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 35 = 41

Therefore, there are a total of [41] 3-stars in your graph.
