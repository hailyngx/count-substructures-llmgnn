Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 7, 8, and node 9

Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 3

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 2} (2 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
  - <1, (0, 4, 8)>, <1, (0, 4, 9)>, <1, (0, 8, 9)>, <1, (4, 8, 9)>, <1, (3, 4, 8)>, <1, (3, 4, 9)>, <1, (3, 8, 9)>, <1, (4, 8, 9)>, <1, (7, 8, 9)>, <1, (3, 7, 8)> ... (Total 20 configurations)
  
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <2, (0, 3, 6)>
  
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 5, 7, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - <3, (1, 2, 7)>, <3, (1, 5, 7)>, <3, (1, 7, 9)>, <3, (2, 5, 7)>, <3, (2, 7, 9)> ... (Total 10 configurations)
  
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {3, 6, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <5, (3, 6, 7)>
  
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <6, (2, 5, 7)>
  
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 5, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <7, (1, 5, 6)>, <7, (1, 5, 7)>, <7, (1, 6, 7)>, <7, (5, 6, 7)>
  
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 20
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 37

Therefore, there are a total of [37] 3-stars in your graph.
