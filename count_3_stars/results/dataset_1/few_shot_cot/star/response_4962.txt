Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 4, 8} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - 3-star configurations: <0, (1, 3, 4)>, <0, (1, 3, 8)>, <0, (1, 4, 8)>, <0, (3, 4, 8)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 3} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - 3-star configurations: <2, (4, 5, 8)>, <2, (4, 5, 9)>, <2, (4, 8, 9)>, <2, (5, 8, 9)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 9} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - 3-star configuration: <3, (0, 1, 9)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 2} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2, 6} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 8} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - 3-star configuration: <6, (5, 7, 8)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {6, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - 3-star configuration: <7, (6, 8, 9)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 6, 7} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - 3-star configurations: <8, (0, 2, 6)>, <8, (0, 2, 7)>, <8, (0, 6, 7)>, <8, (2, 6, 7)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 7} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - 3-star configuration: <9, (2, 3, 7)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 16

Therefore, there are a total of [16] 3-stars in your graph.
