Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 4

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-star: <0, (2, 4, 5)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-star: <2, (0, 4, 5)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 7, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-stars: <3, (1, 4, 7)>, <3, (1, 4, 9)>, <3, (4, 7, 9)>, <3, (1, 7, 9)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 3, 8, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - 3-stars: <4, (0, 2, 9)>, <4, (0, 3, 9)>, <4, (2, 3, 8)>, <4, (0, 3, 8)>, <4, (2, 8, 9)>, <4, (0, 8, 9)>, <4, (3, 8, 9)>, <4, (0, 2, 4)>, <4, (2, 4, 9)>, <4, (0, 4, 9)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-star: <5, (0, 2, 7)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {7, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-star: <7, (3, 5, 6)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {3, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Total number of unique 3-stars = 1 (from Node 0) + 1 (from Node 2) + 4 (from Node 3) + 10 (from Node 4) + 1 (from Node 5) + 1 (from Node 7) = 18

Therefore, there are a total of [18] 3-stars in your graph.
