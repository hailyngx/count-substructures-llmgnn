Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 7, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - 3-star: <1, (2, 7, 8)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 4, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - 3-stars: <2, (1, 3, 4)>, <2, (1, 4, 8)>, <2, (3, 4, 8)>, <2, (1, 3, 8)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - 3-star: <4, (0, 2, 7)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {6, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 5, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - 3-star: <6, (0, 5, 7)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - 3-star: <7, (1, 4, 6)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 2} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 7

Therefore, there are a total of [7] 3-stars in your graph.
