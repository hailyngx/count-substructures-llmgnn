Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - 3-star configurations: <0, (1, 4, 9)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 7, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - 3-star configurations: <4, (0, 7, 9)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {7, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {8, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - 3-star configurations: <7, (2, 4, 5)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {3, 6, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - 3-star configurations: <8, (3, 6, 9)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 8} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3}\) = 20
  - 3-star configurations: <9, (0, 4, 6)>, <9, (0, 4, 8)>, <9, (0, 5, 8)>, <9, (1, 4, 6)>, <9, (1, 4, 8)>, <9, (1, 5, 8)>, <9, (4, 5, 6)>, <9, (4, 5, 8)>, <9, (4, 6, 8)>, <9, (5, 6, 8)>, <9, (0, 6, 8)>, <9, (0, 4, 5)>, <9, (0, 5, 6)>, <9, (0, 6, 9)>, <9, (4, 6, 9)>, <9, (1, 6, 8)>, <9, (1, 4, 5)>, <9, (1, 5, 6)>, <9, (1, 6, 9)>, <9, (5, 6, 9)>
  
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 20 = 24

Therefore, there are a total of [24] 3-stars in your graph.
