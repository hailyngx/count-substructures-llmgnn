Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {8, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {6, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 6, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-star: <4, (1, 6, 8)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {3, 6, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <5, (3, 6, 8)>, <5, (3, 6, 9)>, <5, (3, 8, 9)>, <5, (6, 8, 9)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-star: <6, (2, 4, 5)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-star: <7, (1, 8, 9)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{6}{3} = 20\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <8, (0, 3, 4)>, <8, (0, 3, 5)>, <8, (0, 3, 7)>, <8, (0, 3, 9)>, <8, (0, 4, 5)>, <8, (0, 4, 7)>, <8, (0, 4, 9)>, <8, (0, 5, 7)>, <8, (0, 5, 9)>, <8, (0, 7, 9)>, <8, (3, 4, 5)>, <8, (3, 4, 7)>, <8, (3, 4, 9)>, <8, (3, 5, 7)>, <8, (3, 5, 9)>, <8, (3, 7, 9)>, <8, (4, 5, 7)>, <8, (4, 5, 9)>, <8, (4, 7, 9)>, <8, (5, 7, 9)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 5, 7, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <9, (0, 5, 7)>, <9, (0, 5, 8)>, <9, (0, 7, 8)>, <9, (2, 5, 7)>, <9, (2, 5, 8)>, <9, (2, 7, 8)>, <9, (5, 7, 8)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 20
- From Node 9: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 20 + 10 = 37

Therefore, there are a total of [37] 3-stars in your graph.
