Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, and node 6

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 7, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - <4, (0, 7, 8)>, <4, (2, 7, 8)>, <4, (7, 8, 0)>, <4, (7, 8, 2)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - <5, (2, 8, 9)>, <5, (3, 8, 9)>, <5, (8, 9, 2)>, <5, (8, 9, 3)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - <7, (3, 4, 8)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - <8, (4, 5, 7)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 10
Therefore, there are a total of [10] 3-stars in your graph.
