Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 6, 7, 9} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - <0, (1, 6, 7)>, <0, (1, 6, 9)>, <0, (1, 7, 9)>, <0, (6, 7, 9)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 5, 7, 8} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - <1, (0, 5, 7)>, <1, (0, 5, 8)>, <1, (0, 7, 8)>, <1, (5, 7, 8)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {7, 8} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 7, 8} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - <4, (5, 6, 7)>, <4, (5, 6, 8)>, <4, (5, 7, 8)>, <4, (6, 7, 8)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 6, 7} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - <5, (1, 6, 7)>, <5, (1, 6, 4)>, <5, (1, 7, 4)>, <5, (6, 7, 4)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 5} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - <6, (0, 4, 5)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 3, 4, 5} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
    - <7, (0, 1, 4)>, <7, (0, 1, 5)>, <7, (0, 4, 5)>, <7, (1, 4, 5)>, <7, (0, 1, 3)>, <7, (0, 1, 7)>, <7, (0, 3, 7)>, <7, (0, 4, 7)>, <7, (0, 5, 7)>, <7, (1, 4, 7)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3, 4} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - <8, (1, 2, 3)>, <8, (1, 2, 4)>, <8, (1, 3, 4)>, <8, (2, 3, 4)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
    
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 31

Therefore, there are a total of [31] 3-stars in your graph.
