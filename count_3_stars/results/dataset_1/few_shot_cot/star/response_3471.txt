Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 9
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 5, and node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {6, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 9} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {9} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: No neighbors
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 7} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 7} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2, 5, 7} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 9: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 10 = 12
Therefore, there are a total of [12] 3-stars in your graph.
