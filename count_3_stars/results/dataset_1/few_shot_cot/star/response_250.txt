Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 5, 7, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <0, (1, 5, 7)>, <0, (1, 5, 9)>, <0, (5, 7, 9)>, <0, (1, 7, 9)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 5, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <1, (0, 5, 9)>
- **Node 2**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {8, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <4, (5, 7, 8)>, <4, (5, 7, 9)>, <4, (5, 8, 9)>, <4, (7, 8, 9)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 4, 6, 7, 9} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <5, (0, 1, 9)>, <5, (0, 4, 9)>, <5, (0, 6, 9)>, <5, (0, 7, 9)>, <5, (1, 4, 9)>, <5, (1, 7, 9)>, <5, (4, 6, 9)>, <5, (4, 7, 9)>, <5, (6, 7, 9)>, <5, (0, 1, 4)>, <5, (0, 1, 7)>, <5, (0, 4, 7)>, <5, (1, 4, 7)>, <5, (0, 6, 7)>, <5, (4, 6, 7)>, <5, (0, 1, 5)>, <5, (0, 5, 6)>, <5, (1, 4, 5)>, <5, (4, 6, 5)>, <5, (6, 7, 9)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-star: <6, (5, 7, 9)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 5, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <7, (0, 4, 5)>, <7, (0, 5, 6)>, <7, (4, 5, 6)>, <7, (0, 4, 6)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {3, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <9, (0, 1, 5)>, <9, (0, 1, 6)>, <9, (0, 1, 9)>, <9, (0, 4, 5)>, <9, (0, 5, 6)>, <9, (0, 5, 9)>, <9, (0, 6, 9)>, <9, (1, 4, 5)>, <9, (1, 5, 6)>, <9, (1, 5, 9)>, <9, (1, 6, 9)>, <9, (4, 5, 6)>, <9, (4, 5, 9)>, <9, (4, 6, 9)>, <9, (5, 6, 9)>, <9, (0, 1, 4)>, <9, (0, 4, 6)>, <9, (1, 5, 7)>, <9, (4, 5, 7)>, <9, (5, 6, 7)>
  
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 20
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 9: 20

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 20 + 1 + 4 + 20 = 54

Therefore, there are a total of [54] 3-stars in your graph.
