Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 7) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 9
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, and node 7

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will follow the same approach as in the example provided. We will calculate the number of 3-star configurations for each node that has three or more neighbors. 

Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: No neighbors
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 7} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {6} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 9} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {3, 9} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 9} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Unique 3-star: <7, (1, 2, 9)>

- **Node 8**: No neighbors
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 6, 7} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <9, (4, 5, 6)>, <9, (4, 5, 7)>, <9, (4, 6, 7)>, <9, (5, 6, 7)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 = 5

Therefore, there are a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
