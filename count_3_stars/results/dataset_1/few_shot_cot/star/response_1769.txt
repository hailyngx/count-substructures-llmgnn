Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 4, 5, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <1, (0, 2, 4)>, <1, (0, 2, 5)>, <1, (0, 2, 8)>, <1, (0, 4, 5)>, <1, (0, 4, 8)>, <1, (0, 5, 8)>, <1, (2, 4, 5)>, <1, (2, 4, 8)>, <1, (2, 5, 8)>, <1, (4, 5, 8)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 4, 5, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <2, (1, 3, 4)>, <2, (1, 3, 5)>, <2, (1, 3, 7)>, <2, (1, 4, 5)>, <2, (1, 4, 7)>, <2, (1, 5, 7)>, <2, (3, 4, 5)>, <2, (3, 4, 7)>, <2, (3, 5, 7)>, <2, (4, 5, 7)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 2} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-star: <5, (1, 2, 8)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {3} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Adding up the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 5: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 1 = 21

Therefore, there are a total of [21] 3-stars in your graph.
