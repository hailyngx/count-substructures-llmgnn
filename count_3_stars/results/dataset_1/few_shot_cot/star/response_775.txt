Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 5
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <1, (2, 5, 9)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <2, (1, 4, 5)>
- **Node 3**: Not connected to any node.
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 5, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <4, (0, 2, 5)>, <4, (0, 5, 7)>, <4, (2, 5, 7)>, <4, (0, 2, 7)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 4, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <5, (1, 2, 4)>, <5, (1, 4, 6)>, <5, (2, 4, 6)>, <5, (1, 2, 6)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {9} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <9, (0, 1, 8)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 11

Therefore, there are a total of [11] 3-stars in your graph.
This count represents how many unique 3-star subgraphs can be formed based on the adjacency list provided.
