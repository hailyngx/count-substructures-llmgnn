Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 6

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {3, 9} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 8} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 8} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 6, 9} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 4, 6} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 5, 9} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 7**: No neighbors
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 2} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 6} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 15

Therefore, there are a total of [15] 3-stars in your graph.
