Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 5, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 2} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 6**: Not connected to any other nodes.
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 7, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 20
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 20 + 1 + 4 = 26

Therefore, there are a total of [26] 3-stars in your graph.
