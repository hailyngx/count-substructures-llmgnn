Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 4, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 
  - <0, (1, 3, 4)> 
  - <0, (1, 3, 8)> 
  - <0, (1, 4, 8)> 
  - <0, (3, 4, 8)> 

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 
  - <2, (5, 6, 8)> 

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 
  - <3, (0, 4, 8)> 

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 6, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 
  - <4, (0, 3, 6)> 
  - <4, (0, 3, 7)> 
  - <4, (0, 6, 7)> 
  - <4, (3, 6, 7)> 

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 
  - <5, (2, 8, 9)> 

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 
  - <6, (2, 4, 8)> 

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 3, 5, 6} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 
  - <8, (0, 3, 5)> 
  - <8, (0, 3, 6)> 
  - <8, (0, 5, 6)> 
  - <8, (3, 5, 6)> 
  - <8, (0, 3, 2)> 
  - <8, (3, 2, 5)> 
  - <8, (0, 2, 5)> 
  - <8, (0, 2, 6)> 
  - <8, (2, 5, 6)> 
  - <8, (3, 5, 6)> 

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 23

Therefore, there are a total of [23] 3-stars in your graph.
