Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 2

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 4, 7} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - 3-Stars: <0, (2, 3, 4)>, <0, (2, 3, 7)>, <0, (2, 4, 7)>, <0, (3, 4, 7)>
  
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {9} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 4, 5, 9} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
    - 3-Stars: <2, (0, 3, 4)>, <2, (0, 3, 5)>, <2, (0, 4, 5)>, <2, (3, 4, 5)>, <2, (0, 4, 9)>, <2, (3, 4, 9)>, <2, (0, 5, 9)>, <2, (3, 5, 9)>, <2, (4, 5, 9)>, <2, (0, 3, 9)>
  
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 5} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - 3-Star: <3, (0, 2, 5)>
  
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 7, 8} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - 3-Stars: <4, (0, 2, 7)>, <4, (0, 2, 8)>, <4, (0, 7, 8)>, <4, (2, 7, 8)>
  
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2, 3} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 6**: Not connected to any node.
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
  
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 4} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 2} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 0: <0, (2, 3, 4)>, <0, (2, 3, 7)>, <0, (2, 4, 7)>, <0, (3, 4, 7)> (4)
- From Node 2: <2, (0, 3, 4)>, <2, (0, 3, 5)>, <2, (0, 4, 5)>, <2, (3, 4, 5)>, <2, (0, 4, 9)>, <2, (3, 4, 9)>, <2, (0, 5, 9)>, <2, (3, 5, 9)>, <2, (4, 5, 9)>, <2, (0, 3, 9)> (10)
- From Node 3: <3, (0, 2, 5)> (1)
- From Node 4: <4, (0, 2, 7)>, <4, (0, 2, 8)>, <4, (0, 7, 8)>, <4, (2, 7, 8)> (4)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 = 19
Therefore, there are a total of [19] 3-stars in your graph.
