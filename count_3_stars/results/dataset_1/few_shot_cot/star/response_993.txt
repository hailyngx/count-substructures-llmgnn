Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 8) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 5

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list provided, we'll analyze each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 5, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 4, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {6} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 4, 5} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 14

Therefore, there are a total of [14] 3-stars in your graph.
