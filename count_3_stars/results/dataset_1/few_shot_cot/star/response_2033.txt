Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: No neighbors. Cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {8, 9} (2 neighbors). Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 5, 7} (4 neighbors).
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-star configurations: <2, (3, 4, 5)>, <2, (3, 5, 7)>, <2, (4, 5, 7)>, <2, (3, 4, 7)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2, 7} (2 neighbors). Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {2, 9} (2 neighbors). Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2, 8} (2 neighbors). Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: No neighbors. Cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 9} (3 neighbors).
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-star configurations: <7, (2, 3, 9)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 5} (2 neighbors). Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 7} (3 neighbors).
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-star configurations: <9, (1, 4, 7)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 2: 4 configurations
- From Node 7: 1 configuration
- From Node 9: 1 configuration
Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6

Therefore, there are a total of [6] 3-stars in your graph.
