Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (6, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Not connected to any other nodes.
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {3, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {8, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
There are no nodes with 3 or more neighbors, hence no 3-stars can be formed.

Therefore, there are a total of [0] 3-stars in your graph.
