Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 4
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 0

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 7, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 3, 7, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 5, 7, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Not connected to any nodes.
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 7: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 24

Therefore, there are a total of [24] 3-stars in your graph.
