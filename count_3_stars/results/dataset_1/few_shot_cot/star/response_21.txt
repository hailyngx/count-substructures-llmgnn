Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7)

Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 4, 6, and node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {7, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3, 7, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-star: <2, (3, 7, 8)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 5, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-stars: <3, (2, 4, 9)>, <3, (2, 5, 9)>, <3, (4, 5, 9)>, <3, (2, 4, 5)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-star: <4, (1, 3, 9)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {3} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {7, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 6, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-stars: <7, (0, 2, 9)>, <7, (0, 6, 9)>, <7, (2, 6, 9)>, <7, (0, 2, 6)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-star: <8, (0, 1, 2)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 6, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-stars: <9, (3, 4, 6)>, <9, (3, 7, 6)>, <9, (3, 4, 7)>, <9, (4, 7, 6)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 15

Therefore, there are a total of [15] 3-stars in your graph.
