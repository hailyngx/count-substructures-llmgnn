Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 6

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 5, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - <0, (1, 5, 9)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 3, 4, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
  - <1, (0, 2, 3)>, <1, (0, 2, 4)>, <1, (0, 3, 4)>, <1, (2, 3, 4)>, <1, (0, 3, 8)>, <1, (2, 3, 8)>, <1, (0, 4, 8)>, <1, (2, 4, 8)>, <1, (0, 2, 8)>, <1, (3, 4, 8)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - <2, (1, 3, 5)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - <3, (1, 2, 9)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 6, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - <5, (0, 2, 6)>, <5, (0, 2, 8)>, <5, (0, 6, 8)>, <5, (2, 6, 8)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - <6, (5, 7, 9)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {6} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - <8, (1, 4, 5)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - <9, (0, 3, 6)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 20

Therefore, there are a total of [20] 3-stars in your graph.
