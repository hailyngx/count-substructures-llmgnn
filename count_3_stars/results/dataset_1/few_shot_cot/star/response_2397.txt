Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5

Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - <0, (2, 5, 7)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - <1, (5, 7, 8)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 7, 8, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
  - <5, (0, 1, 7)>, <5, (0, 1, 8)>, <5, (0, 7, 8)>, <5, (1, 7, 8)>, <5, (0, 7, 9)>, <5, (1, 7, 9)>, <5, (7, 8, 9)>
- **Node 6**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 4, 5, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
  - <7, (0, 1, 5)>, <7, (0, 1, 8)>, <7, (0, 5, 8)>, <7, (1, 5, 8)>, <7, (0, 5, 9)>, <7, (1, 5, 9)>, <7, (5, 8, 9)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 5, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - <8, (1, 5, 7)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 1 = 23

Therefore, there are a total of [23] 3-stars in your graph.
