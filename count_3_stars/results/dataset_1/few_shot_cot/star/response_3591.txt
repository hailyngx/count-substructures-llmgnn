Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
  - Unique 3-star configurations: 
    - <0, (2, 4, 5)>
    - <0, (2, 4, 7)>
    - <0, (2, 4, 8)>
    - <0, (2, 4, 9)>
    - <0, (2, 5, 7)>
    - <0, (2, 5, 8)>
    - <0, (2, 5, 9)>
    - <0, (2, 7, 8)>
    - <0, (2, 7, 9)>
    - <0, (2, 8, 9)>
    - <0, (4, 5, 7)>
    - <0, (4, 5, 8)>
    - <0, (4, 5, 9)>
    - <0, (4, 7, 8)>
    - <0, (4, 7, 9)>
    - <0, (4, 8, 9)>
    - <0, (5, 7, 8)>
    - <0, (5, 7, 9)>
    - <0, (5, 8, 9)>
    - <0, (7, 8, 9)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {9} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 4, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Unique 3-star configuration: 
    - <2, (0, 4, 9)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Unique 3-star configuration: 
    - <3, (2, 5, 6)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 5, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Unique 3-star configurations: 
    - <4, (0, 2, 5)>
    - <4, (0, 2, 6)>
    - <4, (2, 5, 6)>
    - <4, (5, 6, 0)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Unique 3-star configuration: 
    - <5, (0, 3, 4)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Unique 3-star configuration: 
    - <6, (3, 4, 8)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Unique 3-star configurations: 
    - <9, (0, 1, 2)>
    - <9, (0, 1, 7)>
    - <9, (0, 2, 7)>
    - <9, (1, 2, 7)>
  
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 20
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 35

Therefore, there are a total of [35] 3-stars in your graph.
