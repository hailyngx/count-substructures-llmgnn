Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 5

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {8, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = None
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 3, 4, 5} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 20

Therefore, there are a total of [20] 3-stars in your graph.
