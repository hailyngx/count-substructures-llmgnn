Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 5

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 1**: Not enough neighbors to form a 3-star.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3, 7, 8} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
    - Not enough neighbors to form a 3-star.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor)
    - Not enough neighbors to form a 3-star.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 6, 9} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 7} (2 neighbors)
    - Not enough neighbors to form a 3-star.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 6} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 2} (2 neighbors)
    - Not enough neighbors to form a 3-star.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 5} (2 neighbors)
    - Not enough neighbors to form a 3-star.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 7: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4

Therefore, there are a total of [4] 3-stars in your graph.
