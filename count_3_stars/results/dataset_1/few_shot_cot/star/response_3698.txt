Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 7, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 1**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 3**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {9} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 2} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 2} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 7, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Adding up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 11
Therefore, there are a total of [11] 3-stars in your graph.
