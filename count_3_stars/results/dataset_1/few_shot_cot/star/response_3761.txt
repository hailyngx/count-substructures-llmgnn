Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 6

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {6} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {7, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 4**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 6, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 5, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {3} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 5, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 0: 0
- From Node 1: 0
- From Node 2: 0
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 0
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 0
- From Node 8: 0
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 4 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 4 = 10

Therefore, there are a total of [10] 3-stars in your graph.
