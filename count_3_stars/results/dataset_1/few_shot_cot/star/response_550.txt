Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 4, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 7, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 5, 6, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 6, 7, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 5, 6, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2, 4, 5} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 3, 8, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {7, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 7, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 50
Therefore, there are a total of [50] 3-stars in your graph.
