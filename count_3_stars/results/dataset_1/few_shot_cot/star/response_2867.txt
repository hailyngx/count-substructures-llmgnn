Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, 7, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 7, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \({4 \choose 3} = 4\)
  - <3, (4, 6, 7)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {3} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \({4 \choose 3} = 4\)
  - <7, (3, 5, 8)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {7, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 7, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \({4 \choose 3} = 4\)
  - <9, (2, 3, 7)>, <9, (3, 7, 8)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 9: 2
Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4

Therefore, there are a total of [4] 3-stars in your graph.
