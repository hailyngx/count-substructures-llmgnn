Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 8
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 8

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we'll follow the same process as described in the example:

Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
1. **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 8} (2 neighbors)
   - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

2. **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3, 4} (2 neighbors)
   - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

3. **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 8} (3 neighbors)
   - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
   - <3, (2, 5, 8)>

4. **Node 4**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
   - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

5. **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 3} (2 neighbors)
   - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

6. **Node 6**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
   - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

7. **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 6, 9} (4 neighbors)
   - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   - <8, (0, 3, 6)>, <8, (0, 3, 9)>, <8, (6, 3, 9)>, <8, (0, 6, 9)>

8. **Node 9**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
   - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 8: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 = 5

Therefore, there are a total of [5] 3-stars in your graph.
