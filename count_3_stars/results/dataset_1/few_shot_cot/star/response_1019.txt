Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 7, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 8, 9}(3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {3, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 6, 7, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {3, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 13
Therefore, there are a total of [13] 3-stars in your graph.
