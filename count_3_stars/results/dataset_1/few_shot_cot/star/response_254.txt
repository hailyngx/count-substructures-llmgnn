Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 5, 7, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {6, 7, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {7, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 9} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {6, 7, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 7, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 20
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 20 + 1 + 4 = 28

Therefore, there are a total of [28] 3-stars in your graph.
