Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 5, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-Stars: <0, (2, 3, 5)>, <0, (2, 3, 6)>, <0, (2, 5, 6)>, <0, (3, 5, 6)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-Stars: <1, (5, 6, 9)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 6, 7, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - 3-Stars: <3, (0, 4, 6)>, <3, (0, 4, 9)>, <3, (0, 6, 9)>, <3, (4, 6, 9)>, <3, (0, 6, 7)>, <3, (6, 7, 9)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {2, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 6, 8, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - 3-Stars: <5, (0, 1, 6)>, <5, (0, 1, 9)>, <5, (0, 6, 8)>, <5, (0, 8, 9)>, <5, (1, 6, 9)>, <5, (6, 8, 9)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 3, 5} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-Stars: <6, (0, 1, 3)>, <6, (0, 1, 5)>, <6, (0, 3, 5)>, <6, (1, 3, 5)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {3} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 5, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-Stars: <9, (1, 3, 5)>, <9, (1, 3, 8)>, <9, (1, 5, 8)>, <9, (3, 5, 8)>
  
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 33

Therefore, there are a total of [33] 3-stars in your graph.
