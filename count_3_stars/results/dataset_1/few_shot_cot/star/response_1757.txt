Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 6, and node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 5, 7, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 6, 7, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {4, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 5, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 4, 6, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10

Total number of 3-stars = 4 (from Node 0) + 10 (from Node 3) + 10 (from Node 4) + 1 (from Node 5) + 1 (from Node 6) + 1 (from Node 7) + 4 (from Node 8) + 10 (from Node 9) = 41

Therefore, there are a total of [41] 3-stars in your graph.
