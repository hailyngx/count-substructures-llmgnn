Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 5

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: No neighbors. Cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {6, 9} (2 neighbors). Cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 6} (2 neighbors). Cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 3**: No neighbors. Cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 7, 9} (4 neighbors).
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <4, (5, 6, 9)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 6, 8, 9} (5 neighbors).
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <5, (2, 4, 6)>, <5, (2, 6, 8)>, <5, (4, 6, 9)>, <5, (6, 8, 9)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8} (6 neighbors).
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <6, (1, 4, 9)>, <6, (2, 4, 5)>, <6, (2, 5, 8)>, <6, (2, 4, 9)>, <6, (5, 8, 9)>, <6, (4, 7, 9)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 6} (2 neighbors). Cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5, 6} (2 neighbors). Cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 5} (3 neighbors). Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 20
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 20 + 1 = 35

Therefore, there are a total of [35] 3-stars in your graph.
