Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 5, and node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {6, 9} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 6, 9} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - Unique 3-stars:
        - <1, (2, 6, 9)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 7, 9} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - Unique 3-stars:
        - <2, (1, 7, 9)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 7} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: No neighbors
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {3, 6, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - Unique 3-stars:
        - <5, (3, 6, 8)>, <5, (3, 6, 9)>, <5, (6, 8, 9)>, <5, (3, 8, 9)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 5} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - Unique 3-stars:
        - <6, (0, 1, 5)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 9} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - Unique 3-stars:
        - <7, (2, 3, 9)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2, 5, 7} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
    - Unique 3-stars:
        - <9, (0, 1, 2)>, <9, (0, 1, 5)>, <9, (0, 2, 5)>, <9, (1, 2, 5)>, <9, (0, 2, 7)>, <9, (1, 2, 7)>, <9, (0, 5, 7)>, <9, (1, 5, 7)>, <9, (2, 5, 7)>, <9, (1, 7, 2)>
    
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 9: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 18

Therefore, there are a total of [18] 3-stars in your graph.
