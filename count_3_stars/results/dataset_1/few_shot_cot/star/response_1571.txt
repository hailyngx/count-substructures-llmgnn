Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 6

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Possible 3-stars: <1, (0, 2, 8)>, <1, (0, 2, 9)>, <1, (0, 8, 9)>, <1, (2, 8, 9)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 4, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Possible 3-stars: <2, (1, 3, 4)>, <2, (1, 3, 9)>, <2, (1, 4, 9)>, <2, (3, 4, 9)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Possible 3-stars: <3, (2, 5, 8)>, <3, (2, 5, 9)>, <3, (2, 8, 9)>, <3, (5, 8, 9)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {2, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {3, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Possible 3-stars: <6, (5, 7, 8)>, <6, (5, 7, 9)>, <6, (5, 8, 9)>, <6, (7, 8, 9)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {6} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 4, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Possible 3-stars: <8, (1, 3, 4)>, <8, (1, 3, 6)>, <8, (1, 4, 6)>, <8, (3, 4, 6)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Possible 3-stars: <9, (1, 2, 3)>, <9, (1, 2, 6)>, <9, (1, 3, 6)>, <9, (2, 3, 6)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 24

Therefore, there are a total of [24] 3-stars in your graph.
