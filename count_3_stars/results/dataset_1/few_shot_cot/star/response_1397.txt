Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 7} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3, 8} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 2} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: No neighbors
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 5**: No neighbors
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 6**: No neighbors
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 8} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2, 7} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: No neighbors
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
- From Node 7: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1

Therefore, there are a total of [1] 3-star in your graph.
