Node 9 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list provided, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

- **Node 0**: No neighbors, cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 7} (2 neighbors), cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2, 5} (2 neighbors), cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {2, 9} (2 neighbors), cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {3, 7, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 6**: Neighbor = {9} (1 neighbor), cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 5, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {7, 9} (2 neighbors), cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 6, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Adding up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 7

Therefore, there are a total of [7] 3-stars in your graph.
