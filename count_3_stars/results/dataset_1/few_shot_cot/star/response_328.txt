Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 0

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 7, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - 3-Stars: <0, (4, 5, 7)>, <0, (4, 5, 9)>, <0, (4, 7, 9)>, <0, (5, 7, 9)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - 3-Star: <1, (2, 3, 7)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 5, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - 3-Stars: <3, (1, 4, 5)>, <3, (1, 4, 6)>, <3, (1, 5, 6)>, <3, (4, 5, 6)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbor = 3 (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 1} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbor = 2 (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbor = 0 (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 3: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 = 9

Therefore, there are a total of [9] 3-stars in your graph.
