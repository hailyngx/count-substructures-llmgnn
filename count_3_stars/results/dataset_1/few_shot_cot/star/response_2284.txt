Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 5

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {9} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <5, (0, 8, 9)>, <5, (0, 4, 9)>, <5, (4, 8, 9)>, <5, (0, 4, 8)>
- **Node 6**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {3, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 5: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4

Therefore, there are a total of [4] 3-stars in your graph.
