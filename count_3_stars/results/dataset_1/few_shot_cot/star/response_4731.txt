Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 4

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 7} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 7} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - <1, (5, 6, 7)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 9} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - <2, (0, 4, 9)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 6} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 6, 8, 9} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
    - <4, (2, 5, 6)>, <4, (2, 6, 9)>, <4, (5, 6, 8)>, <4, (5, 6, 9)>, <4, (6, 8, 9)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 4, 6} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - <5, (1, 3, 6)>, <5, (1, 6, 7)>, <5, (3, 4, 6)>, <5, (4, 6, 8)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 4, 5, 8} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
    - <6, (1, 3, 4)>, <6, (1, 3, 5)>, <6, (1, 4, 8)>, <6, (1, 5, 6)>, <6, (4, 5, 8)>, <6, (4, 5, 9)>, <6, (4, 6, 8)>, <6, (5, 6, 8)>, <6, (5, 6, 9)>, <6, (6, 8, 9)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 1} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4, 6} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {2, 4} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 26

Therefore, there are a total of [26] 3-stars in your graph.
