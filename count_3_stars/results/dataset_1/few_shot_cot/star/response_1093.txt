Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 5, 6, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - Possible 3-stars: <0, (2, 4, 5)>, <0, (2, 4, 6)>, <0, (2, 4, 9)>, <0, (2, 5, 6)>, <0, (2, 5, 9)>, <0, (2, 6, 9)>, <0, (4, 5, 6)>, <0, (4, 5, 9)>, <0, (4, 6, 9)>, <0, (5, 6, 9)>
  
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 7, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Possible 3-star: <2, (0, 7, 8)>

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Possible 3-star: <4, (0, 1, 8)>

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 6, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Possible 3-stars: <5, (0, 3, 6)>, <5, (0, 3, 7)>, <5, (0, 6, 7)>, <5, (3, 6, 7)>

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 5, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Possible 3-star: <6, (0, 5, 8)>

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Possible 3-star: <7, (2, 5, 8)>

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 4, 6, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - Possible 3-stars: <8, (1, 2, 4)>, <8, (1, 2, 6)>, <8, (1, 2, 7)>, <8, (1, 4, 6)>, <8, (1, 4, 7)>, <8, (1, 6, 7)>, <8, (2, 4, 6)>, <8, (2, 4, 7)>, <8, (2, 6, 7)>, <8, (4, 6, 7)>

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 28

Therefore, there are a total of [28] 3-stars in your graph.
