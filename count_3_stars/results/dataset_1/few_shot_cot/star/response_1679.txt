Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (2, 5) (2, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 2
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 1**: Not connected to any nodes
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
  
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 3**: Not connected to any nodes
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
  
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 6, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-Stars: <5, (2, 4, 6)>, <5, (2, 4, 7)>, <5, (2, 6, 7)>, <5, (4, 6, 7)>
  
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 5, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-Stars: <7, (0, 4, 5)>, <7, (0, 4, 6)>, <7, (0, 5, 6)>, <7, (4, 5, 6)>
  
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 9**: Not connected to any nodes
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
  
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 7: 4
Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 = 8

Therefore, there are a total of [8] 3-stars in your graph.
