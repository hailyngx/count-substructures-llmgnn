Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 1

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9} (6 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 5, 9} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {7, 8} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 4} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 6} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 7, 8} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 7} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 6} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 5} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 1} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Adding up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 20
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 26

Therefore, there are a total of [26] 3-stars in your graph.
