Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: No neighbors, cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <1, (3, 5, 8)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <3, (1, 8, 9)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 4, 6, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - <5, (1, 2, 4)>, <5, (1, 2, 6)>, <5, (1, 2, 7)>, <5, (1, 4, 6)>, <5, (1, 4, 7)>, <5, (1, 6, 7)>, <5, (2, 4, 6)>, <5, (2, 4, 7)>, <5, (2, 6, 7)>, <5, (4, 6, 7)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 5, 8, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - <7, (2, 4, 5)>, <7, (2, 4, 8)>, <7, (2, 4, 9)>, <7, (2, 5, 8)>, <7, (2, 5, 9)>, <7, (2, 8, 9)>, <7, (4, 5, 8)>, <7, (4, 5, 9)>, <7, (4, 8, 9)>, <7, (5, 8, 9)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 7, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <8, (1, 3, 7)>, <8, (1, 3, 9)>, <8, (1, 7, 9)>, <8, (3, 7, 9)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {3, 7, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <9, (3, 7, 8)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Adding all valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 27

Therefore, there are a total of [27] 3-stars in your graph.
