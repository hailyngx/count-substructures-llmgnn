Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, and node 6

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
        
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 5, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 5, 7, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3, 4, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
        
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 10
        
Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 20
        
Therefore, there are a total of [20] 3-stars in your graph.
