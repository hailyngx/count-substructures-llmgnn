Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 6, and node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {6, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 2} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {3} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2, 8, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - <6, (0, 1, 8)>, <6, (0, 2, 8)>, <6, (0, 8, 9)>, <6, (1, 8, 9)>

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {9} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {6, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 6: 10 (including unique 3-stars)
- From Node 8: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 1 = 12
Therefore, there are a total of [12] 3-stars in your graph.
