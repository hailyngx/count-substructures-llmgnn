Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 8

Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {6, 7, 8} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = inom{3}{3} = 1
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 8} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = inom{3}{3} = 1
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {6} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 9} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = inom{3}{3} = 1
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 7} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = inom{3}{3} = 1
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {7, 8} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2, 3, 7} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = inom{5}{3} = 10
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 5, 6} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = inom{4}{3} = 4
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 5, 9} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = inom{4}{3} = 4
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {3, 8} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 22

Therefore, there are a total of [22] 3-stars in your graph.
