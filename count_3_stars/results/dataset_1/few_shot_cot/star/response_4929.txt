Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 4

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node

- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 5, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 5, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2, 7, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2, 4, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {4, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 3, 5, 6} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 8**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {3, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 7: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 10 = 39

Therefore, there are a total of [39] 3-stars in your graph.
