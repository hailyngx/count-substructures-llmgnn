Node 5 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, 6, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 6, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <0, (3, 4, 6)>, <0, (3, 4, 9)>, <0, (3, 6, 9)>, <0, (4, 6, 9)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 6, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <2, (1, 4, 6)>, <2, (1, 4, 9)>, <2, (1, 6, 9)>, <2, (4, 6, 9)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 2} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {8, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 7, 8, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - <6, (0, 2, 7)>, <6, (0, 2, 8)>, <6, (0, 2, 9)>, <6, (0, 7, 8)>, <6, (0, 7, 9)>, <6, (0, 8, 9)>, <6, (2, 7, 8)>, <6, (2, 7, 9)>, <6, (2, 8, 9)>, <6, (7, 8, 9)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {3, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <8, (5, 6, 9)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 5, 6, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - <9, (0, 2, 5)>, <9, (0, 2, 6)>, <9, (0, 2, 8)>, <9, (0, 5, 6)>, <9, (0, 5, 8)>, <9, (0, 6, 8)>, <9, (2, 5, 6)>, <9, (2, 5, 8)>, <9, (2, 6, 8)>, <9, (5, 6, 8)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 10 = 29

Therefore, there are a total of [29] 3-stars in your graph.
