Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, and node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 5, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {2, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - <5, (0, 8, 9)>, <5, (1, 8, 9)>, <5, (0, 1, 8)>, <5, (0, 1, 9)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {2, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 5, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 6, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - <9, (2, 5, 6)>, <9, (2, 5, 7)>, <9, (2, 6, 7)>, <9, (5, 6, 7)>
- **Node 10**: Not listed, so it is not connected to any other nodes.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Total number of 3-stars = 1 (from Node 0) + 1 (from Node 1) + 1 (from Node 2) + 4 (from Node 5) + 1 (from Node 6) + 1 (from Node 7) + 1 (from Node 8) + 4 (from Node 9) = 14

Therefore, there are a total of [14] 3-stars in your graph.
