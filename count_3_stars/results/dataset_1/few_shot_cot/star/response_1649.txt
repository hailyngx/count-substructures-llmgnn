Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <0, (2, 4, 5)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <1, (2, 4, 8)>, <1, (2, 4, 9)>, <1, (2, 8, 9)>, <1, (4, 8, 9)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 3, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <2, (0, 1, 3)>, <2, (0, 1, 6)>, <2, (0, 3, 6)>, <2, (1, 3, 6)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 6, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <4, (0, 1, 6)>, <4, (0, 1, 7)>, <4, (0, 6, 7)>, <4, (1, 6, 7)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 6, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <5, (0, 3, 6)>, <5, (0, 3, 8)>, <5, (0, 6, 8)>, <5, (3, 6, 8)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
  - <6, (2, 4, 5)>, <6, (2, 4, 7)>, <6, (2, 4, 8)>, <6, (2, 4, 9)>, <6, (2, 5, 7)>, <6, (2, 5, 8)>, <6, (2, 5, 9)>, <6, (2, 7, 8)>, <6, (2, 7, 9)>, <6, (2, 8, 9)>, <6, (4, 5, 7)>, <6, (4, 5, 8)>, <6, (4, 5, 9)>, <6, (4, 7, 8)>, <6, (4, 7, 9)>, <6, (4, 8, 9)>, <6, (5, 7, 8)>, <6, (5, 7, 9)>, <6, (5, 8, 9)>, <6, (7, 8, 9)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 5, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <8, (1, 5, 6)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 20
- From Node 8: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 1 = 38

Therefore, there are a total of [38] 3-stars in your graph.
