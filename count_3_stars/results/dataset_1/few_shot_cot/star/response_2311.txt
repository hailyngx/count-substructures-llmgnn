Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 1

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 6, 8, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {6} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 5, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {6} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 6: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 4 = 18

Therefore, there are a total of [18] 3-stars in your graph.
