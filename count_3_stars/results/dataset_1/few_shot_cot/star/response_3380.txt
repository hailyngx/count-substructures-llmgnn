Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list provided, we'll analyze each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3, 4, 6} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = inom{5}{3} = 10
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = inom{3}{3} = 1
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 5, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = inom{4}{3} = 4
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {4, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = inom{4}{3} = 4
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 5, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = inom{3}{3} = 1
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = inom{3}{3} = 1

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 21

Therefore, there are a total of [21] 3-stars in your graph.
