Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 6

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 7, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 2**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 5, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 7
Therefore, there are a total of [7] 3-stars in your graph.
