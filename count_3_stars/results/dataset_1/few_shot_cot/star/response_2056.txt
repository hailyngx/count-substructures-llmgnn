Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list provided, we will calculate the number of 3-stars centered at each node:

- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 7, 9} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - 3-Stars: <0, (2, 4, 7)>, <0, (2, 4, 9)>, <0, (2, 7, 9)>, <0, (4, 7, 9)>
  
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 7, 8} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - 3-Stars: <1, (4, 6, 7)>, <1, (4, 6, 8)>, <1, (4, 7, 8)>, <1, (6, 7, 8)>
  
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 5, 7, 8} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - 3-Stars: <2, (0, 5, 7)>, <2, (0, 5, 8)>, <2, (0, 7, 8)>, <2, (5, 7, 8)>
  
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {9} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 5, 6, 9} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    - 3-Stars: <4, (0, 1, 5)>, <4, (0, 1, 6)>, <4, (0, 1, 9)>, <4, (0, 5, 6)>, <4, (0, 5, 9)>, <4, (0, 6, 9)>, <4, (1, 5, 6)>, <4, (1, 5, 9)>, <4, (1, 6, 9)>, <4, (5, 6, 9)>
  
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 8} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
    - 3-Star: <5, (2, 4, 8)>
  
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 7, 9} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - 3-Stars: <6, (1, 4, 7)>, <6, (1, 4, 9)>, <6, (1, 7, 9)>, <6, (4, 7, 9)>
  
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2, 6} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - 3-Stars: <7, (0, 1, 2)>, <7, (0, 1, 6)>, <7, (0, 2, 6)>, <7, (1, 2, 6)>
  
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 5, 9} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - 3-Stars: <8, (1, 2, 5)>, <8, (1, 2, 9)>, <8, (1, 5, 9)>, <8, (2, 5, 9)>
  
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 4, 6, 8} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    - 3-Stars: <9, (0, 3, 4)>, <9, (0, 3, 6)>, <9, (0, 3, 8)>, <9, (0, 4, 6)>, <9, (0, 4, 8)>, <9, (0, 6, 8)>, <9, (3, 4, 6)>, <9, (3, 4, 8)>, <9, (3, 6, 8)>, <9, (4, 6, 8)>
  
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 45

Therefore, there are a total of [45] 3-stars in your graph.
