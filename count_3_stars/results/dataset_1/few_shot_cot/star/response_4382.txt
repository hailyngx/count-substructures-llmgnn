Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 4, 5} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 6, 7, 8} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9} (6 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3}\) = 20
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2, 6, 7, 8, 9} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 7, 9} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 8} (3 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 3} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 4, 9} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3, 5, 9} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 4, 7, 8} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 20
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 66

Therefore, there are a total of [66] 3-stars in your graph.
