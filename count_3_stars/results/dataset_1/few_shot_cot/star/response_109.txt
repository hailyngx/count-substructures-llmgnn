Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 3

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 6} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 6} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {8, 9} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 5, 7, 8} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 2} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 4} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 3} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 8: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6

Therefore, there are a total of [6] 3-stars in your graph.
