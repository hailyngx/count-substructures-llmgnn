Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 3

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {3} (1 neighbor)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 9} (3 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 2**: No neighbors
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 9} (2 neighbors)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 7} (2 neighbors)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 8} (3 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {7, 8} (2 neighbors)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 6, 8} (4 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 7} (3 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 3} (2 neighbors)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 7

Therefore, there are a total of [7] 3-stars in your graph.
