Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 0
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1 
  - Unique 3-star: <2, (0, 1, 3)>

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4 
  - Unique 3-stars: <3, (2, 5, 8)>, <3, (2, 5, 9)>, <3, (2, 8, 9)>, <3, (5, 8, 9)>

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {3, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 7**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {3, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {3, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Adding the valid configurations:
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 = 5
Therefore, there are a total of [5] 3-stars in your graph.
