Node 8 is connected to node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 6, and node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
        Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
        - **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1} (1 neighbor)
        - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
        - **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 4} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
        - **Node 2**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
        - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
        - **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 7} (2 neighbors)
        - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
        - **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 6} (2 neighbors)
        - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
        - **Node 5**: Neighbors = {6} (1 neighbor)
        - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
        - **Node 6**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 9} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
        - **Node 7**: Neighbors = {3, 9} (2 neighbors)
        - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
        - **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
        - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
        - **Node 9**: Neighbors = {6, 7} (2 neighbors)
        - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
        
        Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
        Add up all the valid configurations:
        - From Node 1: 1
        - From Node 6: 1
        
        Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 = 2
        Therefore, there are a total of [2] 3-stars in your graph. This count represents how many unique 3-star subgraphs can be formed based on the adjacency list provided.
