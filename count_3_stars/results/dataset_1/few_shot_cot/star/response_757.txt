Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 9
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: No neighbors.
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 5}(2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 7, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <3, (4, 5, 7)>
  - <3, (4, 5, 9)>
  - <3, (4, 7, 9)>
  - <3, (5, 7, 9)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {3} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <5, (2, 3, 9)>
- **Node 6**: No neighbors.
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {3, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <9, (3, 5, 7)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6
Therefore, there are a total of [6] 3-stars in your graph.
