Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5

Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <1, (4, 6, 8)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3, 6, 7, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <2, (3, 7, 8)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 5, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <4, (1, 5, 7)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <6, (1, 8, 9)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <7, (2, 4, 8)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 9} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
  - <8, (1, 6, 9)>, <8, (2, 7, 9)>, <8, (3, 6, 7)>, <8, (1, 6, 7)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 6, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <9, (1, 6, 8)>
  
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
From the calculations above, the total number of 3-stars is found by adding all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 20
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 20 + 1 = 26

Therefore, there are a total of [26] 3-stars in the provided graph.
