Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 1**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 3, 4} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 9**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 7

Therefore, there are a total of [7] 3-stars in your graph.
