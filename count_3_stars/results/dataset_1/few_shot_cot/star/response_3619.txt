Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 5, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - **3-Stars**: <0, (1, 5, 8)>, <0, (1, 5, 9)>, <0, (1, 8, 9)>, <0, (5, 8, 9)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - **3-Stars**: <1, (0, 2, 4)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - **3-Stars**: <2, (1, 4, 9)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 9} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
  - **3-Stars**: <4, (1, 2, 3)>, <4, (1, 2, 5)>, <4, (1, 2, 8)>, <4, (1, 2, 9)>, <4, (1, 3, 5)>, <4, (1, 3, 8)>, <4, (1, 3, 9)>, <4, (1, 5, 8)>, <4, (1, 5, 9)>, <4, (1, 8, 9)>, <4, (2, 3, 5)>, <4, (2, 3, 8)>, <4, (2, 3, 9)>, <4, (2, 5, 8)>, <4, (2, 5, 9)>, <4, (2, 8, 9)>, <4, (3, 5, 8)>, <4, (3, 5, 9)>, <4, (3, 8, 9)>, <4, (5, 8, 9)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - **3-Stars**: <5, (0, 4, 7)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {3, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - **3-Stars**: <7, (5, 8, 9)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 6, 7, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - **3-Stars**: <8, (0, 4, 6)>, <8, (0, 4, 7)>, <8, (0, 4, 9)>, <8, (0, 6, 7)>, <8, (0, 6, 9)>, <8, (0, 7, 9)>, <8, (4, 6, 7)>, <8, (4, 6, 9)>, <8, (4, 7, 9)>, <8, (6, 7, 9)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 4, 7, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - **3-Stars**: <9, (0, 2, 4)>, <9, (0, 2, 7)>, <9, (0, 2, 8)>, <9, (0, 4, 7)>, <9, (0, 4, 8)>, <9, (0, 7, 8)>, <9, (2, 4, 7)>, <9, (2, 4, 8)>, <9, (2, 7, 8)>, <9, (4, 7, 8)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 4: 20
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 20 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 = 48

Therefore, there are a total of [48] 3-stars in your graph.
