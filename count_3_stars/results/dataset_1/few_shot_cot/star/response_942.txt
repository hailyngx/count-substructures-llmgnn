Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {3, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {7, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 5, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 9**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 8: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1
Therefore, there is a total of [1] 3-star in your graph.
