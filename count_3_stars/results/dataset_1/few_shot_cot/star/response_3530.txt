Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list provided, we'll calculate the number of 3-star configurations for each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 5, 6, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 5, 7, 8, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 6, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 4**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2, 6, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 7, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- Node 0: 1
- Node 1: 10
- Node 2: 10
- Node 3: 4
- Node 5: 10
- Node 6: 1
- Node 7: 1
- Node 8: 4
- Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 45

Therefore, there are a total of [45] 3-stars in your graph.
