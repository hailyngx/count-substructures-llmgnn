Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 6

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {8, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 5, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 6, 8, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 5, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Adding up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 = 17

Therefore, there are a total of [17] 3-stars in your graph.
