Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list provided, we will analyze each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {3, 7, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {9} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 5, 6, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <4, (1, 5, 9)>, <4, (1, 6, 9)>, <4, (5, 6, 9)>, <4, (1, 5, 6)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 6, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <7, (0, 6, 9)>, <7, (0, 8, 9)>, <7, (6, 8, 9)>, <7, (0, 6, 8)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - <8, (1, 3, 9)>, <8, (1, 5, 9)>, <8, (1, 7, 9)>, <8, (3, 5, 9)>, <8, (3, 7, 9)>, <8, (5, 7, 9)>, <8, (1, 3, 5)>, <8, (1, 3, 7)>, <8, (1, 5, 7)>, <8, (3, 5, 7)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8} (7 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{7}{3} = 35\)
  - <9, (0, 3, 7)>, <9, (0, 3, 8)>, <9, (0, 3, 9)>, <9, (0, 7, 8)>, <9, (0, 7, 9)>, <9, (0, 8, 9)>, <9, (3, 7, 8)>, <9, (3, 7, 9)>, <9, (3, 8, 9)>, <9, (7, 8, 9)>, <9, (1, 4, 5)>, <9, (1, 4, 8)>, <9, (1, 5, 8)>, <9, (1, 4, 9)>, <9, (1, 5, 9)>, <9, (1, 8, 9)>, <9, (4, 5, 8)>, <9, (4, 5, 9)>, <9, (4, 8, 9)>, <9, (5, 8, 9)>, <9, (4, 6, 7)>, <9, (4, 6, 9)>, <9, (4, 7, 9)>, <9, (6, 7, 9)>, <9, (1, 3, 4)>, <9, (1, 3, 5)>, <9, (1, 3, 7)>, <9, (1, 3, 9)>, <9, (1, 4, 6)>, <9, (1, 6, 9)>, <9, (1, 3, 8)>, <9, (1, 7, 8)>, <9, (1, 8, 9)>, <9, (3, 4, 6)>, <9, (3, 6, 7)>, <9, (3, 7, 8)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 35

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 35 = 58

Therefore, there are a total of [58] 3-stars in your graph.
