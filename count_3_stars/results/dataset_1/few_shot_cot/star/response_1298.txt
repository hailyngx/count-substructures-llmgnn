Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 6, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {9} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {9} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 6, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <4, (0, 6, 8)>, <4, (0, 6, 9)>, <4, (0, 8, 9)>, <4, (6, 8, 9)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 4, 6, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - <9, (1, 4, 6)>, <9, (1, 4, 8)>, <9, (1, 6, 8)>, <9, (4, 6, 8)>, <9, (4, 6, 9)>, <9, (4, 8, 9)>, <9, (6, 8, 9)>, <9, (1, 6, 9)>, <9, (1, 8, 9)>, <9, (6, 8, 9)>
  
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 9: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 17
Therefore, there are a total of [17] 3-stars in your graph.
