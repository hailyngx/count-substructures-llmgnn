Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node  
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {3} (1 neighbor)  
Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.  

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 3} (2 neighbors)  
Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.  

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 9} (3 neighbors)  
Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)  
<2, (1, 4, 9)>  

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 4, 9} (4 neighbors)  
Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)  
<3, (0, 1, 4)>, <3, (0, 4, 9)>, <3, (1, 4, 9)>, <3, (0, 1, 9)>  

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {2, 3} (2 neighbors)  
Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.  

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor)  
Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.  

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)  
Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.  

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)  
Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.  

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {6, 9} (2 neighbors)  
Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.  

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 8} (3 neighbors)  
Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)  
<9, (2, 3, 8)>  

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars  
Add up all the valid configurations:  
- From Node 2: 1  
- From Node 3: 4  
- From Node 9: 1  

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6  
Therefore, there are a total of [6] 3-stars in your graph.
