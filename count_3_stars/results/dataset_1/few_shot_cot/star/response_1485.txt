Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 3

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 8} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 9} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 9} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 8} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 6} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {2, 3} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
    
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 8: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 = 2

Therefore, there are a total of [2] 3-stars in your graph. 

The unique 3-stars are: 
<1, (2, 3, 8)>
<8, (1, 4, 6)>
