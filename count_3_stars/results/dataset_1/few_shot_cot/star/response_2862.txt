Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8} (7 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{7}{3}\) = 35
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 4, 6, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 1} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3}\) = 20
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 7, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 5, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {2, 7, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 35
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 4: 20
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 35 + 10 + 20 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 69

Therefore, there are a total of [69] 3-stars in your graph.
