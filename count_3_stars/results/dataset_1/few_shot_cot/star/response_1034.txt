Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 7
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 5

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 1**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 7, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2, 6, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations =  \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 2} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {3, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 10

Therefore, there are a total of [10] 3-stars in your graph.
