Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 5
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 5

Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 6, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 20
- From Node 5: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 4 = 24
Therefore, there are a total of [24] 3-stars in your graph. This count represents how many unique 3-star subgraphs can be formed based on the adjacency list provided.
