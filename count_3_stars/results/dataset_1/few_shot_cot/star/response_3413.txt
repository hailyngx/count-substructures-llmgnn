Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 6

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 4, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 4, 5, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {7, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 5, 7, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 7, 8, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {8, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8} (7 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{7}{3} = 35\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 5, 6, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 7: 35
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 35 + 10 + 1 = 82

Therefore, there are a total of [82] 3-stars in your graph.
