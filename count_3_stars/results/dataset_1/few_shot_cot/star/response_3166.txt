Node 6 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 5, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 5, 7, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - <1, (0, 4, 5)>, <1, (0, 5, 7)>, <1, (0, 7, 8)>, <1, (4, 5, 7)>, <1, (4, 7, 8)>, <1, (5, 7, 8)>, <1, (0, 4, 7)>, <1, (0, 4, 8)>, <1, (0, 5, 8)>, <1, (4, 5, 8)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {6, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0} (1 neighbor)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 6, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <4, (1, 6, 8)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 7, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <5, (1, 7, 9)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <6, (4, 2, 7)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 5, 6, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - <7, (1, 5, 8)>, <7, (1, 6, 8)>, <7, (5, 6, 8)>, <7, (1, 2, 8)>, <7, (1, 2, 5)>, <7, (2, 5, 6)>, <7, (2, 6, 8)>, <7, (1, 2, 6)>, <7, (1, 5, 6)>, <7, (5, 6, 8)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 7, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <8, (1, 7, 9)>, <8, (1, 4, 9)>, <8, (1, 4, 7)>, <8, (4, 7, 9)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 27

Therefore, there are a total of [27] 3-stars in your graph.
