Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 5) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 5

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 6, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Possible 3-stars: <0, (2, 6, 8)>, <0, (2, 6, 9)>, <0, (2, 8, 9)>, <0, (6, 8, 9)>
  
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Possible 3-star: <1, (4, 5, 6)>
  
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Possible 3-star: <3, (2, 5, 6)>
  
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 6, 7, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - Possible 3-stars: <5, (1, 3, 6)>, <5, (1, 3, 9)>, <5, (1, 6, 7)>, <5, (1, 6, 9)>, <5, (1, 7, 9)>, <5, (3, 6, 7)>, <5, (3, 6, 9)>, <5, (3, 7, 9)>, <5, (6, 7, 9)>, <5, (1, 6, 7)>
  
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 3, 5} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Possible 3-stars: <6, (0, 1, 3)>, <6, (0, 1, 5)>, <6, (0, 3, 5)>, <6, (1, 3, 5)>
  
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 20

Therefore, there are a total of [20] 3-stars in your graph.
