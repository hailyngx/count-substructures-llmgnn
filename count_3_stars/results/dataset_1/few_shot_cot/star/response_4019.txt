Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 6, 8, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - 3-stars: <0, (1, 6, 8)>, <0, (1, 6, 9)>, <0, (1, 8, 9)>, <0, (4, 6, 8)>, <0, (4, 6, 9)>, <0, (4, 8, 9)>, <0, (6, 8, 9)>, <0, (1, 6, 8)>, <0, (1, 8, 9)>, <0, (6, 8, 9)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 3, 6, 8, 9} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
  - 3-stars: <1, (0, 6, 8)>, <1, (0, 6, 9)>, <1, (0, 8, 9)>, <1, (2, 3, 6)>, <1, (2, 3, 8)>, <1, (2, 6, 8)>, <1, (2, 6, 9)>, <1, (3, 6, 8)>, <1, (3, 6, 9)>, <1, (3, 8, 9)>, <1, (6, 8, 9)>, <1, (0, 6, 8)>, <1, (0, 6, 9)>, <1, (0, 8, 9)>, <1, (6, 8, 9)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 5, 6, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - 3-stars: <3, (1, 6, 8)>, <3, (1, 6, 9)>, <3, (1, 8, 9)>, <3, (2, 5, 6)>, <3, (2, 5, 8)>, <3, (2, 6, 8)>, <3, (5, 6, 8)>, <3, (1, 6, 8)>, <3, (1, 8, 9)>, <3, (6, 8, 9)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {3} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 3, 7, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - 3-stars: <6, (0, 1, 8)>, <6, (0, 1, 9)>, <6, (0, 8, 9)>, <6, (1, 3, 8)>, <6, (1, 3, 9)>, <6, (1, 8, 9)>, <6, (3, 8, 9)>, <6, (0, 1, 8)>, <6, (0, 8, 9)>, <6, (1, 8, 9)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {6, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 3, 6, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - 3-stars: <8, (0, 1, 6)>, <8, (0, 1, 9)>, <8, (0, 6, 9)>, <8, (1, 3, 6)>, <8, (1, 3, 9)>, <8, (1, 6, 9)>, <8, (3, 6, 9)>, <8, (0, 1, 6)>, <8, (0, 6, 9)>, <8, (1, 6, 9)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - 3-stars: <9, (0, 1, 4)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 1: 20
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 1
Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 = 61
Therefore, there are a total of [61] 3-stars in your graph.
