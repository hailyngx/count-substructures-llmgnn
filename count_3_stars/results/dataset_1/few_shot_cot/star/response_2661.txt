Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 7

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the provided graph, we will calculate the number of 3-stars centered at each node and then sum them up. 

Calculating the 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 5, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Unique 3-stars: 
    - <0, (1, 2, 5)>
    - <0, (1, 2, 9)>
    - <0, (1, 5, 9)>
    - <0, (2, 5, 9)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 4, 6, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - Unique 3-stars:
    - <2, (0, 3, 4)>
    - <2, (0, 3, 6)>
    - <2, (0, 3, 8)>
    - <2, (0, 4, 6)>
    - <2, (0, 4, 8)>
    - <2, (0, 6, 8)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2, 6, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Unique 3-star: 
    - <3, (2, 6, 9)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {2, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {9} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 3, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Unique 3-stars:
    - <9, (0, 1, 3)>
    - <9, (0, 1, 7)>
    - <9, (0, 3, 7)>
    - <9, (1, 3, 7)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Adding the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 = 19

Therefore, there are a total of [19] 3-stars in the given graph.
