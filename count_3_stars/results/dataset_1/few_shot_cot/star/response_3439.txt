Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list provided, we'll analyze each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 6, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Possible 3-stars: <0, (1, 2, 6)>, <0, (1, 2, 9)>, <0, (1, 6, 9)>, <0, (2, 6, 9)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Possible 3-stars: <1, (0, 3, 5)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {9} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Possible 3-stars: <7, (2, 3, 8)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {7, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Possible 3-stars: <9, (0, 4, 8)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 7

Therefore, there are a total of [7] 3-stars in your graph.
