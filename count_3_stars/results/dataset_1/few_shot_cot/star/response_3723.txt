Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: No neighbors, cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 6, 9} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - <1, (3, 6, 9)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 6, 7, 8} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
    - <2, (4, 5, 6)>, <2, (4, 5, 7)>, <2, (4, 5, 8)>, <2, (4, 6, 7)>, <2, (4, 6, 8)>, <2, (4, 7, 8)>, <2, (5, 6, 7)>, <2, (5, 6, 8)>, <2, (5, 7, 8)>, <2, (6, 7, 8)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 4} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9} (6 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
    - <4, (2, 3, 5)>, <4, (2, 3, 7)>, <4, (2, 3, 8)>, <4, (2, 3, 9)>, <4, (2, 5, 7)>, <4, (2, 5, 8)>, <4, (2, 5, 9)>, <4, (2, 7, 8)>, <4, (2, 7, 9)>, <4, (2, 8, 9)>, <4, (3, 5, 7)>, <4, (3, 5, 8)>, <4, (3, 5, 9)>, <4, (3, 7, 8)>, <4, (3, 7, 9)>, <4, (3, 8, 9)>, <4, (5, 7, 8)>, <4, (5, 7, 9)>, <4, (5, 8, 9)>, <4, (7, 8, 9)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 8} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - <5, (2, 4, 8)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 7} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - <6, (1, 2, 7)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 6} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - <7, (2, 4, 6)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 5} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - <8, (2, 4, 5)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 4} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 4: 20
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 20 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 35

Therefore, there are a total of [35] 3-stars in your graph.
