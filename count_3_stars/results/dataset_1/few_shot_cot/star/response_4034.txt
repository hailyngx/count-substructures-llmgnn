Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 6, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <2, (0, 1, 6)>, <2, (0, 1, 7)>, <2, (0, 6, 7)>, <2, (1, 6, 7)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {3, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {2, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <8, (4, 6, 7)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 8: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 = 5
Therefore, there are a total of [5] 3-stars in your graph.
