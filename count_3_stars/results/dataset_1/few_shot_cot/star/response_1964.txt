Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, and node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 5, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {9} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 6, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 6, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 11
Therefore, there are a total of [11] 3-stars in your graph.
