Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {3, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-star: <1, (2, 3, 9)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 4, 5} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-star: <3, (0, 4, 5)>, <3, (1, 4, 5)>, <3, (0, 1, 4)>, <3, (0, 1, 5)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-star: <4, (3, 5, 7)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {3, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {8, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {6, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 6, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-star: <9, (0, 1, 6)>, <9, (0, 1, 8)>, <9, (0, 6, 8)>, <9, (1, 6, 8)>
  
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 10

Therefore, there are a total of [10] 3-stars in your graph.
