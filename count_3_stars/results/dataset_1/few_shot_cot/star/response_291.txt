Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 5, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <0, (3, 4, 5)>, <0, (3, 4, 8)>, <0, (3, 5, 8)>, <0, (4, 5, 8)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 7, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <1, (2, 7, 9)>, <1, (2, 4, 9)>, <1, (4, 7, 9)>, <1, (2, 4, 7)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 7, 8} (4 neighbors)

  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <4, (0, 1, 2)>, <4, (0, 1, 6)>, <4, (0, 1, 7)>, <4, (0, 1, 8)>, <4, (0, 2, 6)>, <4, (0, 2, 7)>, <4, (0, 2, 8)>, <4, (0, 6, 7)>, <4, (0, 6, 8)>, <4, (0, 7, 8)>, <4, (1, 2, 6)>, <4, (1, 2, 7)>, <4, (1, 2, 8)>, <4, (1, 6, 7)>, <4, (1, 6, 8)>, <4, (1, 7, 8)>, <4, (2, 6, 7)>, <4, (2, 6, 8)>, <4, (2, 7, 8)>, <4, (6, 7, 8)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <6, (3, 4, 7)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 4, 6, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <7, (1, 2, 4)>, <7, (1, 2, 6)>, <7, (1, 2, 8)>, <7, (1, 4, 6)>, <7, (1, 4, 8)>, <7, (1, 6, 8)>, <7, (2, 4, 6)>, <7, (2, 4, 8)>, <7, (2, 6, 8)>, <7, (4, 6, 8)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <8, (0, 3, 5)>, <8, (0, 3, 7)>, <8, (0, 4, 5)>, <8, (0, 4, 7)>, <8, (0, 5, 7)>, <8, (2, 3, 5)>, <8, (2, 3, 7)>, <8, (2, 4, 5)>, <8, (2, 4, 7)>, <8, (2, 5, 7)>, <8, (3, 4, 5)>, <8, (3, 4, 7)>, <8, (3, 5, 7)>, <8, (4, 5, 6)>, <8, (4, 5, 7)>, <8, (4, 6, 7)>, <8, (4, 6, 7)>, <8, (5, 6, 7)>, <8, (1, 4, 7)>, <8, (1, 7, 9)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 20
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 20

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 20 + 1 + 10 + 20 = 64

Therefore, there are a total of [64] 3-stars in your graph.
