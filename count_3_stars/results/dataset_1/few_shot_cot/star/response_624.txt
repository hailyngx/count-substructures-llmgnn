Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 8
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, and node 4

Response:
Calculating the number of 3-stars in the provided graph:

- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 7, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-star: <1, (3, 7, 9)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 7, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-stars: <2, (3, 5, 7)>, <2, (3, 7, 9)>, <2, (5, 7, 9)>, <2, (3, 5, 9)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 5, 7, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - 3-stars: <3, (1, 2, 5)>, <3, (1, 2, 7)>, <3, (1, 2, 9)>, <3, (1, 5, 7)>, <3, (1, 5, 9)>, <3, (1, 7, 9)>, <3, (2, 5, 7)>, <3, (2, 5, 9)>, <3, (2, 7, 9)>, <3, (5, 7, 9)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-star: <5, (2, 3, 8)>
- **Node 6**: Not connected to any other nodes.
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-star: <7, (1, 2, 3)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - 3-stars: <9, (0, 1, 2)>, <9, (0, 1, 3)>, <9, (0, 1, 4)>, <9, (0, 2, 3)>, <9, (0, 2, 4)>, <9, (0, 3, 4)>, <9, (1, 2, 3)>, <9, (1, 2, 4)>, <9, (1, 3, 4)>, <9, (2, 3, 4)> 

Summing up the total number of 3-stars:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 9: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 27

Therefore, there are a total of [27] 3-stars in your graph.
