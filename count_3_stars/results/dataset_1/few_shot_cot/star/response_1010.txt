Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (4, 2) (5, 1) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: No neighbors, cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <1, (5, 7, 9)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: No neighbors, cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
- From Node 1: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1

Therefore, there are a total of [1] 3-stars in your graph.
