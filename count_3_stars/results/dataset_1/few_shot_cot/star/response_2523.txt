Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 0

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0:** Neighbors = {2, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1:** Neighbors = {5, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2:** Neighbors = {0, 3, 5, 6, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - Three stars involving Node 2: <2, (0, 3, 5)>, <2, (0, 3, 6)>, <2, (0, 3, 8)>, <2, (0, 5, 6)>, <2, (0, 5, 8)>, <2, (0, 6, 8)>, <2, (3, 5, 6)>, <2, (3, 5, 8)>, <2, (3, 6, 8)>, <2, (5, 6, 8)>
- **Node 3:** Neighbors = {2, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4:** Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5:** Neighbors = {1, 2, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Three stars involving Node 5: <5, (1, 2, 7)>
- **Node 6:** Neighbors = {2, 3, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Three stars involving Node 6: <6, (2, 3, 7)>
- **Node 7:** Neighbors = {1, 4, 5, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Three stars involving Node 7: <7, (1, 4, 5)>, <7, (1, 4, 6)>, <7, (1, 5, 6)>, <7, (4, 5, 6)>
- **Node 8:** Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9:** Neighbors = {0} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 2: 10 3-stars
- From Node 5: 1 3-star
- From Node 6: 1 3-star
- From Node 7: 4 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 16

Therefore, there are a total of [16] 3-stars in the given graph.
