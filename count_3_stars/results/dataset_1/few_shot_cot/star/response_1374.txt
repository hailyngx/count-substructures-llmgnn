Node 6 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 4

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - <0, (3, 5, 6)>

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - <2, (4, 5, 7)>

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 7, 8, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
  - <3, (0, 4, 7)>, <3, (0, 4, 8)>, <3, (0, 4, 9)>, <3, (4, 7, 8)>, <3, (4, 7, 9)>, <3, (4, 8, 9)>, <3, (7, 8, 9)>, <3, (0, 7, 8)>, <3, (0, 7, 9)>, <3, (0, 8, 9)>

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3, 6, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
  - <4, (1, 2, 3)>, <4, (1, 2, 6)>, <4, (1, 2, 9)>, <4, (1, 3, 6)>, <4, (1, 3, 9)>, <4, (1, 6, 9)>, <4, (2, 3, 6)>, <4, (2, 3, 9)>, <4, (2, 6, 9)>, <4, (3, 6, 9)>

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - <5, (0, 1, 2)>, <5, (0, 1, 8)>, <5, (0, 2, 8)>, <5, (1, 2, 8)>

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - <6, (0, 4, 8)>

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - <8, (3, 5, 6)>

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {3, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 8: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 28

Therefore, there are a total of [28] 3-stars in your graph.
