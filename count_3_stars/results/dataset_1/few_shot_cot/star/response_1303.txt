Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 6, 7, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {3, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 7

Therefore, there are a total of [7] 3-stars in your graph.
