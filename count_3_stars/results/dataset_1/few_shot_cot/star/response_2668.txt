Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 3
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 7, 8} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - Unique 3-stars:
      - <0, (2, 3, 7)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 7} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 4, 5} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - Unique 3-stars:
      - <2, (0, 3, 5)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2, 5} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - Unique 3-stars:
      - <3, (0, 1, 2)>
      - <3, (0, 2, 5)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 6**: No neighbors
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 1} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 9} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 2

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 5

Therefore, there are a total of [5] 3-stars in your graph.
