Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 8) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 4

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {9} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.  
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 3, 7, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 4: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 = 11

Therefore, there are a total of [11] 3-stars in your graph.
