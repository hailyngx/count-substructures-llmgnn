Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 5, 8, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - 3-Stars:
    - <2, (0, 3, 5)>
    - <2, (0, 5, 8)>
    - <2, (3, 5, 8)>
    - <2, (5, 8, 9)>

    - <2, (0, 8, 9)>
    - <2, (3, 5, 9)>
    - <2, (0, 8, 5)>

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 5, 6, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9} (7 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{7}{3} = 35\)

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {4, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3, 5, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)  
  - 3-Stars:
    - <8, (1, 2, 3)>
    - <8, (1, 2, 5)>
    - <8, (1, 2, 9)>
    - <8, (1, 3, 5)>

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 5, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
- Total number of 3-stars = 10 (from Node 2) + 35 (from Node 5) + 10 (from Node 8) = 55
Therefore, there are a total of [55] 3-stars in your graph.
