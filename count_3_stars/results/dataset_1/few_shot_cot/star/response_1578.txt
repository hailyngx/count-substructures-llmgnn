Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 7, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {7, 8} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 6, 7, 8} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 7} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Not connected to any other nodes.
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Not connected to any other nodes.
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 8} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 8} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2, 9} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 5, 6, 9} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {7, 8} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 10 = 24

Therefore, there are a total of [24] 3-stars in your graph.
