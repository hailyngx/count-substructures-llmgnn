Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 4} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
    - 3-star: <0, (1, 2, 4)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 2} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 3} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
    - 3-star: <2, (0, 1, 3)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2, 6, 7, 8} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - 3-stars: <3, (2, 6, 7)>, <3, (2, 6, 8)>, <3, (2, 7, 8)>, <3, (6, 7, 8)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 6, 9} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
    - 3-star: <4, (0, 6, 9)>
- **Node 5**: No neighbors
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 9} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
    - 3-star: <6, (3, 4, 9)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {3, 8} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {3, 7, 9} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
    - 3-star: <8, (3, 7, 9)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 8} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
    - 3-star: <9, (4, 6, 8)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 10

Therefore, there are a total of [10] 3-stars in your graph.
