Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {7, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 1**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
  
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {6} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {3, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {3, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 5, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 3: 1 configuration
- From Node 5: 1 configuration
- From Node 6: 1 configuration
- From Node 8: 4 configurations
- From Node 9: 1 configuration

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 8

Therefore, there are a total of [8] 3-stars in your graph.
