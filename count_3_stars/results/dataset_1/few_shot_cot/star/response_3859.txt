Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - 3-star: <1, (5, 7, 8)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 5, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - 3-stars: <2, (3, 4, 5)>, <2, (3, 4, 8)>, <2, (3, 5, 8)>, <2, (4, 5, 8)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2, 6, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - 3-star: <3, (2, 6, 8)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {2, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - 3-stars: <5, (0, 1, 2)>, <5, (0, 1, 6)>, <5, (0, 2, 6)>, <5, (1, 2, 6)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - 3-star: <6, (3, 5, 8)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9} (7 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{7}{3}\) = 35
  - 3-stars: <8, (0, 1, 2)>, <8, (0, 1, 3)>, <8, (0, 1, 4)>, <8, (0, 1, 6)>, <8, (0, 1, 9)>, <8, (0, 2, 3)>, <8, (0, 2, 4)>, <8, (0, 2, 6)>, <8, (0, 2, 9)>, <8, (0, 3, 4)>, <8, (0, 3, 6)>, <8, (0, 3, 9)>, <8, (0, 4, 6)>, <8, (0, 4, 9)>, <8, (0, 6, 9)>, <8, (1, 2, 3)>, <8, (1, 2, 4)>, <8, (1, 2, 6)>, <8, (1, 2, 9)>, <8, (1, 3, 4)>, <8, (1, 3, 6)>, <8, (1, 3, 9)>, <8, (1, 4, 6)>, <8, (1, 4, 9)>, <8, (1, 6, 9)>, <8, (2, 3, 4)>, <8, (2, 3, 6)>, <8, (2, 3, 9)>, <8, (2, 4, 6)>, <8, (2, 4, 9)>, <8, (2, 6, 9)>, <8, (3, 4, 6)>, <8, (3, 4, 9)>, <8, (3, 6, 9)>, <8, (4, 6, 9)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 8: 35

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 35 = 46

Therefore, there are a total of [46] 3-stars in your graph.
