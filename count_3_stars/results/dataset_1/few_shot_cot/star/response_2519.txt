Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 3
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 4, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 5**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 2} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {7, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6
Therefore, there are a total of [6] 3-stars in your graph.
