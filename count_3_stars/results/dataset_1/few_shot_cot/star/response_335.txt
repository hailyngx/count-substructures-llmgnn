Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 2

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-stars:
    - <2, (4, 5, 8)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 6, 7, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - Unique 3-stars:
    - <4, (2, 5, 8)>
    - <4, (5, 6, 7)>
    - <4, (5, 7, 8)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2, 4, 7, 8} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
  - Unique 3-stars:
    - <5, (0, 2, 4)>
    - <5, (0, 2, 7)>
    - <5, (2, 4, 7)>
    - <5, (4, 6, 7)>
    - <5, (4, 7, 8)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-stars:
    - <6, (4, 7, 8)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 5, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-stars:
    - <7, (0, 4, 5)>
    - <7, (4, 5, 6)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 4, 5, 6} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - Unique 3-stars:
    - <8, (2, 4, 5)>
    - <8, (4, 5, 6)>
    - <8, (5, 6, 8)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 4: 3
- From Node 5: 5
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 2
- From Node 8: 3

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 3 + 5 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 15

Therefore, there are a total of [15] 3-stars in your graph.
