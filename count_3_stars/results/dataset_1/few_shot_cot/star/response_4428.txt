Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {6, 7, 9} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 7} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: No neighbors
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 5, 7} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 8} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {3} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 3, 4, 9} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4, 6} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 6, 7} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 14
Therefore, there are a total of [14] 3-stars in your graph.
