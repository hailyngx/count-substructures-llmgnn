Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 5, 6, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - <0, (1, 5, 7)>, <0, (1, 5, 7)>, <0, (1, 5, 6)>, <0, (1, 6, 7)>, <0, (5, 6, 7)>, <0, (1, 3, 7)>, <0, (1, 3, 6)>, <0, (3, 5, 6)>, <0, (1, 5, 3)>, <0, (5, 6, 7)>

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9} (7 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{7}{3} = 35\)
  - <1, (0, 7, 9)>, <1, (0, 8, 9)>, <1, (0, 7, 8)>, <1, (0, 3, 9)>, <1, (0, 5, 9)>, <1, (0, 3, 5)>, <1, (0, 5, 7)>, <1, (0, 3, 7)>, <1, (2, 3, 8)>, <1, (2, 8, 9)>, <1, (2, 3, 9)>, <1, (2, 3, 5)>, <1, (2, 5, 7)>, <1, (2, 3, 7)>, <1, (2, 5, 9)>, <1, (2, 7, 8)>, <1, (2, 7, 9)>, <1, (3, 8, 9)>,  <1, (3, 4, 8)>, <1, (3, 8, 9)>, <1, (3, 4, 9)>, <1, (3, 4, 7)>, <1, (5, 7, 9)>, <1, (5, 9, 8)>, <1, (4, 7, 8)>, <1, (4, 8, 9)>, <1, (0, 5, 7)>, <1, (0, 3, 9)>, <1, (0, 3, 5)>, <1, (0, 3, 7)>, <1, (0, 3, 5)>, <1, (0, 7, 5)>, <1, (4, 7, 8)>, <1, (4, 8, 9)>

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2, 4, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - <3, (0, 1, 8)>, <3, (0, 1, 4)>, <3, (0, 4, 8)>, <3, (1, 4, 8)>, <3, (1, 8, 9)>, <3, (1, 4, 9)>, <3, (1, 4, 7)>, <3, (1, 7, 8)>, <3, (1, 7, 4)>, <3, (4, 7, 8)>

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {3, 6, 7, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <5, (0, 1, 9)>

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <7, (0, 1, 4)>

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 4, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 5, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <9, (1, 5, 8)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 1: 35
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 35 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 58

Therefore, there are a total of [58] 3-stars in your graph.
