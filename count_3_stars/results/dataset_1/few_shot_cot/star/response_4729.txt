Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 5
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Not connected to any other nodes.
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {7, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Not connected to any other nodes.
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 6, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Total 3-stars: <5, (0, 6, 8)>, <5, (0, 3, 6)>, <5, (0, 6, 8)>, <5, (3, 6, 8)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Total 3-stars: <8, (2, 5, 9)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
There are 6 unique 3-stars found in the graph:
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 8: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 = 5

Therefore, there are a total of [5] 3-stars in your graph.
