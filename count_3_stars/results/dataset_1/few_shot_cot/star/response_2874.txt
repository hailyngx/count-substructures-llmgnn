Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  <0, (3, 5, 9)>
  
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {9} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {7, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {6, 7, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  <4, (6, 7, 8)>
  
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 6, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  <5, (0, 8, 9)>, <5, (6, 8, 9)>, <5, (0, 6, 9)>, <5, (0, 6, 8)>
  
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  <6, (4, 5, 9)>
  
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  <7, (2, 4, 9)>
  
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7} (7 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \)
  <9, (0, 1, 2)>, <9, (0, 1, 3)>, <9, (0, 1, 5)>, <9, (0, 1, 6)>, <9, (0, 1, 7)>, <9, (0, 2, 3)>, <9, (0, 2, 5)>, <9, (0, 2, 6)>, <9, (0, 2, 7)>, <9, (0, 3, 5)>, <9, (0, 3, 6)>, <9, (0, 3, 7)>, <9, (0, 5, 6)>, <9, (0, 5, 7)>, <9, (0, 6, 7)>, <9, (1, 2, 3)>, <9, (1, 2, 5)>, <9, (1, 2, 6)>, <9, (1, 2, 7)>, <9, (1, 3, 5)>, <9, (1, 3, 6)>, <9, (1, 3, 7)>, <9, (1, 5, 6)>, <9, (1, 5, 7)>, <9, (1, 6, 7)>, <9, (2, 3, 5)>, <9, (2, 3, 6)>, <9, (2, 3, 7)>, <9, (2, 5, 6)>, <9, (2, 5, 7)>, <9, (2, 6, 7)>, <9, (3, 5, 6)>, <9, (3, 5, 7)>, <9, (3, 6, 7)>, <9, (5, 6, 7)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 9: 35
Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 35 = 43

Therefore, there are a total of [43] 3-stars in your graph.
