Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 6

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 9} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 8} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - 3-Star: <1, (2, 4, 8)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 8} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - 3-Star: <3, (4, 6, 8)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 7} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - 3-Star: <4, (1, 3, 7)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 6, 7, 9} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - 3-Stars: <5, (0, 6, 9)>, <5, (0, 7, 9)>, <5, (6, 7, 9)>, <5, (0, 6, 7)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 7, 9} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - 3-Stars: <6, (3, 5, 9)>, <6, (3, 7, 9)>, <6, (5, 7, 9)>, <6, (3, 5, 7)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 6} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - 3-Star: <7, (4, 5, 6)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 3} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 5, 6} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - 3-Star: <9, (0, 5, 6)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 13

Therefore, there are a total of [13] 3-stars in your graph.
