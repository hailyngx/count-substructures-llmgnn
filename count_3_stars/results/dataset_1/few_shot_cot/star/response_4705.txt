Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 6) (3, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 3) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 1

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {7, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {6, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 2} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <6, (0, 2, 3)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
- From Node 6: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1

Therefore, there are a total of [1] 3-stars in your graph.
