Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 4

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {8, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {6, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - <3, (1, 4, 8)> is a 3-star.
  
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {3, 7, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - <4, (3, 7, 9)> is a 3-star.
  
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {7, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 5, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - <7, (2, 4, 8)> is a 3-star.
  - <7, (2, 5, 8)> is a 3-star.
  
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 3, 5, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - <8, (0, 1, 3)> is a 3-star.
  - <8, (0, 1, 5)> is a 3-star.
  - <8, (0, 3, 7)> is a 3-star.
  - <8, (0, 5, 7)> is a 3-star.
  - <8, (1, 3, 7)> is a 3-star.
  
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - <9, (0, 3, 4)> is a 3-star.
  
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Adding all the valid configurations:
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 7: 2
- From Node 8: 5
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 2 + 5 + 1 = 10

Therefore, there are a total of [10] 3-stars in your graph.
