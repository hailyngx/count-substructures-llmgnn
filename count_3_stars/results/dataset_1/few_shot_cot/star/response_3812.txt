Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list provided, we'll analyze each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 5, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3} {3} = 1\)
  - 3-stars involving Node 0: <0, (1, 5, 7)>

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 5, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3} {3} = 1\)
  - 3-stars involving Node 1: <1, (0, 5, 9)>

- **Node 2**: Isolated node with no neighbors, cannot form a 3-star.

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {6, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3} {3} = 1\)
  - 3-stars involving Node 3: <3, (6, 8, 9)>

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 7, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4} {3} = 4\)
  - 3-stars involving Node 4: <4, (5, 6, 7)>, <4, (5, 6, 8)>, <4, (5, 7, 8)>, <4, (6, 7, 8)>

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3} {3} = 1\)
  - 3-stars involving Node 5: <5, (0, 1, 4)>

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4} {3} = 4\)
  - 3-stars involving Node 6: <6, (3, 4, 8)>, <6, (3, 4, 9)>, <6, (3, 8, 9)>, <6, (4, 8, 9)>

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3} {3} = 1\)
  - 3-stars involving Node 7: <7, (0, 4, 9)>

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3} {3} = 1\)
  - 3-stars involving Node 8: <8, (3, 4, 6)>

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 6, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4} {3} = 4\)
  - 3-stars involving Node 9: <9, (1, 3, 6)>, <9, (1, 3, 7)>, <9, (1, 6, 7)>, <9, (3, 6, 7)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Adding up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 18

Therefore, there are a total of [18] 3-stars in your graph.
