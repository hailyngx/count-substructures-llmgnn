Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 4, 5} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Possible 3-stars: <0, (1, 2, 4)>, <0, (1, 2, 5)>, <0, (1, 4, 5)>, <0, (2, 4, 5)>
  
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 6, 8, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - Possible 3-stars: <1, (0, 4, 6)>, <1, (0, 4, 8)>, <1, (0, 4, 9)>, <1, (0, 6, 8)>, <1, (0, 6, 9)>, <1, (0, 8, 9)>, <1, (4, 6, 8)>, <1, (4, 6, 9)>, <1, (4, 8, 9)>, <1, (6, 8, 9)>

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 6, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Possible 3-stars: <2, (0, 6, 7)>

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {6, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Possible 3-stars: <3, (6, 8, 9)>

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 6, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Possible 3-stars: <4, (0, 1, 6)>, <4, (0, 1, 9)>, <4, (0, 6, 9)>, <4, (1, 6, 9)>

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3, 4} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Possible 3-stars: <6, (1, 2, 3)>, <6, (1, 2, 4)>, <6, (1, 3, 4)>, <6, (2, 3, 4)>

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Possible 3-stars: <9, (1, 3, 4)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Adding the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 6: 4
Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 24

Therefore, there are a total of [24] 3-stars in your graph.
