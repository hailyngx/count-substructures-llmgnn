Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 7, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 5, 8, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - <0, (3, 4, 5)>, <0, (3, 4, 8)>, <0, (3, 4, 9)>, <0, (3, 5, 8)>, <0, (3, 5, 9)>, <0, (3, 8, 9)>, <0, (4, 5, 8)>, <0, (4, 5, 9)>, <0, (4, 8, 9)>, <0, (5, 8, 9)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - <1, (3, 4, 9)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {8, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - <3, (0, 1, 6)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 5, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - <4, (0, 1, 5)>, <4, (0, 1, 6)>, <4, (0, 5, 6)>, <4, (1, 5, 6)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {3, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {9} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - <8, (0, 2, 9)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2, 7, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - <9, (0, 1, 2)>, <9, (0, 1, 7)>, <9, (0, 1, 8)>, <9, (0, 2, 7)>, <9, (0, 2, 8)>, <9, (0, 7, 8)>, <9, (1, 2, 7)>, <9, (1, 2, 8)>, <9, (1, 7, 8)>, <9, (2, 7, 8)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 = 27

Therefore, there are a total of [27] 3-stars in your graph.
