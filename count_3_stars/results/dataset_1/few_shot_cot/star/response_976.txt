Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 5, and node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {6, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 6, 7, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-Stars: <2, (0, 6, 9)>, <2, (0, 7, 9)>, <2, (6, 7, 9)>, <2, (0, 6, 7)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {3} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {8, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 2} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 3, 5, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - 3-Stars: <9, (0, 2, 3)>, <9, (0, 2, 5)>, <9, (0, 2, 7)>, <9, (0, 3, 5)>, <9, (0, 3, 7)>, <9, (0, 5, 7)>, <9, (2, 3, 5)>, <9, (2, 3, 7)>, <9, (2, 5, 7)>, <9, (3, 5, 7)>
  
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 9: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 = 14
Therefore, there are a total of [14] 3-stars in your graph.
