Node 3 is connected to node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 7, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(C(3, 3) = 1\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <0, (1, 7, 8)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 5, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(C(4, 3) = 4\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <1, (0, 2, 7)>, <1, (0, 5, 7)>, <1, (2, 5, 7)>, <1, (0, 2, 5)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 6, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(C(3, 3) = 1\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <2, (1, 6, 7)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {6, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(C(3, 3) = 1\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <6, (2, 4, 7)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 9} (7 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(C(7, 3) = 35\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <7, (0, 1, 2)>, <7, (0, 8, 9)>, <7, (0, 6, 8)>, <7, (1, 2, 6)>, <7, (1, 5, 9)>, <7, (1, 2, 7)>, <7, (2, 6, 7)>, <7, (6, 8, 9)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 7, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(C(4, 3) = 4\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <8, (0, 7, 9)>, <8, (0, 4, 7)>, <8, (4, 7, 9)>, <8, (7, 8, 9)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(C(3, 3) = 1\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <9, (5, 7, 8)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 35
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 35 + 4 + 1 = 47
Therefore, there are a total of [47] 3-stars in your graph.
