Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 5, and node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Not connected to any other nodes.
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {3} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {6, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {6, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Not connected to any other nodes.
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Since no node has 3 or more neighbors, no 3-stars can be formed in this graph.

Therefore, there are a total of [0] 3-stars in your graph.
