Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list provided, we'll calculate the number of 3-star configurations possible for each relevant node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 7} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 5} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 5, 6} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 6} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6} (6 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 5} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 20
- From Node 6: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 20 + 1 = 23
Therefore, there are a total of [23] 3-stars in the provided graph.
