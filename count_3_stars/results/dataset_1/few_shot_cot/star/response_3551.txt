Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: No neighbors, cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 6, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {6} (1 neighbor), cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 8} (2 neighbors), cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1} (1 neighbor), cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {6, 8} (2 neighbors), cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 7**: No neighbors, cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 8} (2 neighbors), cannot form a 3-star.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 8: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6

Therefore, there are a total of [6] 3-stars in your graph.
