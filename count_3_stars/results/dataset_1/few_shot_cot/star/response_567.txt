Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 7, 8, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - 3-Stars: <0, (4, 5, 7)>, <0, (4, 5, 8)>, <0, (4, 7, 8)>, <0, (4, 7, 5)>, <0, (4, 7, 9)>, <0, (5, 7, 8)>, <0, (5, 7, 4)>, <0, (5, 7, 8)>, <0, (5, 8, 4)>, <0, (5, 8, 7)>

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {6} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-Stars: <4, (0, 1, 7)>

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 7, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-Stars: <5, (0, 7, 8)>

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {3} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-Stars: <7, (0, 4, 5)>

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-Stars: <8, (0, 2, 5)>

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 1
Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 14

Therefore, there are a total of [14] 3-stars in your graph.
