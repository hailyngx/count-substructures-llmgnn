Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 9
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 6

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: No neighbors
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 
  - <1, (4, 5, 9)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <2, (3, 4, 6)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <3, (2, 5, 6)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <4, (1, 2, 8)>, <4, (1, 2, 9)>, <4, (1, 8, 9)>, <4, (2, 8, 9)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <6, (2, 3, 9)>
- **Node 7**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <9, (1, 4, 6)>
  
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
- Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 8

Therefore, there are a total of [8] 3-stars in your graph.
