Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 5, 8} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 6, 7, 8} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3, 7} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2, 6} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 6, 9} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 5, 7, 8} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 4, 6} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 4, 6} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {4, 5} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 25

Therefore, there are a total of [25] 3-stars in your graph.
