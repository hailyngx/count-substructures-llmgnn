Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 5, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - <0, (3, 4, 5)>, <0, (3, 4, 8)>, <0, (4, 5, 8)>, <0, (3, 5, 8)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3, 6, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - <2, (3, 6, 9)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2, 7, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - <3, (0, 1, 2)>, <3, (0, 1, 7)>, <3, (0, 1, 8)>, <3, (0, 2, 7)>, <3, (0, 2, 8)>, <3, (0, 7, 8)>, <3, (1, 2, 7)>, <3, (1, 2, 8)>, <3, (1, 7, 8)>, <3, (2, 7, 8)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 5, 7, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - <4, (0, 5, 7)>, <4, (0, 5, 8)>, <4, (0, 7, 8)>, <4, (5, 7, 8)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - <5, (0, 4, 9)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {3, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - <8, (0, 3, 4)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - <9, (1, 2, 5)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Adding up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 22

Therefore, there are a total of [22] 3-stars in your graph.
