Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 4, and node 5

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {8, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 5, 6, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 4, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 2} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 3, 4, 5} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 = 24

Therefore, there are a total of [24] 3-stars in your graph.
