Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {6, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - Unique 3-stars:
    - <2, (3, 4, 5)>

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 4, 7, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
  - Unique 3-stars:
    - <3, (1, 2, 4)>
    - <3, (1, 4, 9)>
    - <3, (2, 4, 7)>
    - <3, (2, 7, 5)>
    - <3, (4, 7, 6)>
    - <3, (4, 9, 0)>
    - <3, (7, 5, 2)>
    - <3, (7, 6, 8)>
    - <3, (7, 9, 1)>
    - <3, (9, 0, 6)>

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - Unique 3-stars:
    - <4, (2, 3, 8)>
    - <4, (2, 8, 6)>
    - <4, (3, 8, 6)>
    - <4, (8, 6, 9)>

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 7, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - Unique 3-stars:
    - <6, (0, 7, 8)>
    - <6, (0, 8, 9)>
    - <6, (7, 8, 4)>
    - <6, (7, 9, 3)>

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - Unique 3-stars:
    - <7, (3, 5, 2)>
    
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - Unique 3-stars:
    - <8, (4, 6, 9)>

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 8} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3}\) = 20
  - Unique 3-stars:
    - <9, (0, 1, 3)>
    - <9, (0, 3, 4)>
    - <9, (0, 4, 8)>
    - <9, (0, 6, 7)>
    - <9, (0, 8, 6)>
    - <9, (1, 3, 4)>
    - <9, (1, 4, 8)>
    - <9, (3, 4, 8)>
    - <9, (3, 7, 5)>
    - <9, (3, 9, 0)>
    - <9, (4, 8, 6)>
    - <9, (4, 9, 0)>
    - <9, (6, 7, 3)>
    - <9, (6, 8, 4)>
    - <9, (7, 3, 1)>
    - <9, (8, 6, 7)>
    - <9, (8, 9, 1)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Total = 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 20 = 42

Therefore, there are a total of [42] 3-stars in your graph.
