Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 6

Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 5, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - <0, (3, 4, 5)>, <0, (3, 4, 6)>, <0, (3, 5, 6)>, <0, (4, 5, 6)>
  
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 6, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - <1, (2, 4, 6)>, <1, (2, 4, 9)>, <1, (2, 6, 9)>, <1, (4, 6, 9)>
  
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - <3, (0, 4, 5)>
  
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 3, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - <4, (0, 1, 3)>, <4, (0, 1, 6)>, <4, (0, 3, 6)>, <4, (1, 3, 6)>
  
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - <5, (0, 3, 6)>
  
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 4, 5, 7, 8} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
  - <6, (0, 1, 4)>, <6, (0, 1, 5)>, <6, (0, 1, 7)>, <6, (0, 1, 8)>, <6, (0, 4, 5)>, < 

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 20

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 20 = 34

Therefore, there are a total of [34] 3-stars in your graph.
