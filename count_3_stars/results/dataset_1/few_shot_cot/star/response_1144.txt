Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 9
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 4, 6, 7, 9} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
  - 3-Stars: <2, (0, 1, 4)>, <2, (0, 1, 6)>, <2, (0, 1, 7)>, <2, (0, 1, 9)>, <2, (0, 4, 6)>, <2, (0, 4, 7)>, <2, (0, 4, 9)>, <2, (0, 6, 7)>, <2, (0, 6, 9)>, <2, (0, 7, 9)>, <2, (1, 4, 6)>, <2, (1, 4, 7)>, <2, (1, 4, 9)>, <2, (1, 6, 7)>, <2, (1, 6, 9)>, <2, (1, 7, 9)>, <2, (4, 6, 7)>, <2, (4, 6, 9)>, <2, (4, 7, 9)>, <2, (6, 7, 9)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-Star: <4, (0, 1, 2)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-Star: <7, (2, 3, 9)>
- **Node 8**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-Star: <9, (2, 5, 7)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 2: 20
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 23

Therefore, there are a total of [23] 3-stars in your graph.
