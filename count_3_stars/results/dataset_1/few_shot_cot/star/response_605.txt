Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 6
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 6} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: No neighbors
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 6} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 5} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {4, 6} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 5, 7} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {6} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: No neighbors
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 9**: No neighbors
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 6: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 = 6

Therefore, there are a total of [6] 3-stars in your graph.
