Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 3

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list provided, we'll analyze each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <1, (2, 3, 8)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 5, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <2, (1, 5, 7)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 7, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <3, (1, 7, 9)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 4, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <5, (0, 2, 6)>, <5, (0, 4, 6)>, <5, (2, 4, 6)>, <5, (2, 6, 7)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <7, (2, 3, 8)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <8, (0, 1, 7)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {3} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 1 3-star
- From Node 2: 1 3-star
- From Node 3: 1 3-star
- From Node 5: 4 3-stars
- From Node 7: 1 3-star
- From Node 8: 1 3-star
Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 9

Therefore, there are a total of [9] 3-stars in your graph.
