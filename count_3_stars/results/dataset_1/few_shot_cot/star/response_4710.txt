Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 7, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 2} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2, 7, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 6**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 4, 7, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 9: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 13

Therefore, there are a total of [13] 3-stars in your graph.
