Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 9) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 3, 5, 6} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - <1, (0, 2, 3)> 
  - <1, (0, 2, 5)> 
  - <1, (0, 2, 6)> 
  - <1, (0, 3, 5)> 
  - <1, (0, 3, 6)> 
  - <1, (2, 3, 5)> 
  - <1, (2, 3, 6)> 
  - <1, (0, 2, 3)> 
  - <1, (0, 4, 5)> 
  - <1, (0, 5, 6)> 

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 5, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <2, (1, 3, 5)> 
  - <2, (1, 3, 6)> 
  - <2, (1, 5, 6)> 
  - <2, (3, 5, 6)> 

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 2} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 2} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 8**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 4
Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 4 = 15
Therefore, there are a total of [15] 3-stars in your graph.
