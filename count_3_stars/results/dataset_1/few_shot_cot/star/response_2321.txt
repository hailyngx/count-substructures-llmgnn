Node 9 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 5, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - 3-Stars: <0, (2, 3, 5)>, <0, (2, 3, 6)>, <0, (2, 5, 6)>, <0, (3, 5, 6)>
        
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 5, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - 3-Stars:  <1, (3, 4, 5)>, <1, (3, 4, 7)>, <1, (3, 5, 7)>, <1, (4, 5, 7)>

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
        
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - 3-Stars: <3, (0, 1, 2)>, <3, (0, 1, 9)>, <3, (0, 2, 9)>, <3, (1, 2, 9)>

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 6, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - 3-Stars: <4, (1, 6, 9)>

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 6, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - 3-Stars: <5, (0, 1, 6)>, <5, (0, 1, 8)>, <5, (0, 6, 8)>, <5, (1, 6, 8)>

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 5, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - 3-Stars: <6, (0, 4, 5)>, <6, (0, 4, 7)>, <6, (0, 5, 7)>, <6, (4, 5, 7)>

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - 3-Stars: <9, (3, 4, 8)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Adding up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 22

Therefore, there are a total of [22] 3-stars in your graph.
