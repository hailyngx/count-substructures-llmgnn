Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 6

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {9} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <2, (5, 6, 9)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 3, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <5, (0, 2, 6)>, <5, (0, 3, 6)>, <5, (2, 3, 6)>, <5, (0, 2, 3)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 5, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <6, (0, 2, 5)>, <6, (0, 5, 9)>, <6, (2, 5, 9)>, <6, (0, 2, 9)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {3, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <9, (1, 2, 6)>
  
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 10

Therefore, there are a total of [10] 3-stars in your graph.  
These are the unique 3-stars found: 
<2, (5, 6, 9)>, <5, (0, 2, 6)>, <5, (0, 3, 6)>, <5, (2, 3, 6)>, <5, (0, 2, 3)>, <6, (0, 2, 5)>, <6, (0, 5, 9)>, <6, (2, 5, 9)>, <6, (0, 2, 9)>, <9, (1, 2, 6)>
