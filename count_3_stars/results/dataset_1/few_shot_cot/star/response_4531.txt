Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 5

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 4, 5, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - Unique 3-stars: <2, (0, 4, 5)>, <2, (0, 4, 7)>, <2, (0, 5, 7)>, <2, (4, 5, 7)>, <2, (3, 4, 5)>, <2, (3, 4, 7)>, <2, (3, 5, 7)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 6, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Unique 3-star: <4, (2, 5, 9)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 4, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Unique 3-star: <5, (2, 4, 9)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {4, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 2} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {6} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {4, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 4 = 18

Therefore, there are a total of [18] 3-stars in your graph.
