Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 6} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 8} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {6} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 5, 7} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {6} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 9} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 8: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4

Therefore, there are a total of [4] 3-stars in your graph.
