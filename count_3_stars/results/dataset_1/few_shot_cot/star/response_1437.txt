Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - 3-star: <1, (2, 3, 7)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {6, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {4, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 4, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - 3-stars: <7, (1, 3, 4)>, <7, (1, 4, 8)>, <7, (3, 4, 8)>, <7, (1, 3, 8)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - 3-star: <8, (5, 6, 7)>
- **Node 9**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Adding up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 1
Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6

Therefore, there are a total of [6] 3-stars in your graph.
