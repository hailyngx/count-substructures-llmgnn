Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 6
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 6

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {3} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {7, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <2, (7, 8, 9)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <3, (0, 4, 7)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <4, (1, 3, 6)>
- **Node 5**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {4, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <7, (1, 2, 3)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {2, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 7: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4

Therefore, there are a total of [4] 3-stars in your graph.
