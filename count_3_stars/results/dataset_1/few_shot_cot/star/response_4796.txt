Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 0) (8, 4) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 0
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 1

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 5, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - <1, (2, 4, 5)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Not connected to any other nodes.
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 1} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Not connected to any other nodes.
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Total number of 3-stars = 4

Therefore, there are a total of [4] 3-stars in your graph.
