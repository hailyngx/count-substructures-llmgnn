Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {3, 8} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {6, 7} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {7, 8} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 7, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - 3-stars: <3, (0, 7, 9)>, <3, (0, 8, 9)>, <3, (7, 8, 9)>, <3, (0, 7, 8)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {6, 9} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 7, 9} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - 3-stars: <6, (1, 4, 9)>, <6, (1, 7, 9)>, <6, (4, 7, 9)>, <6, (1, 7, 4)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3, 5, 6} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
    - 3-stars: <7, (1, 2, 3)>, <7, (1, 2, 6)>, <7, (1, 3, 6)>, <7, (2, 3, 6)>, <7, (1, 2, 5)>, <7, (1, 5, 6)>, <7, (2, 5, 6)>, <7, (1, 3, 5)>, <7, (2, 3, 5)>, <7, (3, 5, 6)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 3} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - 3-star: <8, (0, 2, 3)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 6} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - 3-star: <9, (3, 4, 6)>
  
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 20

Therefore, there are a total of [20] 3-stars in your graph.
