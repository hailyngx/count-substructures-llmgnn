Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3, 5} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Possible 3-stars: <0, (1, 2, 3)>, <0, (1, 2, 5)>, <0, (1, 3, 5)>, <0, (2, 3, 5)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 4, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Possible 3-stars: <1, (0, 2, 4)>, <1, (0, 2, 8)>, <1, (0, 4, 8)>, <1, (2, 4, 8)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 5, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Possible 3-stars: <2, (0, 1, 5)>, <2, (0, 1, 8)>, <2, (0, 5, 8)>, <2, (1, 5, 8)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Possible 3-star: <5, (0, 2, 6)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Possible 3-stars: <8, (1, 2, 3)>, <8, (1, 2, 7)>, <8, (1, 3, 7)>, <8, (2, 3, 7)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {6} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 8: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 17

Therefore, there are a total of [17] 3-stars in your graph.
