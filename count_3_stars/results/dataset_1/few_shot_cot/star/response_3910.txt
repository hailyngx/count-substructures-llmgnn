Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 2) (8, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
        
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 6} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - 3-Star: <1, (2, 4, 6)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 3, 8} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - 3-Star: <2, (0, 1, 3)>, <2, (1, 3, 8)>, <2, (0, 3, 8)>, <2, (0, 1, 8)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 5, 6} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - 3-Star: <3, (2, 4, 5)>, <3, (2, 4, 6)>, <3, (2, 5, 6)>, <3, (4, 5, 6)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 5} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - 3-Star: <4, (1, 3, 5)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {3, 4} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 8} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - 3-Star: <6, (1, 3, 8)>
- **Node 7**: No neighbors
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2, 6} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: No neighbors
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
        
Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 11

Therefore, there are a total of [11] 3-stars in your graph.
