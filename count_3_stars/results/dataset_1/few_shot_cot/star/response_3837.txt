Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Not connected to any nodes.
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 5, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <2, (0, 5, 7)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {3, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <4, (3, 8, 9)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Not connected to any nodes.
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 7, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <8, (0, 4, 9)>, <8, (0, 7, 9)>, <8, (4, 7, 9)>, <8, (0, 4, 7)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <9, (4, 5, 8)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 2: 1 3-star
- From Node 4: 1 3-star
- From Node 8: 4 3-stars
- From Node 9: 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 7

Therefore, there are a total of [7] 3-stars in your graph.
