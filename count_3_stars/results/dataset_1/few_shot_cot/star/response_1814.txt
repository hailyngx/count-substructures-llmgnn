Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 9
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, 7, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 2**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 5, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {3, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 4, 8, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 7, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 6, 7, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 20
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 3: 20
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 1 + 20 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 70

Therefore, there are a total of [70] 3-stars in your graph.
