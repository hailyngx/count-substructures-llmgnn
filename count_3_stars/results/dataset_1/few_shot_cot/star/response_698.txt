Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 4, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 4, 5, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2, 3} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 6**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Adding up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 21

Therefore, there are a total of [21] 3-stars in your graph.
