Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-star: <1, (5, 6, 8)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {2, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 6, 7, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - Unique 3-star: <5, (0, 1, 6)>, <5, (0, 1, 7)>, <5, (0, 6, 7)>, <5, (1, 6, 7)>, <5, (1, 6, 8)>, <5, (1, 7, 8)>, <5, (6, 7, 8)>, <5, (0, 6, 8)>, <5, (0, 7, 8)>, <5, (6, 7, 8)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 5, 7, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-star: <6, (1, 5, 7)>, <6, (1, 5, 8)>, <6, (1, 7, 8)>, <6, (5, 7, 8)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-star: <7, (5, 6, 8)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 5, 6, 7, 9} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
  - Unique 3-star: <8, (0, 1, 5)>, <8, (0, 1, 6)>, <8, (0, 1, 7)>, <8, (0, 1, 9)>, <8, (0, 5, 6)>, <8, (0, 5, 7)>, <8, (0, 5, 9)>, <8, (0, 6, 7)>, <8, (0, 6, 9)>, <8, (0, 7, 9)>, <8, (1, 5, 6)>, <8, (1, 5, 7)>, <8, (1, 5, 9)>, <8, (1, 6, 7)>, <8, (1, 6, 9)>, <8, (1, 7, 9)>, <8, (5, 6, 7)>, <8, (5, 6, 9)>, <8, (5, 7, 9)>, <8, (6, 7, 9)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {4, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 20

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 20 = 36

Therefore, there are a total of [36] 3-stars in your graph.
