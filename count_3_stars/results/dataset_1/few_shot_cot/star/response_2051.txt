Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 5, 6} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - 3-stars: <0, (2, 4, 5)>, <0, (2, 4, 6)>, <0, (2, 5, 6)>, <0, (4, 5, 6)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 6} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 7} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: No neighbors
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 6, 8} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - 3-stars: <4, (0, 1, 6)>, <4, (0, 6, 8)>, <4, (1, 6, 8)>, <4, (0, 1, 8)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 6, 9} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - 3-stars: <5, (0, 6, 9)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 4, 5, 7} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
    - 3-stars: <6, (0, 1, 4)>, <6, (0, 1, 7)>, <6, (0, 4, 5)>, <6, (0, 4, 7)>, <6, (0, 5, 7)>, <6, (1, 4, 5)>, <6, (1, 4, 7)>, <6, (1, 5, 7)>, <6, (4, 5, 7)>, <6, (0, 5, 9)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2, 6} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
    
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 = 19

Therefore, there are a total of [19] 3-stars in your graph.
