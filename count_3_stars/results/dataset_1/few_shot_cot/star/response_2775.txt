Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will calculate the number of unique 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \), where \( n \) is the number of neighbors.

Let's calculate the 3-stars for each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 8} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
    - Unique 3-star: <0, (1, 4, 8)>
  
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 6, 7, 9} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    - Unique 3-star: <1, (0, 6, 9)>, <1, (2, 7, 9)>
  
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 5, 6, 7} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - Unique 3-star: <2, (1, 6, 7)>
  
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {7, 9} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 5, 8} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
    - Unique 3-star: <4, (0, 5, 8)>
  
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 6, 8} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - Unique 3-star: <5, (2, 6, 8)>
  
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 5, 7, 8} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    - Unique 3-star: <6, (1, 2, 7)>, <6, (1, 5, 8)>, <6, (2, 7, 8)>, <6, (5, 7, 8)>
  
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3, 6, 9} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    - Unique 3-star: <7, (1, 3, 9)>, <7, (2, 6, 9)>
  
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 5, 6, 9} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    - Unique 3-star: <8, (0, 5, 9)>, <8, (4, 6, 9)>
  
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 7, 8} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - Unique 3-star: <9, (1, 7, 8)>
  
Summing up the total number of 3-stars:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 20
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 20 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 64

Therefore, there are a total of [64] 3-stars in your graph.
