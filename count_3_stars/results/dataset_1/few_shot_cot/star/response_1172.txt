Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {9} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 5, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <1, (2, 4, 5)>, <1, (2, 4, 6)>, <1, (2, 5, 6)>, <1, (4, 5, 6)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {6} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 5, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <4, (1, 5, 7)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 6, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <5, (1, 4, 6)>, <5, (1, 4, 8)>, <5, (1, 6, 8)>, <5, (4, 6, 8)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 5, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <6, (1, 5, 7)>, <6, (1, 5, 3)>, <6, (1, 7, 3)>, <6, (5, 7, 3)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <7, (4, 6, 8)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <8, (2, 5, 7)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 16

Therefore, there are a total of [16] 3-stars in your graph.
