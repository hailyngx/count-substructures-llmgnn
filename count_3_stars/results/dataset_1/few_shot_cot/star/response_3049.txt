Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 6, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 2} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 4, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {4, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 10
Therefore, there are a total of [10] 3-stars in your graph.
