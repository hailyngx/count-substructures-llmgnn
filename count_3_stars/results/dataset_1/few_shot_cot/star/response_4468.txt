Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 7, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 8} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 8} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 6} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {2, 8} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9} (7 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{7}{3}\) = 35
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {7, 8} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 35

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 35 = 37

Therefore, there are a total of [37] 3-stars in your graph.
