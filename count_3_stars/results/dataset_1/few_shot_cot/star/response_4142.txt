Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 4, 6, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - 3-Stars:  <1, (0, 3, 4)>, <1, (0, 3, 6)>, <1, (0, 3, 7)>, <1, (0, 4, 6)>, <1, (0, 4, 7)>, <1, (0, 6, 7)>, <1, (3, 4, 6)>, <1, (3, 4, 7)>, <1, (3, 6, 7)>, <1, (4, 6, 7)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - 3-Stars: <6, (1, 3, 9)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - 3-Stars: <7, (0, 1, 8)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 5, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - 3-Stars: <8, (2, 4, 5)>, <8, (2, 4, 7)>, <8, (2, 5, 7)>, <8, (4, 5, 7)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {6} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 16

Therefore, there are a total of [16] 3-stars in your graph.
