Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 2} (2 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{2}{3}\) = 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 5, 6, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
  - 3-Stars: <0, (3, 5, 6)>, <0, (3, 5, 9)>, <0, (3, 6, 9)>, <0, (5, 6, 9)>, <1, (0, 5, 6)>, <1, (0, 5, 9)>, <1, (0, 6, 9)>, <1, (5, 6, 9)>, <2, (5, 6, 9)>, <3, (0, 5, 6)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{2}{3}\) = 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{2}{3}\) = 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{2}{3}\) = 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 4, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - 3-Stars: <1, (2, 4, 6)>, <1, (4, 6, 9)>, <5, (2, 4, 6)>, <5, (4, 6, 9)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 5, 7, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - 3-Stars: <1, (5, 7, 8)>, <1, (5, 6, 8)>, <5, (1, 7, 8)>, <5, (1, 6, 8)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{2}{3}\) = 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {6, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{2}{3}\) = 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - 3-Stars: <1, (3, 8, 9)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 19

Therefore, there are a total of [19] 3-stars in your graph.
