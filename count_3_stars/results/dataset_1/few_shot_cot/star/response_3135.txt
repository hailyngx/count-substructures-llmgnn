Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 3

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 8} (2 neighbors)  
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.  
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 7} (3 neighbors)  
  Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 6} (2 neighbors)  
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.  
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 7, 9} (3 neighbors)  
  Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 5, 7} (3 neighbors)  
  Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {4, 8} (2 neighbors)  
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.  
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)  
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.  
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 4, 8} (4 neighbors)  
  Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 5, 7} (3 neighbors)  
  Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {3} (1 neighbor)  
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.  

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars  
Add up all the valid configurations:  
- From Node 1: 1  
- From Node 3: 1  
- From Node 4: 1  
- From Node 7: 4  
- From Node 8: 1  

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 8  

Therefore, there are a total of [8] 3-stars in your graph.
