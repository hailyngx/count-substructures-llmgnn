Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 5
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - 3-star: <0, (4, 6, 7)>

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - 3-star: <1, (2, 4, 8)>

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - 3-star: <3, (4, 6, 7)>

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 3, 5, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - 3-stars: 
    - <4, (0, 1, 3)>
    - <4, (0, 1, 5)>
    - <4, (0, 1, 8)>
    - <4, (0, 3, 5)>
    - <4, (0, 3, 8)>
    - <4, (0, 5, 8)>
    - <4, (1, 3, 5)>
    - <4, (1, 3, 8)>
    - <4, (1, 5, 8)>
    - <4, (3, 5, 8)>

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - 3-star: <5, (4, 7, 8)>

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - 3-star: <7, (0, 3, 5)>

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 4, 5} (4 neighbors)
   - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   - 3-stars:
     - <8, (1, 2, 4)>
     - <8, (1, 2, 5)>
     - <8, (1, 4, 5)>
     - <8, (2, 4, 5)>

- **Node 9**: No neighbors. Cannot form a 3-star.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Counting the unique 3-star configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 19

Therefore, there are a total of [19] 3-stars in your graph.
