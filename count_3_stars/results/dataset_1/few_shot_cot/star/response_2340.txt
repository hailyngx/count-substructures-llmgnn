Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list provided, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each applicable node:
- **Node 0**: No neighbors, cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 6, 7, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 5, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 4, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 5, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 6, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 7, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Adding up the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 18

Therefore, there are a total of [18] 3-stars in your graph.
