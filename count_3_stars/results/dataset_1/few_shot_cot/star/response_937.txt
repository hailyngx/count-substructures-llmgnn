Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 5, 6, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 3, 5, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {7, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 5: 20
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 1 + 20 + 1 + 10 = 43

Therefore, there are a total of [43] 3-stars in your graph.
