Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: No neighbors
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 7, 8} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - <1, (5, 6, 7)>
    - <1, (5, 6, 8)>
    - <1, (5, 7, 8)>
    - <1, (6, 7, 8)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3, 6, 7} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - <2, (3, 6, 7)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2, 6, 7} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - <3, (2, 6, 7)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 9} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 7} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - <5, (1, 4, 7)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - <6, (1, 2, 3)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3, 5} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - <7, (1, 2, 3)>
    - <7, (1, 2, 5)>
    - <7, (1, 3, 5)>
    - <7, (2, 3, 5)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 9} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {4, 8} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 12

Therefore, there are a total of [12] 3-stars in your graph.
