Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 7, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {6, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 7, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {3} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2, 4} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 4, 5, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 20

Therefore, there are a total of [20] 3-stars in your graph.
