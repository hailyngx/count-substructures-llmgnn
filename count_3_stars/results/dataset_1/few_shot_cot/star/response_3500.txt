Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {6, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 4, 5, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - Unique 3-stars:
    - From Node 2: <2, (0, 3, 4)>, <2, (0, 3, 5)>, <2, (0, 3, 7)>, <2, (3, 4, 5)>, <2, (3, 4, 7)>, <2, (3, 5, 7)>, <2, (4, 5, 7)>, <2, (0, 4, 5)>, <2, (0, 4, 7)>, <2, (0, 5, 7)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-stars:
    - From Node 3: <3, (2, 4, 6)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 5, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-stars:
    - From Node 4: <4, (2, 3, 5)>, <4, (2, 3, 9)>, <4, (2, 5, 9)>, <4, (3, 5, 9)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-stars:
    - From Node 5: <5, (2, 4, 7)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-stars:
    - From Node 7: <7, (2, 5, 9)>
- **Node 8**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-stars:
    - From Node 9: <9, (1, 4, 7)>
  
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 18

Therefore, there are a total of [18] 3-stars in the given graph.
