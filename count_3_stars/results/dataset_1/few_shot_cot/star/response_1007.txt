Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 2

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 5, 6, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-stars:
    - <0, (1, 5, 6)>
    - <0, (1, 6, 9)>
    - <0, (5, 6, 9)>
    - <0, (1, 5, 9)>
  
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-star:
    - <1, (0, 4, 6)>
  
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {6, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-star:
    - <5, (0, 3, 7)>
    
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2, 4, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - 3-stars:
    - <6, (0, 1, 4)>
    - <6, (0, 1, 7)>
    - <6, (0, 2, 4)>
    - <6, (0, 2, 7)>
    - <6, (0, 4, 7)>
    - <6, (1, 4, 7)>
    - <6, (0, 1, 2)>
    - <6, (1, 2, 4)>
    - <6, (1, 2, 7)>
    - <6, (2, 4, 7)>
  
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 8**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 2} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 16

Therefore, there are a total of [16] 3-stars in your graph.
