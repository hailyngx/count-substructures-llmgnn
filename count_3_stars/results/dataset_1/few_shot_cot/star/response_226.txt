Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - <1, (4, 5, 6)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 5, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - <2, (0, 3, 8)>, <2, (0, 5, 8)>, <2, (3, 5, 8)>, <2, (0, 3, 5)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 7, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - <4, (1, 7, 9)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2, 7, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
  - <5, (0, 1, 2)>, <5, (0, 2, 8)>, <5, (1, 2, 8)>, <5, (0, 1, 8)>, <5, (2, 7, 8)>, <5, (0, 7, 8)>, <5, (1, 7, 8)>, <5, (0, 1, 7)>, <5, (1, 2, 7)>, <5, (0, 2, 7)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - <7, (4, 5, 8)>, <7, (4, 5, 9)>, <7, (5, 8, 9)>, <7, (4, 8, 9)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 5, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - <8, (2, 3, 5)>, <8, (2, 5, 7)>, <8, (3, 5, 7)>, <8, (2, 3, 7)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - <9, (4, 6, 7)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 25

Therefore, there are a total of [25] 3-stars in your graph.
