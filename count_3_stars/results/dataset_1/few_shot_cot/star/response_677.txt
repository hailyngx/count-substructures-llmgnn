Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 6

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list provided, we'll analyze each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 6, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {8, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 5, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3

Therefore, there are a total of [3] 3-stars in your graph.
