Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <2, (4, 8, 9)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 7, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <4, (0, 7, 8)>, <4, (2, 7, 8)>, <4, (7, 8, 9)>, <4, (0, 2, 8)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <5, (1, 3, 6)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <6, (5, 7, 9)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <8, (2, 4, 9)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {2, 6, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <9, (2, 6, 8)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 9

Therefore, there are a total of [9] 3-stars in your graph.
