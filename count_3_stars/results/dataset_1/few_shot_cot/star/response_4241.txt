Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 8
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 8

Response:
Given the graph and adjacency list provided, let's calculate the number of 3-stars present:

**Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:**
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 
  - 3-star: <0, (4, 6, 9)>

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 2**: Not connected to any nodes.
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.

- **Node 3**: Not connected to any nodes.
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {4, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {9} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 5, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 
  - 3-star: <8, (1, 5, 9)>

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 7, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 
  - 3-star: <9, (0, 7, 8)>

**Total Number of 3-Stars:**
Adding up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1 
- From Node 8: 1 
- From Node 9: 1 

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in your graph is 3. Therefore, the answer is [3].
