Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 3

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 6, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 6, 7, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {4, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 11
Therefore, there are a total of [11] 3-stars in your graph.
