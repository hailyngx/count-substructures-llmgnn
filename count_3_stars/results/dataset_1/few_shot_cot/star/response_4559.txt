Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <1, (0, 8, 9)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {6, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {9} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {3, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {3, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <7, (3, 8, 9)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 7, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <8, (1, 7, 9)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
  - <9, (1, 8, 7)>, <9, (1, 8, 2)>, <9, (1, 7, 8)>, <9, (1, 7, 5)>, <9, (1, 7, 3)>, <9, (1, 7, 9)>, <9, (1, 7, 8)>, <9, (1, 9, 7)>, <9, (1, 9, 8)>, <9, (1, 9, 2)>, <9, (8, 1, 7)>, <9, (8, 1, 9)>, <9, (8, 1, 2)>, <9, (8, 7, 1)>, <9, (8, 7, 3)>, <9, (8, 7, 9)>, <9, (8, 7, 1)>, <9, (8, 9, 1)>, <9, (8, 9, 7)>, <9, (8, 9, 1)>
  
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8; 1
- From Node 9: 20
Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 20 = 23

Therefore, there are a total of [23] 3-stars in your graph.
