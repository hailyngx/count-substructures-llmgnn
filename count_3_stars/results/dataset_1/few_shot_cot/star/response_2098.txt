Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 4

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 4} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: No neighbors
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 3} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2, 7, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 5, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {7, 8} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {3, 6, 8} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 6, 7} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {3, 4} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 13

Therefore, there are a total of [13] 3-stars in your graph. This count represents how many unique 3-star subgraphs can be formed based on the adjacency list provided.
