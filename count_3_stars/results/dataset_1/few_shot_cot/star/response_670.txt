Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 0

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {6} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {4, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 2} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
There are no nodes with 3 or more neighbors to form a 3-star in this graph.
Therefore, there are no 3-stars in this graph.
The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [0].
