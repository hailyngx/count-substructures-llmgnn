Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 5

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: No neighbors.
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-star: <2, (4, 7, 9)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 5, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-star: <3, (1, 5, 6)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-star: <4, (2, 5, 9)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-stars: <5, (3, 4, 8)>, <5, (3, 4, 9)>, <5, (3, 8, 9)>, <5, (4, 8, 9)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-star: <6, (1, 3, 8)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-star: <8, (5, 6, 7)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-star: <9, (2, 4, 5)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 10

Therefore, there are a total of [10] 3-stars in your graph.
