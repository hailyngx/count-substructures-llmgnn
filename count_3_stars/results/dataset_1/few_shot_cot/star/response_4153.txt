Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 4

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 5, 6, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <1, (0, 5, 6)>, <1, (0, 5, 7)>, <1, (0, 6, 7)>, <1, (5, 6, 7)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <2, (4, 5, 8)>, <2, (4, 5, 9)>, <2, (4, 8, 9)>, <2, (5, 8, 9)>
- **Node 3**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {2, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-star: <4, (2, 8, 9)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-star: <5, (1, 2, 7)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {2, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Adding up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 10

Therefore, there are a total of [10] 3-stars in your graph.
