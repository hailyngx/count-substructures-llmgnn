Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
        Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
        - **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1} (1 neighbor)
        - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
        - **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 4, 6} (4 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
        - **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3, 9} (2 neighbors)
        - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
        - **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 5, 8} (4 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
        - **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 7, 9} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
        - **Node 5**: Neighbors = {3, 8} (2 neighbors)
        - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
        - **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 9} (2 neighbors)
        - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
        - **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 9} (2 neighbors)
        - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
        - **Node 8**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 9} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
        - **Node 9**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 6, 7, 8} (5 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

        Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
        Add up all the valid configurations:
        - From Node 1: 4
        - From Node 3: 4
        - From Node 4: 1
        - From Node 8: 1
        - From Node 9: 10
        Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 20
        Therefore, there are a total of [20] 3-stars in your graph.
