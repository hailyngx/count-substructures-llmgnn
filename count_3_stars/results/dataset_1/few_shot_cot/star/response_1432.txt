Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - 3-stars: <0, (1, 3, 8)>, <0, (1, 3, 9)>, <0, (1, 8, 9)>, <0, (3, 8, 9)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 7} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - 3-star: <1, (0, 2, 7)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 7} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 6, 9} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - 3-star: <3, (0, 6, 9)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - 3-stars: <4, (5, 6, 8)>, <4, (5, 6, 9)>, <4, (5, 8, 9)>, <4, (6, 8, 9)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 7, 8} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - 3-stars: <5, (4, 6, 7)>, <5, (4, 6, 8)>, <5, (4, 7, 8)>, <5, (6, 7, 8)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 5, 7, 8} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
    - 3-stars: <6, (3, 4, 5)>, <6, (3, 4, 7)>, <6, (3, 4, 8)>, <6, (3, 5, 7)>, <6, (3, 5, 8)>, <6, (3, 7, 8)>, <6, (4, 5, 7)>, <6, (4, 5, 8)>, <6, (4, 7, 8)>, <6, (5, 7, 8)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 5, 6, 8} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
    - 3-stars: <7, (1, 2, 5)>, <7, (1, 2, 6)>, <7, (1, 2, 8)>, <7, (1, 5, 6)>, <7, (1, 5, 8)>, <7, (1, 6, 8)>, <7, (2, 5, 6)>, <7, (2, 5, 8)>, <7, (2, 6, 8)>, <7, (5, 6, 8)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 5, 6, 7} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
    - 3-stars: <8, (0, 4, 5)>, <8, (0, 4, 6)>, <8, (0, 4, 7)>, <8, (0, 5, 6)>, <8, (0, 5, 7)>, <8, (0, 6, 7)>, <8, (4, 5, 6)>, <8, (4, 5, 7)>, <8, (4, 6, 7)>, <8, (5, 6, 7)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 4} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - 3-star: <9, (0, 3, 4)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 = 45

Therefore, there are a total of [45] 3-stars in your graph.
