Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (2, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 6

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-star: <4, (3, 5, 7)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-star: <5, (0, 4, 9)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {7, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-star: <6, (7, 8, 9)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {6} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-star: <9, (3, 5, 6)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4

Therefore, there are a total of [4] 3-stars in your graph.
