Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 6, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {3, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 6, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 4, 6, 8, 9} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {3, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 4, 6, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Adding up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 3: 20
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 9: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 20 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 36

Therefore, there are a total of [36] 3-stars in your graph.
