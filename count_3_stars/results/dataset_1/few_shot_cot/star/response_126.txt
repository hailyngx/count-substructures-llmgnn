Response:
Calculation of Number of 3-Stars in the Given Graph:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {6} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - 3-Stars: <1, (2, 4, 8)>, <1, (2, 4, 9)>, <1, (2, 8, 9)>, <1, (4, 8, 9)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
  - 3-Stars: <2, (1, 3, 5)>, <2, (1, 3, 6)>, <2, (1, 3, 7)>, <2, (1, 3, 9)>, <2, (1, 5, 6)>, <2, (1, 5, 7)>, <2, (1, 5, 9)>, <2, (1, 6, 7)>, <2, (1, 6, 9)>, <2, (1, 7, 9)>, <2, (3, 5, 6)>, <2, (3, 5, 7)>, <2, (3, 5, 9)>, <2, (3, 6, 7)>, <2, (3, 6, 9)>, <2, (3, 7, 9)>, <2, (5, 6, 7)>, <2, (5, 6, 9)>, <2, (5, 7, 9)>, <2, (6, 7, 9)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2, 7, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - 3-Stars: <3, (2, 7, 8)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2, 6, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - 3-Stars: <5, (2, 6, 7)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 5, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - 3-Stars: <6, (0, 2, 5)>, <6, (0, 2, 7)>, <6, (0, 5, 7)>, <6, (2, 5, 7)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 5, 6, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - 3-Stars: <7, (2, 3, 5)>, <7, (2, 3, 6)>, <7, (2, 3, 9)>, <7, (2, 5, 6)>, <7, (2, 5, 9)>, <7, (2, 6, 9)>, <7, (3, 5, 6)>, <7, (3, 5, 9)>, <7, (3, 6, 9)>, <7, (5, 6, 9)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 4, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - 3-Stars: <8, (1, 3, 4)>, <8, (1, 3, 9)>, <8, (1, 4, 9)>, <8, (3, 4, 9)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 7, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - 3-Stars: <9, (1, 2, 7)>, <9, (1, 2, 8)>, <9, (1, 7, 8)>, <9, (2, 7, 8)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 20 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 44

Therefore, there are a total of [44] 3-stars in your graph.
