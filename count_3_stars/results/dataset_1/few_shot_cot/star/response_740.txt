Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 3

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list provided, we'll analyze each node:
- **Node 0**: No neighbors, hence cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 6, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Possible 3-stars:
    - <1, (2, 3, 6)>
    - <1, (2, 3, 8)>
    - <1, (2, 6, 8)>
    - <1, (3, 6, 8)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: No neighbors, hence cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {6, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 5, 7, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Possible 3-stars:
    - <6, (1, 5, 8)>
    - <6, (1, 7, 8)>
    - <6, (5, 7, 8)>
    - <6, (1, 5, 7)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {6} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 5, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Possible 3-stars:
    - <8, (1, 2, 5)>
    - <8, (1, 2, 6)>
    - <8, (1, 5, 6)>
    - <8, (2, 5, 6)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {3} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Counting the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 8: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 = 12

Therefore, there are a total of [12] 3-stars in your graph.
