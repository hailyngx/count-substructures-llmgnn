Node 3 is connected to node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 4

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 5, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <0, (2, 4, 5)>, <0, (2, 4, 7)>, <0, (2, 5, 7)>, <0, (4, 5, 7)>
  
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <2, (0, 4, 7)>

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {9} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2, 6, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - <4, (0, 1, 2)>, <4, (0, 2, 6)>, <4, (0, 2, 9)>, <4, (0, 6, 9)>, <4, (1, 2, 6)>, <4, (1, 2, 9)>, <4, (1, 6, 9)>, <4, (2, 6, 9)>, <4, (0, 1, 9)>, <4, (1, 2, 9)>

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 6, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <5, (0, 6, 7)>

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <6, (4, 5, 7)>

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2, 5, 6} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - <7, (0, 1, 2)>, <7, (0, 1, 5)>, <7, (0, 2, 5)>, <7, (0, 5, 6)>, <7, (1, 2, 5)>, <7, (1, 5, 6)>, <7, (2, 5, 6)>, <7, (0, 1, 6)>, <7, (1, 5, 6)>, <7, (2, 5, 6)>

- **Node 8**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {3, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Adding up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 10
Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 27

Therefore, there are a total of [27] 3-stars in your graph.
