Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 4, 6, and node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {3, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 5, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <2, (3, 5, 6)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <3, (0, 1, 2)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2, 6, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <4, (0, 2, 6)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2, 6, 7, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <5, (6, 7, 8)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <6, (2, 5, 7)>, <6, (2, 5, 8)>, <6, (2, 7, 8)>, <6, (5, 7, 8)>, <6, (7, 8, 9)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <7, (5, 8, 9)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 6, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <9, (3, 4, 6)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 = 50

Therefore, there are a total of [50] 3-stars in your graph.
