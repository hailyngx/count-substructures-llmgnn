Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 6

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 4, 5, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 6, 7, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 4, 8, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {2, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 5, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 33

Therefore, there are a total of [33] 3-stars in your graph.
