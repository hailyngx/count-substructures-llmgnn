Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 5, 6, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {7, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 5, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 3, 6, 7, 9} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 20
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 20 + 1 = 34

Therefore, there are a total of [34] 3-stars in your graph.
