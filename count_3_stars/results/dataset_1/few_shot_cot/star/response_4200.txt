Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 8

Response:
Computation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {3} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3, 6, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 6, 8, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 15

Therefore, there are a total of [15] 3-stars in the given graph.
