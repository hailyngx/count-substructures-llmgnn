Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 5

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 4} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 9} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8} (7 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{7}{3} = 35\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {4, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {4, 7} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 6} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 5} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 5} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 35
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 35 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 39

Therefore, there are a total of [39] 3-stars in your graph.
