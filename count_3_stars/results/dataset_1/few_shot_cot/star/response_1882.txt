Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 6, 7, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {6, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {3, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-Star: <8, (0, 2, 9)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {3, 6, 7, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-Stars: <9, (3, 6, 7)>, <9, (3, 6, 8)>, <9, (3, 7, 8)>, <9, (6, 7, 8)>
  
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
From the valid configurations:
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 = 5

Therefore, there are a total of [5] 3-stars in your graph.
