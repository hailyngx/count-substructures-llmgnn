Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {7, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 7, 8, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - <2, (3, 5, 9)>, <2, (5, 7, 8)>, <2, (5, 7, 9)>, <2, (5, 8, 9)>, <2, (7, 8, 9)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <3, (2, 8, 9)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {3} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 7, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <7, (0, 2, 5)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 3, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <9, (2, 5, 8)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Total number of 3-stars = 10 (from Node 2) + 1 (from Node 3) + 1 (from Node 7) + 1 (from Node 9) = 13

Therefore, there are a total of [13] 3-stars in your graph.
