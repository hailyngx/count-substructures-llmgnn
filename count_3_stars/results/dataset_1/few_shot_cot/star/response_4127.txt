Node 4 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node 
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 7, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Possible 3-stars: <3, (2, 5, 7)>, <3, (2, 5, 8)>, <3, (2, 7, 8)>, <3, (5, 7, 8)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 7, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Possible 3-star: <4, (0, 7, 9)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Possible 3-star: <5, (1, 3, 8)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {7, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 6, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Possible 3-stars: <7, (3, 4, 8)>, <7, (3, 6, 8)>, <7, (4, 6, 8)>, <7, (3, 4, 6)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 6, 7, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - Possible 3-stars: <8, (3, 5, 7)>, <8, (3, 5, 9)>, <8, (3, 6, 7)>, <8, (3, 6, 9)>, <8, (3, 7, 9)>, <8, (5, 6, 7)>, <8, (5, 6, 9)>, <8, (5, 7, 9)>, <8, (6, 7, 9)>, <8, (3, 7, 9)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 4, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Possible 3-stars: <9, (1, 2, 8)>, <9, (1, 4, 8)>, <9, (2, 4, 8)>, <9, (1, 2, 4)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 24

Therefore, there are a total of [24] 3-stars in your graph.
