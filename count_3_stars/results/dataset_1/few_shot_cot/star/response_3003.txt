Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 5, and node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {3, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Possible 3-star: <1, (5, 6, 9)>
- **Node 2**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {6, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 7, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Possible 3-star: <5, (1, 7, 9)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Possible 3-star: <6, (1, 4, 7)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Possible 3-star: <7, (5, 6, 9)>
- **Node 8**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 4, 5, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - Possible 3-star: <9, (0, 1, 4)>, <9, (0, 1, 5)>, <9, (0, 1, 7)>, <9, (1, 4, 5)>, <9, (1, 4, 7)>, <9, (1, 5, 7)>, <9, (4, 5, 7)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 9: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 14

Therefore, there are a total of [14] 3-stars in your graph.
