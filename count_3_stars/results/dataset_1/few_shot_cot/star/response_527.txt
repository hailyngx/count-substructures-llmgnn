Node 5 is connected to node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 3

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:

- **Node 0**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
  
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Unique 3-star: <1, (2, 5, 6)>
  
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 7, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Unique 3-star: <2, (1, 7, 9)>
  
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {6, 7, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Unique 3-stars: 
    - <3, (6, 7, 8)>
    - <3, (6, 7, 9)>
    - <3, (6, 8, 9)>
    - <3, (7, 8, 9)>
  
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {6, 7, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Unique 3-star: <4, (6, 7, 8)>
  
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Unique 3-star: <6, (1, 3, 4)>
  
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Unique 3-star: <7, (2, 3, 4)>
  
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {3, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {2, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 9

Therefore, there are a total of [9] 3-stars in your graph.
