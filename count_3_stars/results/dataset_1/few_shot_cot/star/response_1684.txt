Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbor = {4} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbor = {0} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 5, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-Star: <4, (1, 5, 6)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 7, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-Stars: <5, (3, 4, 7)>, <5, (3, 4, 9)>, <5, (4, 7, 9)>, <5, (3, 7, 9)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-Stars: <6, (4, 7, 8)>, <6, (4, 7, 9)>, <6, (4, 8, 9)>, <6, (7, 8, 9)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-Stars: <7, (5, 6, 8)>, <7, (5, 6, 9)>, <7, (5, 8, 9)>, <7, (6, 8, 9)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {6, 7, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-Star: <8, (6, 7, 9)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 7, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-Stars: <9, (5, 6, 7)>, <9, (5, 6, 8)>, <9, (5, 7, 8)>, <9, (6, 7, 8)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 4
Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 18

Therefore, there are a total of [18] 3-stars in your graph.
