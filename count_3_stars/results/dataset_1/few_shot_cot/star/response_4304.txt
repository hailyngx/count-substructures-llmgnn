Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 6

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 6, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-Stars: <2, (1, 3, 6)>, <2, (1, 3, 7)>, <2, (1, 6, 7)>, <2, (3, 6, 7)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2, 6, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-Stars: <3, (2, 6, 9)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-Stars: <4, (5, 6, 8)>, <4, (5, 6, 9)>, <4, (5, 8, 9)>, <4, (6, 8, 9)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-Stars: <5, (4, 7, 8)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 4, 7, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - 3-Stars: <6, (2, 3, 4)>, <6, (2, 3, 7)>, <6, (2, 3, 9)>, <6, (2, 4, 7)>, <6, (2, 4, 9)>, <6, (2, 7, 9)>, <6, (3, 4, 7)>, <6, (3, 4, 9)>, <6, (3, 7, 9)>, <6, (4, 7, 9)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 5, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-Stars: <7, (0, 2, 5)>, <7, (0, 2, 6)>, <7, (0, 5, 6)>, <7, (2, 5, 6)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 4, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-Stars: <9, (1, 3, 4)>, <9, (1, 3, 6)>, <9, (1, 4, 6)>, <9, (3, 4, 6)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 28

Therefore, there are a total of [28] 3-stars in your graph.
