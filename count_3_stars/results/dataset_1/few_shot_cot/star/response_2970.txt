Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (2, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 3) (8, 6) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 2} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {6, 7} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {4, 9} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {3, 8} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {3} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {6} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Since all nodes with 3 or more neighbors cannot form a 3-star in this graph, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 0.
Therefore, there are a total of [0] 3-stars in your graph.
