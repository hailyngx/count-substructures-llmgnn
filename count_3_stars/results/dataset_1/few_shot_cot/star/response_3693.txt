Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - 3-star: <0, (1, 3, 6)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
  - 3-stars: 
    - <1, (0, 6, 7)>
    - <1, (0, 6, 8)>
    - <1, (2, 4, 6)>
    - <1, (2, 6, 7)>
    - <1, (2, 6, 8)>
    - <1, (4, 6, 7)>
    - <1, (4, 6, 8)>
    - <1, (6, 7, 8)>
    - <1, (0, 6, 7)>
    - <1, (0, 6, 8)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 5, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - 3-star: <3, (0, 5, 6)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbor = {1} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - 3-star: <5, (2, 3, 7)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 3, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - 3-stars: 
    - <6, (0, 1, 7)>
    - <6, (1, 3, 7)>
    - <6, (0, 3, 7)>
    - <6, (0, 1, 3)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 5, 6, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - 3-stars: 
    - <7, (1, 6, 8)>
    - <7, (5, 6, 8)>
    - <7, (1, 5, 6)>
    - <7, (1, 5, 8)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 7, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - 3-star: <8, (1, 7, 9)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbor = {8} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Adding all valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 20
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 20 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 32

Therefore, there are a total of [32] 3-stars in your graph.
