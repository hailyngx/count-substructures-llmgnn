Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, and node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 1} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {2, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 7, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 6, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 6, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:  
Add up all the valid configurations:  
- From Node 0: 20  
- From Node 1: 1  
- From Node 6: 4  
- From Node 7: 1  
- From Node 9: 4  

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 30  
Therefore, there are a total of [30] 3-stars in your graph.
