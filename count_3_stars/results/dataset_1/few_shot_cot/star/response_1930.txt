Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 6, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-Stars <3, (2, 5, 6)>, <3, (2, 5, 8)>, <3, (2, 6, 8)>, <3, (5, 6, 8)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-Star <4, (0, 8, 9)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {3, 6, 7, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-Stars <5, (3, 6, 7)>, <5, (3, 6, 9)>, <5, (3, 7, 9)>, <5, (6, 7, 9)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {3, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-Stars <7, (2, 5, 8)>, <7, (2, 5, 9)>, <7, (2, 8, 9)>, <7, (5, 8, 9)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 4, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-Stars <8, (0, 3, 4)>, <8, (0, 3, 7)>, <8, (0, 4, 7)>, <8, (3, 4, 7)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-Star <9, (4, 5, 7)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 1
Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 18

Therefore, there are a total of [18] 3-stars in your graph.
