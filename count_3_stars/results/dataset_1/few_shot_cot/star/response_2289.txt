Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 4

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {9} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {6, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 5, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-stars:
    - <4, (0, 5, 8)>
    - <4, (0, 5, 9)>
    - <4, (5, 8, 9)>
    - <4, (0, 8, 9)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-star:
    - <5, (0, 3, 4)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 4: 4 unique 3-stars
- From Node 5: 1 unique 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 = 5

Therefore, there are a total of [5] 3-stars in your graph.
