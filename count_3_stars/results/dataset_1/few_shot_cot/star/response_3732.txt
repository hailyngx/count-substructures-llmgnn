Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 6
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 5, 6} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 8} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {6, 7} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 5, 8} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 6} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 5, 7, 8} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 6} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 6} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 9**: No neighbors
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 18

Therefore, there are a total of [18] 3-stars in your graph. This count represents how many unique 3-star subgraphs can be formed based on the adjacency list provided.
