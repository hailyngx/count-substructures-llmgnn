Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 6
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 6

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 6, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <3, (2, 4, 6)> 
  - <3, (2, 4, 7)> 
  - <3, (2, 6, 7)> 
  - <3, (4, 6, 7)> 
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <4, (0, 3, 6)> 
- **Node 5**: Not connected to any other nodes.
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <6, (3, 4, 8)> 
  - <6, (3, 4, 9)> 
  - <6, (3, 8, 9)> 
  - <6, (4, 8, 9)> 
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {3} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {6} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 = 9

Therefore, there are a total of [9] 3-stars in your graph.
