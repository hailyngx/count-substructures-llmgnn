Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 3

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - 3-stars: <0, (4, 6, 8)>, <0, (4, 6, 9)>, <0, (4, 8, 9)>, <0, (6, 8, 9)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {6} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - 3-stars: <4, (0, 1, 5)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - 3-stars: <5, (3, 4, 8)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 2} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - 3-stars: <8, (0, 1, 5)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4 3-stars
- From Node 4: 1 3-star
- From Node 5: 1 3-star
- From Node 8: 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 7

Therefore, there are a total of [7] 3-stars in your graph.
