Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
        Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
        - **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3, 5} (4 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
        - **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 8} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = 1 (It has exactly 3 neighbors: 0, 3, 8)
        - **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 4, 5, 6} (5 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
        - **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 7} (6 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
        - **Node 4**: Neighbors = {2, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = 1 (It has exactly 3 neighbors: 2, 8, 9)
        - **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 3, 6, 8} (5 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
        - **Node 6**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 5, 8} (4 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
        - **Node 7**: Neighbors = {3, 8} (2 neighbors)
        - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
        - **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 5, 6, 7} (5 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
        - **Node 9**: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor)
        - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
        
        Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
        Add up all the valid configurations:
        - From Node 0: 4
        - From Node 1: 1
        - From Node 2: 10
        - From Node 3: 20
        - From Node 4: 1
        - From Node 5: 10
        - From Node 6: 4
        - From Node 8: 10
        
        Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 10 + 20 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 60
        
        Therefore, there are a total of [60] 3-stars in your graph.
