Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 6, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 7} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 8} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 4, 8} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
    - Unique 3-stars:
        - <2, (1, 3, 8)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2, 7, 8} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {6, 7} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 9} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 5, 6} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3, 9} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
    - Unique 3-stars:
        - <8, (1, 2, 3)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {6, 8} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Adding all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6

Therefore, there are a total of [6] 3-stars in your graph.
