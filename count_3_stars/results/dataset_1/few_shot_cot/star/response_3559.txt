Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8)

Node 3 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-star: <1, (5, 7, 8)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 5, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-star: <2, (3, 4, 9)>, <2, (3, 5, 9)>, <2, (4, 5, 9)>, <2, (3, 4, 5)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 6, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-star: <3, (2, 5, 7)>, <3, (2, 6, 7)>, <3, (5, 6, 7)>, <3, (2, 5, 6)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-star: <4, (0, 2, 9)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-star: <5, (1, 2, 7)>, <5, (1, 3, 7)>, <5, (2, 3, 7)>, <5, (1, 2, 3)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {3, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-star: <7, (1, 3, 5)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 6, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-star: <9, (2, 4, 8)>, <9, (2, 6, 8)>, <9, (4, 6, 8)>, <9, (2, 4, 6)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Adding up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 19

Therefore, there are a total of [19] 3-stars in your graph.
