Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 6

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 5, 7, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 2} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 6, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 3, 7, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {2, 7, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 6, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 6, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {4, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 36

Therefore, there are a total of [36] 3-stars in your graph.
