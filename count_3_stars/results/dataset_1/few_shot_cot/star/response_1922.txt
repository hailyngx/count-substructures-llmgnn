Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (4, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {9} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 7, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-stars: 
    - <2, (4, 6, 7)>
    - <2, (4, 6, 8)>
    - <2, (4, 7, 8)>
    - <2, (6, 7, 8)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {2, 7, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-stars: 
    - <6, (2, 7, 9)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2, 6, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-stars: 
    - <7, (2, 6, 8)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 7, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-stars: 
    - <8, (2, 5, 7)>
    - <8, (2, 5, 9)>
    - <8, (2, 7, 9)>
    - <8, (5, 7, 9)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 6, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-stars: 
    - <9, (0, 6, 8)>
  
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 11

Therefore, there are a total of [11] 3-stars in your graph.
