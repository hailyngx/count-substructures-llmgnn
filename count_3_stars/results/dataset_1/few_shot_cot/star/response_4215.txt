Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 3

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {9} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 5, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) <4, (0, 5, 6)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {4, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 4: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1

Therefore, there are a total of [1] 3-stars in your graph.
