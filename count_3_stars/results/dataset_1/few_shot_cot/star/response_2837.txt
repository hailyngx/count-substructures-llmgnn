Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 7, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - 3-Stars: <1, (0, 7, 9)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - 3-Stars: <3, (5, 6, 9)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - 3-Stars: <4, (5, 7, 8)>, <4, (5, 7, 9)>, <4, (5, 8, 9)>, <4, (7, 8, 9)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 4, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - 3-Stars: <5, (2, 3, 6)>, <5, (2, 4, 6)>, <5, (3, 4, 6)>, <5, (3, 4, 7)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {3, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - 3-Stars: <7, (1, 4, 8)>, <7, (1, 4, 9)>, <7, (1, 8, 9)>, <7, (4, 8, 9)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 4, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - 3-Stars: <9, (1, 4, 7)>, <9, (1, 4, 9)>, <9, (1, 7, 9)>, <9, (4, 7, 9)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 18

Therefore, there are a total of [18] 3-stars in your graph.
