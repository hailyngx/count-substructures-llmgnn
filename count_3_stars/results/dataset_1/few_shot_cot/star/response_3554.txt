Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 5

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0:** Neighbors = {2, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1:** Neighbors = {3, 4, 6, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 2:** Neighbors = {0, 3, 4, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 3:** Neighbors = {1, 2, 6, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 4:** Neighbors = {1, 2, 5, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 5:** Neighbors = {4, 6, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6:** Neighbors = {1, 2, 3, 5, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 7:** Neighbors = {1, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8:** Neighbors = {0, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9:** Neighbors = {4, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 6: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 26

Therefore, there are a total of [26] 3-stars in your graph.
