Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 6

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {3, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 9} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
  - <3, (0, 2, 6)>, <3, (0, 1, 6)>, <3, (1, 2, 4)>, <3, (2, 1, 4)>, <3, (0, 1, 2)>, <3, (4, 6, 9)>, <3, (0, 6, 9)>, <3, (1, 6, 9)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - <4, (1, 2, 7)>, <4, (1, 3, 2)>, <4, (1, 3, 7)>, <4, (2, 3, 7)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 7, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - <6, (2, 3, 7)>, <6, (2, 3, 9)>, <6, (3, 7, 9)>, <6, (2, 7, 9)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 6, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - <7, (0, 6, 8)>, <7, (4, 6, 8)>, <7, (0, 4, 6)>, <7, (0, 4, 8)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - <9, (3, 5, 6)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 8
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 8 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 22

Therefore, there are a total of [22] 3-stars in your graph.
