Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - 3-star: <0, (4, 5, 9)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star with less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star with less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 5, 8, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - 3-stars: <3, (1, 4, 5)>, <3, (1, 4, 9)>, <3, (1, 5, 9)>, <3, (4, 5, 9)>, <3, (4, 5, 8)>, <3, (5, 8, 9)>, <3, (4, 8, 9)>, <3, (1, 8, 9)>, <3, (1, 5, 8)>, <3, (4, 8, 5)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 5, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - 3-star: <4, (0, 5, 9)>, <4, (0, 3, 9)>, <4, (0, 3, 5)>, <4, (5, 8, 9)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
  - 3-stars: <5, (0, 4, 9)>, <5, (0, 3, 4)>, <5, (0, 4, 5)>, <5, (0, 5, 8)>, <5, (3, 4, 9)>, <5, (3, 4, 8)>, <5, (3, 5, 8)>, <5, (4, 8, 9)>, <5, (0, 4, 3)>, <5, (0, 3, 9)>, <5, (4, 5, 8)>, <5, (3, 5, 8)>, <5, (0, 8, 5)>, <5, (0, 8, 4)>, <5, (3, 8, 5)>, <5, (4, 8, 5)>, <5, (3, 8, 4)>, <5, (4, 9, 8)>, <5, (0, 8, 3)>, <5, (0, 4, 8)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star with less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star with less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 6, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - 3-star: <8, (3, 5, 6)>, <8, (3, 5, 7)>, <8, (3, 6, 7)>, <8, (5, 6, 7)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 3, 4} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - 3-star: <9, (0, 3, 4)>, <9, (0, 4, 5)>, <9, (0, 3, 5)>, <9, (1, 3, 4)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 20
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 = 43

Therefore, there are a total of [43] 3-stars in your graph.
