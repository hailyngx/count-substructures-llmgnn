Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list provided, we'll evaluate the number of 3-stars that can be formed for each node:

- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-star configurations: <0, (2, 5, 8)>, <0, (2, 5, 9)>, <0, (2, 8, 9)>, <0, (5, 8, 9)>

- **Node 1**: Neighbor = {5} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 5, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-star configuration: <2, (0, 5, 6)>

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 6, 7, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - 3-star configurations: <4, (3, 5, 6)>, <4, (3, 5, 7)>, <4, (3, 5, 8)>, <4, (3, 6, 7)>, <4, (3, 6, 8)>, <4, (3, 7, 8)>, <4, (5, 6, 7)>, <4, (5, 6, 8)>, <4, (5, 7, 8)>, <4, (6, 7, 8)>

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2, 4, 6} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - 3-star configurations: <5, (0, 1, 2)>, <5, (0, 1, 4)>, <5, (0, 1, 6)>, <5, (0, 2, 4)>, <5, (0, 2, 6)>, <5, (0, 4, 6)>, <5, (1, 2, 4)>, <5, (1, 2, 6)>, <5, (1, 4, 6)>, <5, (2, 4, 6)>

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 5, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-star configurations: <6, (2, 4, 5)>, <6, (2, 4, 7)>, <6, (2, 5, 7)>, <6, (4, 5, 7)>

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-star configuration: <7, (4, 6, 9)>

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-star configuration: <8, (0, 4, 9)>

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 7, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-star configurations: <9, (0, 3, 7)>, <9, (0, 3, 8)>, <9, (0, 7, 8)>, <9, (3, 7, 8)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Adding up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 35

Therefore, there are a total of [35] 3-stars in the given graph.
