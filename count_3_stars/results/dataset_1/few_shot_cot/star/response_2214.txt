Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3, 6, 7, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <2, (6, 7, 9)>, <2, (3, 7, 9)>, <2, (3, 6, 9)>, <2, (3, 6, 7)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-star: <4, (7, 8, 9)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {6, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-star: <5, (6, 8, 9)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-star: <6, (2, 5, 9)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-star: <7, (2, 4, 9)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-star: <8, (0, 4, 5)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} (7 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{7}{3} = 35\)
  - Unique 3-stars: 
    - <9, (1, 2, 3)>, <9, (1, 2, 4)>, <9, (1, 2, 5)>, <9, (1, 2, 6)>, <9, (1, 2, 7)>
    - <9, (1, 3, 4)>, <9, (1, 3, 5)>, <9, (1, 3, 6)>, <9, (1, 3, 7)>
    - <9, (1, 4, 5)>, <9, (1, 4, 6)>, <9, (1, 4, 7)>
    - <9, (1, 5, 6)>, <9, (1, 5, 7)>
    - <9, (1, 6, 7)>
    - <9, (2, 3, 4)>, <9, (2, 3, 5)>, <9, (2, 3, 6)>, <9, (2, 3, 7)>
    - <9, (2, 4, 5)>, <9, (2, 4, 6)>, <9, (2, 4, 7)>
    - <9, (2, 5, 6)>, <9, (2, 5, 7)>
    - <9, (2, 6, 7)>
    - <9, (3, 4, 5)>, <9, (3, 4, 6)>, <9, (3, 4, 7)>
    - <9, (3, 5, 6)>, <9, (3, 5, 7)>
    - <9, (3, 6, 7)>
    - <9, (4, 5, 6)>, <9, (4, 5, 7)>
    - <9, (4, 6, 7)>
    - <9, (5, 6, 7)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 35
Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 35 = 44

Therefore, there are a total of [44] 3-stars in your graph.
