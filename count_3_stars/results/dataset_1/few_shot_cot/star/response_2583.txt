Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 4

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1} (1 neighbor)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 5, 9} (4 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  <1, (0, 4, 5)>, <1, (0, 4, 9)>, <1, (0, 5, 9)>, <1, (4, 5, 9)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  <2, (5, 7, 8)>, <2, (5, 7, 9)>, <2, (5, 8, 9)>, <2, (7, 8, 9)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 6, 8, 9} (5 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  <3, (4, 5, 6)>, <3, (4, 5, 8)>, <3, (4, 5, 9)>, <3, (4, 6, 8)>, <3, (4, 6, 9)>, <3, (4, 8, 9)>, <3, (5, 6, 8)>, <3, (5, 6, 9)>, <3, (5, 8, 9)>, <3, (6, 8, 9)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 7, 8, 9} (5 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  <4, (1, 7, 8)>, <4, (1, 7, 9)>, <4, (1, 8, 9)>, <4, (3, 7, 8)>, <4, (3, 7, 9)>, <4, (3, 8, 9)>, <4, (7, 8, 9)>, <4, (1, 3, 7)>, <4, (1, 3, 8)>, <4, (1, 3, 9)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3} (3 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  <5, (1, 2, 3)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {3} (1 neighbor)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2, 4} (2 neighbors)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 4} (3 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  <8, (2, 3, 4)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3, 4} (4 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  <9, (1, 2, 3)>, <9, (1, 2, 4)>, <9, (1, 3, 4)>, <9, (2, 3, 4)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 34

Therefore, there are a total of [34] 3-stars in your graph.
