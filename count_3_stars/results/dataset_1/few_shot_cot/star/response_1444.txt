Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 6, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <1, (2, 3, 6)>, <1, (2, 3, 9)>, <1, (2, 6, 9)>, <1, (3, 6, 9)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <2, (1, 3, 5)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 2} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {6, 7, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <4, (6, 7, 8)>, <4, (6, 7, 9)>, <4, (6, 8, 9)>, <4, (7, 8, 9)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 5, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <6, (1, 4, 5)>, <6, (1, 4, 9)>, <6, (1, 5, 9)>, <6, (4, 5, 9)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-star: <8, (4, 7, 9)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 6, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <9, (1, 4, 6)>, <9, (1, 4, 8)>, <9, (1, 6, 8)>, <9, (4, 6, 8)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- Node 1: 4
- Node 2: 1
- Node 4: 4
- Node 6: 4
- Node 8: 1
- Node 9: 4
Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 18

Therefore, there are a total of [18] 3-stars in your graph.
