Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 6

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = 1 (Only 1 3-star can be formed)
  - 3-star: <0, (2, 3, 7)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = 1 (Only 1 3-star can be formed)
  - 3-star: <1, (3, 5, 8)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 5, 6, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - 3-stars: <3, (0, 1, 5)>, <3, (0, 1, 6)>, <3, (0, 1, 9)>, <3, (0, 5, 6)>, <3, (0, 5, 9)>, <3, (0, 6, 9)>, <3, (1, 5, 6)>, <3, (1, 5, 9)>, <3, (1, 6, 9)>, <3, (5, 6, 9)>
- **Node 4**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {3, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 2} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {3, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Adding all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 3: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 10 = 12

Therefore, there are a total of [12] 3-stars in your graph.
