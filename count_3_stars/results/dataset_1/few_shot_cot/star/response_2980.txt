Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, and node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 6, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 5, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 4, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 7: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 20

Therefore, there are a total of [20] 3-stars in your graph.
