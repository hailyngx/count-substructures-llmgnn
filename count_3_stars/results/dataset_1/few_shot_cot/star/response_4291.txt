Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 0

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {7, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {6, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-star: <4, (5, 6, 8)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 4, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <5, (1, 2, 4)>, <5, (1, 2, 6)>, <5, (1, 4, 6)>, <5, (2, 4, 6)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 4, 5} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <6, (1, 3, 4)>, <6, (1, 3, 5)>, <6, (1, 4, 5)>, <6, (3, 4, 5)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 = 9

Therefore, there are a total of [9] 3-stars in your graph.
