Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5, and node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {6} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: No neighbors
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2, 7, 8} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 9} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 9} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {3} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 7} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 7: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3

Therefore, there are a total of [3] 3-stars in your graph.
