Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {8, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 6, 7, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - <2, (1, 3, 7)>, <2, (1, 3, 9)>, <2, (1, 6, 7)>, <2, (1, 6, 9)>, <2, (3, 6, 7)>, <2, (3, 6, 9)>, <2, (7, 9, 6)>, <2, (7, 9, 3)>, <2, (6, 9, 7)>, <2, (6, 9, 3)>
  
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2, 6, 9} (3 neighbors)

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\>

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8} (7 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{7}{3} = 35\>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 20
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 9: 35

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 20 + 1 + 35 = 69

Therefore, there are a total of [69] 3-stars in your graph.
