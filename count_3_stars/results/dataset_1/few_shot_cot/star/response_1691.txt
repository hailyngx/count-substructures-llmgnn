Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 1} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 6, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 8**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
The only node that can form a 3-star is Node 7.
- From Node 7: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1
Therefore, there is a total of [1] 3-star in your graph.
