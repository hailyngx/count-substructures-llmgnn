Node 8 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {6, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 7, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - <4, (1, 7, 9)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 6, 8, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - <5, (0, 2, 6)>, <5, (0, 2, 8)>, <5, (0, 2, 9)>, <5, (0, 6, 8)>, <5, (0, 6, 9)>, <5, (0, 8, 9)>, <5, (2, 6, 8)>, <5, (2, 6, 9)>, <5, (2, 8, 9)>, <5, (6, 8, 9)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - <6, (3, 5, 7)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - <8, (3, 5, 9)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 8} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
  - <9, (0, 1, 2)>, <9, (0, 1, 4)>, <9, (0, 1, 5)>, <9, (0, 1, 8)>, <9, (0, 2, 4)>, <9, (0, 2, 5)>, <9, (0, 2, 8)>, <9, (0, 4, 5)>, <9, (0, 4, 8)>, <9, (0, 5, 8)>, <9, (1, 2, 4)>, <9, (1, 2, 5)>, <9, (1, 2, 8)>, <9, (1, 4, 5)>, <9, (1, 4, 8)>, <9, (1, 5, 8)>, <9, (2, 4, 5)>, <9, (2, 4, 8)>, <9, (2, 5, 8)>, <9, (4, 5, 8)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 20

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 20 = 33

Therefore, there are a total of [33] 3-stars in your graph.
