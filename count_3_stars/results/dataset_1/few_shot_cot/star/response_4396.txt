Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (9, 1) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 5
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 5

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 5} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {7, 9} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 3} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 2} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {6, 7} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 6, 7, 9} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {4, 5} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 5} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 8**: No neighbors
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 5} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 7: 1
Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6
Therefore, there are a total of [6] 3-stars in your graph.
