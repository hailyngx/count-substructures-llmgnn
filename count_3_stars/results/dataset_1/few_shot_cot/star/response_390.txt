Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 6, 7, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {8, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <1, (2, 4, 8)>, <1, (2, 4, 9)>, <1, (2, 8, 9)>, <1, (4, 8, 9)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-star: <5, (3, 4, 7)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {3, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-star: <6, (3, 8, 9)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 6, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <8, (0, 1, 6)>, <8, (0, 1, 9)>, <8, (0, 6, 9)>, <8, (1, 6, 9)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2, 6, 7, 8} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <9, (0, 1, 6)>, <9, (0, 1, 7)>, <9, (0, 1, 8)>, <9, (0, 6, 7)>, <9, (0, 6, 8)>, <9, (0, 7, 8)>, <9, (1, 6, 7)>, <9, (1, 6, 8)>, <9, (1, 7, 8)>, <9, (6, 7, 8)>

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 20 = 30

Therefore, there are a total of [30] 3-stars in your graph.
