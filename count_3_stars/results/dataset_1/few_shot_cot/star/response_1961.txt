Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 9} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 6} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)  
    - Unique 3-star: <1, (3, 4, 6)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {6} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 5} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)  
    - Unique 3-star: <3, (1, 4, 5)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 5, 6} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)  
    - Unique 3-stars: 
        - <4, (1, 3, 5)>
        - <4, (1, 5, 6)>
        - <4, (3, 5, 6)>
        - <4, (1, 3, 6)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 4, 6, 8} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)  
    - Unique 3-stars:
        - <5, (0, 3, 4)>
        - <5, (0, 4, 6)>
        - <5, (0, 3, 6)>
        - <5, (3, 4, 6)>
        - <5, (3, 4, 8)>
        - <5, (4, 6, 8)>
        - <5, (3, 6, 8)>
        - <5, (0, 4, 8)>
        - <5, (0, 6, 8)>
        - <5, (4, 6, 0)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 4, 5, 9} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)  
    - Unique 3-stars:
        - <6, (1, 2, 4)>
        - <6, (1, 4, 5)>
        - <6, (1, 4, 9)>
        - <6, (4, 5, 9)>
        - <6, (1, 2, 5)>
        - <6, (1, 2, 9)>
        - <6, (1, 5, 9)>
        - <6, (2, 4, 9)>
        - <6, (4, 5, 2)>
        - <6, (2, 5, 9)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {8, 9} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 9} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)  
    - Unique 3-star: <8, (5, 7, 9)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 6, 7, 8} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)  
    - Unique 3-stars:
        - <9, (0, 6, 7)>
        - <9, (0, 6, 8)>
        - <9, (0, 7, 8)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 4
Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 = 31

Therefore, there are a total of [31] 3-stars in your graph.
