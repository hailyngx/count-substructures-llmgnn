Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 5} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - 3-star: <1, (2, 8, 9)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 3, 8, 9} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
    - 3-star: <2, (0, 1, 3)>, <2, (0, 1, 8)>, <2, (0, 1, 9)>, <2, (0, 3, 8)>, <2, (0, 3, 9)>, <2, (0, 8, 9)>, <2, (1, 3, 8)>, <2, (1, 3, 9)>, <2, (1, 8, 9)>, <2, (3, 8, 9)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 6} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - 3-star: <3, (2, 5, 6)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {6} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 3} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 7} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - 3-star: <6, (3, 4, 7)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {6} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 9} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - 3-star: <8, (1, 2, 9)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 8} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - 3-star: <9, (1, 2, 8)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 1
Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 15
Therefore, there are a total of [15] 3-stars in your graph.
