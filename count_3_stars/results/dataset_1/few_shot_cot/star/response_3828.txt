Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, 6, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 7, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 5, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {7, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 6, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 7, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 5, 6, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 28

Therefore, there are a total of [28] 3-stars in your graph.
