Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 6

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 7, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {3, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {4, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 4: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 = 5
Therefore, there are a total of [5] 3-stars in your graph. 

The unique 3-stars are: <2, (0, 7, 8)>, <2, (3, 7, 8)>, <2, (0, 7, 3)>, <2, (0, 8, 3)>, <4, (5, 7, 9)>
