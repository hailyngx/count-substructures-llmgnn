Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, 6, and node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 6, 8, 9} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
    - 3-stars: <0, (2, 6, 8)>, <0, (3, 6, 9)>, <0, (2, 6, 9)>, <0, (3, 6, 9)>, <0, (2, 8, 9)>, <0, (3, 8, 9)>, <0, (2, 3, 6)>, <0, (2, 3, 9)>, <0, (2, 8, 9)>, <0, (3, 8, 9)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 9} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 4} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - 3-stars: <2, (0, 1, 4)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 8} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - 3-stars: <4, (2, 5, 8)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 9} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - 3-stars: <5, (4, 6, 9)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 5, 7, 9} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - 3-stars: <6, (0, 5, 7)>, <6, (0, 5, 9)>, <6, (0, 7, 9)>, <6, (5, 7, 9)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {6, 9} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 4} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 5, 6, 7} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
    - 3-stars: <9, (0, 5, 6)>, <9, (0, 5, 7)>, <9, (0, 6, 7)>, <9, (5, 6, 7)>, <9, (0, 6, 7)>, <9, (0, 5, 9)>, <9, (0, 6, 9)>, <9, (0, 7, 9)>, <9, (5, 6, 9)>, <9, (5, 7, 9)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 9: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 27

Therefore, there are a total of [27] 3-stars in your graph.
