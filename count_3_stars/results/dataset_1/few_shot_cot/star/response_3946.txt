Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 4

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 6} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 6, 7, 8} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 6, 9} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 3**: No neighbors
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 9} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 6, 7, 8} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2, 5} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 5} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 5} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {2, 4} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 4
Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 23

Therefore, there are a total of [23] 3-stars in your graph.
