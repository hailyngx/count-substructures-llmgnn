Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 7, and node 9

Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 6

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
  
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 7, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 4, 7, 8, 9} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)  
  - <2, (0, 7, 8)>, <2, (0, 7, 9)>, <2, (0, 8, 9)>, <2, (7, 8, 9)>

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {7, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 6, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <4, (2, 5, 6)>, <4, (2, 5, 9)>, <4, (2, 6, 9)>, <4, (5, 6, 9)>

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {4, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <6, (4, 7, 8)>, <6, (4, 7, 9)>, <6, (4, 8, 9)>, <6, (7, 8, 9)>

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)   
  - <7, (0, 3, 8)>, <7, (0, 5, 6)>, <7, (0, 5, 8)>, <7, (0, 6, 8)>, <7, (2, 5, 6)>, <7, (2, 5, 8)>, <7, (2, 6, 8)>, <7, (3, 5, 6)>, <7, (3, 5, 8)>, <7, (3, 6, 8)>

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 6, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <8, (0, 6, 7)>, <8, (2, 6, 7)>

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 4, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <9, (2, 3, 4)>, <9, (2, 4, 6)>, <9, (3, 4, 6)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:

- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 20
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 = 41

Therefore, there are a total of [41] 3-stars in your graph.
