Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 6) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 6
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 5

Response:
**Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:**

- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {3, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {6} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 2**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {3, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

**Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:**

The total number of 3-stars is the sum of the valid configurations, which in this case is 0 since none of the nodes have 3 or more neighbors to form a 3-star.

Therefore, there are a total of [0] 3-stars in your graph.
