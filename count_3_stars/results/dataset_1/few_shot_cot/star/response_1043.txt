Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {6, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {3, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 5, 7, 8, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - <6, (1, 8, 9)>, <6, (1, 9, 7)>, <6, (3, 9, 1)>, <6, (3, 9, 7)>, <6, (3, 1, 8)>, <6, (3, 8, 9)>, <6, (3, 8, 1)>, <6, (8, 9, 1)>, <6, (8, 9, 7)>, <6, (9, 1, 7)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 6, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <7, (2, 4, 6)>, <7, (2, 6, 9)>, <7, (4, 6, 9)>, <7, (6, 9, 2)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2, 3, 6} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - <8, (0, 1, 2)>, <8, (0, 1, 3)>, <8, (0, 1, 6)>, <8, (0, 2, 3)>, <8, (0, 2, 6)>, <8, (0, 3, 6)>, <8, (1, 2, 3)>, <8, (1, 2, 6)>, <8, (2, 3, 6)>, <8, (1, 3, 6)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 6, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <9, (1, 3, 6)>, <9, (1, 6, 7)>, <9, (3, 6, 7)>, <9, (1, 3, 7)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 32

Therefore, there are a total of [32] 3-stars in your graph.
