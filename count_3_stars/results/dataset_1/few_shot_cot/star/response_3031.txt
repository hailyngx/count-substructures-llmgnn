Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (3, 7) (4, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 7
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 6, and node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 7, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {8, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 3, 4, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {6, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 7: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 10 = 12

Therefore, there are a total of [12] 3-stars in your graph based on the adjacency list provided.
