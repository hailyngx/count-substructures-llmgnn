Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 5, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 5, 7, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 4, 6, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {3, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 27

Therefore, there are a total of [27] 3-stars in the graph provided.
