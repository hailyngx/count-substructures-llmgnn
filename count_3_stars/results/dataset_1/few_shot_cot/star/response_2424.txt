Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <2, (0, 4, 8)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <3, (1, 4, 8)>, <3, (1, 4, 9)>, <3, (4, 8, 9)>, <3, (1, 8, 9)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
  - <4, (0, 2, 8)>, <4, (0, 3, 8)>, <4, (0, 5, 8)>, <4, (0, 7, 8)>, <4, (2, 3, 8)>, <4, (2, 5, 8)>, <4, (2, 7, 8)>, <4, (3, 5, 8)>, <4, (3, 7, 8)>, <4, (5, 7, 8)>, <4, (0, 2, 4)>, <4, (0, 4, 5)>, <4, (0, 4, 7)>, <4, (2, 4, 5)>, <4, (2, 4, 7)>, <4, (4, 5, 7)>, <4, (3, 4, 5)>, <4, (3, 4, 7)>, <4, (4, 5, 7)>, <4, (3, 4, 8)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <5, (4, 7, 8)>
- **Node 6**: Not connected to any nodes.
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <7, (4, 5, 9)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 4, 5} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <8, (2, 3, 4)>, <8, (2, 3, 5)>, <8, (2, 4, 5)>, <8, (3, 4, 5)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {3, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 20
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 20 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 31
Therefore, there are a total of [31] 3-stars in your graph.
