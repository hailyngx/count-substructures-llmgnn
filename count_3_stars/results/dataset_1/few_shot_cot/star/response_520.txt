Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 4

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 4, 5} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 4, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(0\) as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(1\) 
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(1\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 9} (7 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{7}{3} = 35\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(0\) as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(0\) as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(0\) as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 35

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 35 = 41

Therefore, there are a total of [41] 3-stars in your graph.
