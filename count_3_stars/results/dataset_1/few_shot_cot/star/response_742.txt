Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 8} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {6, 8} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 8} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 9} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {2, 8} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 9} (6 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {4, 8} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 8: 20

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 20 = 21
Therefore, there are a total of [21] 3-stars in your graph.
