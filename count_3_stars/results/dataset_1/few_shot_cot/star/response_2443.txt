Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (9, 0) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 4

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
        Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
        - **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 9} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
        - **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3} (1 neighbor)
        - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
        - **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0} (1 neighbor)
        - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
        - **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 4} (2 neighbors)
        - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
        - **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 5, 6, 9} (5 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
        - **Node 5**: Neighbors = {4, 6} (2 neighbors)
        - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
        - **Node 6**: Neighbors = {4, 5} (2 neighbors)
        - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
        - **Node 7**: No neighbors
        - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
        - **Node 8**: No neighbors
        - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
        - **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 4} (2 neighbors)
        - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
        
        Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
        Add up all the valid configurations:
        - From Node 0: 1
        - From Node 4: 10
        
        Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 = 11
        Therefore, there are a total of [11] 3-stars in your graph. This count represents how many unique 3-star subgraphs can be formed based on the adjacency list provided.
