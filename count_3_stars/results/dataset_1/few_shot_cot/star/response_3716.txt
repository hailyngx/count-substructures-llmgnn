Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {7, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 1**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {2, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {6, 7, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Potential 3-stars: <5, (6, 7, 8)>, <5, (6, 7, 9)>, <5, (6, 8, 9)>, <5, (7, 8, 9)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 5, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 4, 5, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 5, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Potential 3-stars: <9, (0, 4, 5)>, <9, (0, 4, 8)>, <9, (0, 5, 8)>, <9, (4, 5, 8)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 21

Therefore, there are a total of [21] 3-stars in your graph.
