Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 9} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 6, 7, 9} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 2**: No neighbors
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 3**: No neighbors
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 4**: No neighbors
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {7, 8} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 9} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 5} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5, 9} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 6, 8} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 = 8
Therefore, there are a total of [8] 3-stars in your graph.
