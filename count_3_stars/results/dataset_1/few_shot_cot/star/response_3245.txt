Node 1 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 7
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 7, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - <0, (4, 6, 9)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 7, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - <1, (2, 7, 9)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 7, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - <2, (1, 4, 7)>, <2, (1, 7, 9)>, <2, (4, 7, 9)>, <2, (1, 4, 9)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {6, 7, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - <3, (6, 7, 8)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - <4, (0, 2, 7)>
- **Node 5**: Not connected to any other nodes.
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3, 4, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
  - <7, (1, 2, 3)>, <7, (1, 2, 4)>, <7, (1, 2, 9)>, <7, (1, 3, 4)>, <7, (1, 3, 9)>, <7, (1, 4, 9)>, <7, (2, 3, 4)>, <7, (2, 3, 9)>, <7, (2, 4, 9)>, <7, (3, 4, 9)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {3, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2, 7, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
  - <9, (0, 1, 2)>, <9, (0, 1, 7)>, <9, (0, 1, 8)>, <9, (0, 2, 7)>, <9, (0, 2, 8)>, <9, (0, 7, 8)>, <9, (1, 2, 7)>, <9, (1, 2, 8)>, <9, (1, 7, 8)>, <9, (2, 7, 8)>

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 = 28

Therefore, there are a total of [28] 3-stars in your graph.
