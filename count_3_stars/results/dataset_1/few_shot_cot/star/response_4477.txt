Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {7, 9} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 7} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
    - 3-star: <2, (5, 6, 7)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 6, 9} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - 3-star: <3, (4, 5, 6)>, <3, (4, 5, 9)>, <3, (4, 6, 9)>, <3, (5, 6, 9)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 6, 9} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - 3-star: <4, (3, 5, 6)>, <4, (3, 5, 9)>, <4, (3, 6, 9)>, <4, (5, 6, 9)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 4, 6, 7} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    - 3-star: <5, (2, 3, 4)>, <5, (2, 3, 6)>, <5, (2, 3, 7)>, <5, (2, 4, 6)>, <5, (2, 4, 7)>, <5, (2, 6, 7)>, <5, (3, 4, 6)>, <5, (3, 4, 7)>, <5, (3, 6, 7)>, <5, (4, 6, 7)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 4, 5, 7} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    - 3-star: <6, (2, 3, 4)>, <6, (2, 3, 5)>, <6, (2, 3, 7)>, <6, (2, 4, 5)>, <6, (2, 4, 7)>, <6, (2, 5, 7)>, <6, (3, 4, 5)>, <6, (3, 4, 7)>, <6, (3, 5, 7)>, <6, (4, 5, 7)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 9} (6 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
    - 3-star: <7, (0, 2, 5)>, <7, (0, 2, 6)>, <7, (0, 2, 9)>, <7, (0, 5, 6)>, <7, (0, 5, 9)>, <7, (0, 6, 9)>, <7, (2, 5, 6)>, <7, (2, 5, 9)>, <7, (2, 6, 9)>, <7, (5, 6, 9)>, <7, (1, 5, 6)>, <7, (1, 5, 9)>, <7, (1, 6, 9)>, <7, (5, 6, 9)>, <7, (1, 2, 5)>, <7, (1, 2, 6)>, <7, (1, 2, 9)>, <7, (1, 5, 6)>, <7, (1, 5, 9)>, <7, (1, 6, 9)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {9} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 4, 7, 8} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    - 3-star: <9, (0, 3, 4)>, <9, (0, 3, 7)>, <9, (0, 4, 7)>, <9, (0, 3, 8)>, <9, (0, 4, 8)>, <9, (0, 7, 8)>, <9, (3, 4, 7)>, <9, (3, 4, 8)>, <9, (3, 7, 8)>, <9, (4, 7, 8)>
  
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 7: 20
- From Node 9: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 = 59

Therefore, there are a total of [59] 3-stars in your graph.
