Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3, 5, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 5, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 5, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 5, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8} (7 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{7}{3} = 35\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 5, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 6, 7, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 35
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 35 + 4 + 10 = 71

Therefore, there are a total of [71] 3-stars in your graph.
