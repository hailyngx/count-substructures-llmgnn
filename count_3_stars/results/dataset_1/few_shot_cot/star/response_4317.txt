Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 5, 8, 9} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
    - <0, (1, 3, 5)>, <0, (1, 3, 8)>, <0, (1, 3, 9)>, <0, (1, 5, 8)>, <0, (1, 5, 9)>, <0, (1, 8, 9)>, <0, (3, 5, 8)>, <0, (3, 5, 9)>, <0, (3, 8, 9)>, <0, (5, 8, 9)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 2} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 7, 9} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - <2, (1, 7, 9)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 5, 6, 7} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - <3, (0, 5, 6)>, <3, (0, 5, 7)>, <3, (0, 6, 7)>, <3, (5, 6, 7)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {9} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 6} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - <5, (0, 3, 6)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 8} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - <6, (3, 5, 8)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2, 3} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 6, 9} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - <8, (0, 6, 9)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 4, 8} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - <9, (0, 4, 8)>, <9, (0, 4, 9)>, <9, (0, 8, 9)>, <9, (4, 8, 9)>
    

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 22

Therefore, there are a total of [22] 3-stars in your graph.
