Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 4

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 4, 5, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 6, 7, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {3} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 9: 1
Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 24

Therefore, there are a total of [24] 3-stars in your graph.
