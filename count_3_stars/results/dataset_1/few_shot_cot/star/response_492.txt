Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
        Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
        - **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 7, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
            - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
            - Unique 3-stars: <0, (2, 8, 9)>, <0, (2, 7, 8)>, <0, (2, 7, 9)>, <0, (7, 8, 9)>
        - **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 9} (3 neighbors)
            - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
            - Unique 3-stars: <1, (4, 7, 9)>
        - **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0} (1 neighbor)
            - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
        - **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
            - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
            - Unique 3-stars: <3, (8, 6, 9)>, <3, (6, 8, 9)>, <3, (4, 8, 9)>, <3, (4, 6, 9)>
        - **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 3} (2 neighbors)
            - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
        - **Node 5**: No neighbors
            - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
        - **Node 6**: Neighbors = {3, 7, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
            - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
            - Unique 3-stars: <6, (8, 7, 9)>, <6, (7, 8, 9)>, <6, (3, 7, 9)>, <6, (3, 8, 9)>
        - **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 6, 8, 9} (5 neighbors)
            - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
            - Unique 3-stars: <7, (0, 8, 9)>, <7, (0, 6, 9)>, <7, (0, 6, 8)>, <7, (0, 8, 6)>, <7, (0, 9, 8)>, <7, (0, 9, 6)>, <7, (6, 8, 9)>, <7, (6, 9, 8)>, <7, (8, 9, 6)>, <7, (8, 6, 9)>
        - **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 6, 7} (4 neighbors)
            - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
            - Unique 3-stars: <8, (0, 7, 6)>, <8, (0, 7, 9)>, <8, (0, 9, 6)>, <8, (7, 9, 6)>
        - **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 3, 6, 7} (5 neighbors)
            - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
            - Unique 3-stars: <9,(0,1,3)>, <9,(0,1,6)>, <9,(0,1,7)>, <9,(0,3,6)>, <9,(0,3,7)>, <9,(0,6,7)>, <9,(1,3,6)>, <9,(1,3,7)>, <9,(1,6,7)>, <9,(3,6,7)>
        
        Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
        Add up all the valid configurations:
        - From Node 0: 4
        - From Node 1: 1
        - From Node 3: 4
        - From Node 6: 4
        - From Node 7: 10
        - From Node 8: 4
        - From Node 9: 10
        Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 37
        Therefore, there are a total of [37] 3-stars in your graph.
