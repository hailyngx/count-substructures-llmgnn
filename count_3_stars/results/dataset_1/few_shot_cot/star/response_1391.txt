Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 6

Node 3 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 2

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <0, (1, 4, 6)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
  - <2, (3, 4, 6)>, <2, (3, 4, 7)>, <2, (3, 4, 9)>, <2, (3, 6, 7)>, <2, (3, 6, 9)>, <2, (3, 7, 9)>, <2, (4, 6, 7)>, <2, (4, 6, 9)>, <2, (4, 7, 9)>, <2, (6, 7, 9)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <3, (2, 5, 8)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 6, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <4, (0, 2, 6)>, <4, (0, 2, 7)>, <4, (0, 6, 7)>, <4, (2, 6, 7)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {3, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 4, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <6, (0, 2, 4)>, <6, (0, 2, 7)>, <6, (0, 4, 7)>, <6, (2, 4, 7)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 4, 5, 6} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - <7, (1, 2, 4)>, <7, (1, 2, 5)>, <7, (1, 4, 5)>, <7, (2, 4, 5)>, <7, (2, 4, 6)>, <7, (4, 5, 6)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 2: 20
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 20 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 40

Therefore, there are a total of [40] 3-stars in your graph.
