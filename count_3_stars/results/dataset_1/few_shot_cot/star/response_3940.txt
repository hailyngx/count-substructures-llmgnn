Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 5
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 0

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 5, 7, 9} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 4, 5, 7} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 7} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 5} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 4, 7} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 6**: Not connected to any other nodes
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 3, 5} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 8**: Not connected to any other nodes
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 7: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 23

Therefore, there are a total of [23] 3-stars in your graph.
