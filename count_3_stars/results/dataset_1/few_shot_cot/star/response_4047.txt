Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:  

- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 4} (2 neighbors)  
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 4, 6, 8} (5 neighbors)  
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - 3-stars: <>  

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 5} (3 neighbors)  
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - 3-stars: <2, (3, 4, 5)>

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 5, 8, 9} (5 neighbors)  
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - 3-stars: <3, (1, 2, 5)>, <3, (1, 5, 8)>, <3, (1, 8, 9)>, <3, (2, 5, 9)>

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2, 6, 7, 8, 9} (7 neighbors)  
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \)
  - 3-stars: <4, (1, 2, 9)>, <4, (1, 5, 9)>, <4, (1, 8, 9)>, <4, (2, 3, 9)>, <4, (2, 5, 9)>, <4, (3, 5, 9)>

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 7, 9} (4 neighbors)  
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - 3-stars: <>  

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 4} (2 neighbors)  
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 5} (2 neighbors)  
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 4, 9} (4 neighbors)  
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - 3-stars: <8, (1, 3, 9)>

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 5, 8} (4 neighbors)  
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - 3-stars: <>  

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:  
From the above calculations: 
- Node 1: 10
- Node 2: 1
- Node 3: 4
- Node 4: 35
- Node 5: 4
- Node 8: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 4 + 35 + 4 + 4 = 58

Therefore, there are a total of [58] 3-stars in your graph.
