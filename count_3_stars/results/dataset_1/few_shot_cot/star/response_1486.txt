Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 6, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-star: <0, (1, 6, 7)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 7, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-stars: <1, (0, 7, 8)>, <1, (0, 7, 9)>, <1, (7, 8, 9)>, <1, (0, 8, 9)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {7, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
  - 3-stars: <6, (0, 2, 3)>, <6, (0, 7, 8)>, <6, (0, 7, 9)>, <6, (2, 7, 9)>, <6, (3, 7, 9)>, <6, (0, 8, 9)>, and more.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 5, 6, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - 3-stars: <7, (0, 1, 6)>, <7, (0, 6, 9)>, <7, (1, 6, 9)>, <7, (0, 6, 8)>, and more.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 5, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-stars: <8, (1, 4, 5)>, <8, (1, 5, 6)>, <8, (1, 4, 6)>, <8, (4, 5, 6)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 6, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-star: <9, (1, 6, 7)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Adding up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 6: 20
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 40

Therefore, there are a total of [40] 3-stars in your graph.
