Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: No neighbors, cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor), cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4, 9} (2 neighbors), cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4, 6} (2 neighbors), cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3, 9} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - <4, (1, 2, 3)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {6, 7} (2 neighbors), cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 7, 9} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - <6, (3, 5, 7)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 8} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - <7, (5, 6, 8)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {7, 9} (2 neighbors), cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 6, 8} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - <9, (2, 4, 6)>, <9, (4, 6, 8)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 9: 2
Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 5

Therefore, there are a total of [5] 3-stars in your graph.
