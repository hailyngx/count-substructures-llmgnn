Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:  

- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)  
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.  

- **Node 1**: No neighbors  
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.  

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 5} (3 neighbors)  
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)  
  <2, (0, 3, 5)>  

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2, 6} (2 neighbors)  
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.  

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {6, 7, 8} (3 neighbors)  
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)  
  <4, (6, 7, 8)>  

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)  
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.  

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 7, 8} (4 neighbors)  
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)  
  <6, (3, 4, 7)>, <6, (3, 7, 8)>, <6, (4, 7, 8)>, <6, (3, 4, 8)>  

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 9} (3 neighbors)  
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)  
  <7, (4, 6, 9)>  

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4, 6} (2 neighbors)  
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.  

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor)  
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.  

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:  
Add up all the valid configurations:  
- From Node 2: 1  
- From Node 4: 1  
- From Node 6: 4  
- From Node 7: 1  

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 7  

Therefore, there are a total of [7] 3-stars in your graph. This count represents how many unique 3-star subgraphs can be formed based on the adjacency list provided.
