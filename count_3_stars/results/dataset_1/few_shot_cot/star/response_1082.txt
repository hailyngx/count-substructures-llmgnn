Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 
  - 3-stars: <0, (2, 3, 4)>

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 
  - 3-stars: <1, (2, 3, 8)>

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 3, 5, 8, 9} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\) 
  - 3-stars: <2, (0, 1, 3)>, <2, (0, 1, 5)>, <2, (0, 1, 8)>, <2, (0, 1, 9)>, <2, (1, 3, 5)>, <2, (1, 3, 8)>, <2, (1, 3, 9)>, <2, (1, 5, 8)>, <2, (1, 5, 9)>, <2, (1, 8, 9)>, <2, (3, 5, 8)>, <2, (3, 5, 9)>, <2, (3, 8, 9)>, <2, (5, 8, 9)>, <2, (0, 3, 5)>, <2, (0, 3, 8)>, <2, (0, 3, 9)>, <2, (0, 5, 8)>, <2, (0, 5, 9)>, <2, (0, 8, 9)>

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2, 7, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 
  - 3-stars: <3, (0, 1, 2)>, <3, (0, 1, 7)>, <3, (0, 1, 8)>, <3, (1, 2, 7)>, <3, (1, 2, 8)>, <3, (1, 7, 8)>, <3, (0, 2, 7)>, <3, (0, 2, 8)>, <3, (1, 2, 7)>, <3, (1, 2, 8)>

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {7, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 6, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 
  - 3-stars: <7, (3, 4, 6)>, <7, (3, 4, 8)>, <7, (3, 6, 8)>, <7, (4, 6, 8)>

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3, 7, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 
  - 3-stars: <8, (1, 2, 3)>, <8, (1, 2, 7)>, <8, (1, 2, 9)>, <8, (1, 3, 7)>, <8, (1, 3, 9)>, <8, (1, 7, 9)>, <8, (2, 3, 7)>, <8, (2, 3, 9)>, <8, (2, 7, 9)>, <8, (3, 7, 9)>

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 6, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 
  - 3-stars: <9, (2, 5, 6)>, <9, (2, 5, 8)>, <9, (2, 6, 8)>, <9, (5, 6, 8)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 20
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 50

Therefore, there are a total of [50] 3-stars in the given graph.
