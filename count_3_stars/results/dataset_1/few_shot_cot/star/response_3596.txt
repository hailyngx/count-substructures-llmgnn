Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 8) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:

- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 6, 7, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 5**: Not connected to any other nodes
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 1} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 3, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 8: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 = 9

Therefore, there are a total of [9] 3-stars in your graph.
