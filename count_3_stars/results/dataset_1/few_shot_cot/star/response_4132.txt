Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 4
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 1

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 4, 7, 9} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 6, 7, 9} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 6} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 5} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2, 7} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 3} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 2} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 4} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 8**: No neighbors
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 1} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 7: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 26

Therefore, there are a total of [26] 3-stars in your graph.
