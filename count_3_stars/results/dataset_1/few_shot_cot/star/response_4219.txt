Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {3, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {6, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-Star: <3, (0, 4, 5)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 5, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-Stars: <4, (2, 3, 5)>, <4, (3, 5, 9)>, <4, (2, 5, 9)>, <4, (2, 3, 9)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-Star: <5, (3, 4, 6)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 5, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-Stars: <6, (1, 2, 5)>, <6, (1, 5, 8)>, <6, (2, 5, 8)>, <6, (1, 2, 8)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 6, 7, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-Stars: <8, (1, 6, 9)>, <8, (1, 7, 9)>, <8, (6, 7, 9)>, <8, (1, 6, 7)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {4, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Adding all the valid configurations:
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 8: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 14

Therefore, there are a total of [14] 3-stars in your graph.
Here are the unique 3-stars found:
<3, (0, 4, 5)>, <4, (2, 3, 5)>, <4, (3, 5, 9)>, <4, (2, 5, 9)>, <4, (2, 3, 9)>, <5, (3, 4, 6)>, <6, (1, 2, 5)>, <6, (1, 5, 8)>, <6, (2, 5, 8)>, <6, (1, 2, 8)>, <8, (1, 6, 9)>, <8, (1, 7, 9)>, <8, (6, 7, 9)>, <8, (1, 6, 7)>
