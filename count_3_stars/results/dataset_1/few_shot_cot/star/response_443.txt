Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 
  - 3-star: <0, (3, 5, 8)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 7, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 
  - 3-star: <1, (2, 7, 8)>, <1, (2, 7, 9)>, <1, (7, 8, 9)>, <1, (2, 8, 9)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 6, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 
  - 3-star: <2, (1, 4, 8)>, <2, (1, 6, 8)>, <2, (4, 6, 8)>, <2, (1, 4, 6)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 6, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 
  - 3-star: <4, (2, 3, 6)>, <4, (2, 3, 8)>, <4, (2, 6, 8)>, <4, (3, 6, 8)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 7, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 
  - 3-star: <5, (0, 7, 9)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {2, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2, 4} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 
  - 3-star: <8, (0, 1, 4)>, <8, (0, 2, 4)>, <8, (1, 2, 4)>, <8, (0, 1, 2)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 8: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 18

Therefore, there are a total of [18] 3-stars in your graph.
