Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
        
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 5, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - Unique 3-star: <1, (0, 5, 9)>

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {8, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 7, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - Unique 3-stars: <3, (5, 6, 7)>, <3, (5, 6, 9)>, <3, (5, 7, 9)>, <3, (6, 7, 9)>

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 6, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - Unique 3-star: <4, (0, 6, 9)>

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 7, 8, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
  - Unique 3-stars: <6, (3, 4, 7)>, <6, (3, 4, 9)>, <6, (3, 7, 9)>, <6, (4, 7, 9)>, <6, (4, 6, 9)>, <6, (7, 8, 9)>, <6, (7, 6, 9)>, <6, (8, 6, 9)>, <6, (8, 7, 9)>, <6, (9, 8, 7)>

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {3, 6, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - Unique 3-star: <7, (3, 6, 9)>

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3}\) = 20
  - Unique 3-stars: <9, (1, 4, 9)>, <9, (1, 6, 9)>, <9, (1, 7, 9)>, <9, (1, 3, 9)>, <9, (4, 6, 9)>, <9, (4, 7, 9)>, <9, (4, 3, 9)>, <9, (6, 7, 9)>, <9, (6, 3, 9)>, <9, (7, 3, 9)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 9: 20

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 20 = 37

Therefore, there are a total of [37] 3-stars in your graph.
