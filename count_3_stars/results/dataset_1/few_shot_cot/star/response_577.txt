Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 6

Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 6

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 4, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-Stars:
    - <2, (0, 3, 4)>
    - <2, (0, 3, 6)>
    - <2, (0, 4, 6)>
    - <2, (3, 4, 6)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 7, 8, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - 3-Stars:
    - <4, (2, 5, 7)>
    - <4, (2, 5, 8)>
    - <4, (2, 5, 9)>
    - <4, (2, 7, 8)>
    - <4, (2, 7, 9)>
    - <4, (2, 8, 9)>
    - <4, (5, 7, 8)>
    - <4, (5, 7, 9)>
    - <4, (5, 8, 9)>
    - <4, (7, 8, 9)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3, 7, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - 3-Stars:
    - <6, (1, 3, 7)>
    - <6, (1, 3, 9)>
    - <6, (1, 7, 9)>
    - <6, (2, 3, 7)>
    - <6, (2, 3, 9)>
    - <6, (2, 7, 9)>
    - <6, (3, 7, 9)>
    - <6, (1, 7, 9)>
    - <6, (1, 2, 7)>
    - <6, (1, 2, 9)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {4, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 6: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 10 = 24
Therefore, there are a total of [24] 3-stars in your graph.
