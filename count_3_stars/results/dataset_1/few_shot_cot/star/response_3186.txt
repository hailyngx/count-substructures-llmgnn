Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 6, and node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 5, 7, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {6, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 1} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2, 6, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 20 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 42

Therefore, there are a total of [42] 3-stars in your graph.
