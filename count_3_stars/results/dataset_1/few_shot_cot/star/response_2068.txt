Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3, 4, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - 3-Stars: <0, (1, 2, 3)>, <0, (1, 2, 4)>, <0, (1, 2, 9)>, <0, (1, 3, 4)>, <0, (1, 3, 9)>, <0, (1, 4, 9)>, <0, (2, 3, 4)>, <0, (2, 3, 9)>, <0, (2, 4, 9)>, <0, (3, 4, 9)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 4, 6, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - 3-Stars: <1, (0, 2, 4)>, <1, (0, 2, 9)>, <1, (0, 4, 9)>, <1, (2, 4, 9)>, <1, (4, 6, 9)>, <1, (0, 2, 6)>, <1, (0, 6, 9)>, <1, (2, 6, 9)>, <1, (4, 6, 9)>, <1, (0, 4, 6)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 3, 4} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-Stars: <2, (0, 1, 3)>, <2, (0, 1, 4)>, <2, (0, 3, 4)>, <2, (1, 3, 4)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-Stars: <4, (0, 1, 2)>, <4, (0, 1, 9)>, <4, (0, 2, 9)>, <4, (1, 2, 9)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {3, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {7, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 4, 6, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - 3-Stars: <9, (0, 1, 4)>, <9, (0, 1, 6)>, <9, (0, 1, 8)>, <9, (0, 4, 6)>, <9, (0, 4, 8)>, <9, (0, 6, 8)>, <9, (1, 4, 6)>, <9, (1, 4, 8)>, <9, (1, 6, 8)>, <9, (4, 6, 8)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 9: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 34

Therefore, there are a total of [34] 3-stars in your graph.
