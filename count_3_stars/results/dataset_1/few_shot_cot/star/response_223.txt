Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 6

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 7, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 7, 8, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {8, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 5, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 5, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 21

Therefore, there are a total of [21] 3-stars in your graph.
