Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3, 5, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 4, 9} (4 neighbors)

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 5, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 6, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 5, 6, 8} (5 neighbors)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 5: 35
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 9: 10
Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 35 + 10 + 10 = 83

Therefore, there are a total of [83] 3-stars in your graph.
