Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, and node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8} (7 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{7}{3} = 35\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 1} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 6, 8, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {8, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 5, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 35
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 8: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 35 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 48

Therefore, there are a total of [48] 3-stars in your graph.
