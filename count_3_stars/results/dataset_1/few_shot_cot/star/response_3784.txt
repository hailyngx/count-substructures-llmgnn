Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <1, (4, 8, 9)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {6} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 6, 8, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - <3, (4, 6, 8)>, <3, (4, 6, 9)>, <3, (4, 8, 9)>, <3, (6, 8, 9)>, <3, (4, 8, 9)>, <3, (4, 9, 6)>, <3, (6, 9, 4)>, <3, (8, 9, 4)>, <3, (8, 9, 6)>, <3, (9, 6, 8)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <4, (1, 3, 7)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {3, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <6, (2, 3, 9)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <7, (0, 4, 9)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <8, (1, 3, 9)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
  - <9, (1, 5, 8)>, <9, (1, 5, 6)>, <9, (1, 5, 7)>, <9, (1, 5, 9)>, <9, (1, 7, 8)>, <9, (1, 7, 6)>, <9, (1, 7, 9)>, <9, (1, 8, 6)>, <9, (1, 8, 9)>, <9, (1, 6, 9)>, <9, (5, 7, 9)>, <9, (5, 8, 6)>, <9, (5, 8, 9)>, <9, (7, 8, 6)>, <9, (7, 8, 9)>, <9, (7, 6, 9)>, <9, (8, 6, 9)>, <9, (4, 6, 8)>, <9, (4, 6, 9)>, <9, (4, 8, 9)>
- **Node 10**: Not a valid node to form a 3-star.
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 20
Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 20 = 35
Therefore, there are a total of [35] 3-stars in the provided graph.
