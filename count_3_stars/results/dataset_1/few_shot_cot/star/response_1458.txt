Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 8
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 8} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
    - 3-Stars: <0, (2, 4, 8)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 9} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
    - 3-Stars: <1, (4, 7, 9)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 7, 9} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - 3-Stars: <2, (0, 4, 7)>, <2, (0, 4, 9)>, <2, (0, 7, 9)>, <2, (4, 7, 9)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2, 8} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - 3-Stars: <4, (0, 1, 2)>, <4, (0, 1, 8)>, <4, (0, 2, 8)>, <4, (1, 2, 8)>
- **Node 5**: No neighbors
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3, 6, 9} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    - 3-Stars: <7, (1, 2, 3)>, <7, (1, 2, 6)>, <7, (1, 3, 6)>, <7, (1, 2, 9)>, <7, (1, 3, 9)>, <7, (1, 6, 9)>, <7, (2, 3, 6)>, <7, (2, 3, 9)>, <7, (2, 6, 9)>, <7, (3, 6, 9)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 4} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 7} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
    - 3-Stars: <9, (1, 2, 7)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 17

Therefore, there are a total of [17] 3-stars in your graph.
