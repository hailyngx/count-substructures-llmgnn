Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: No neighbors. Cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 6, 7, 8, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
  - <3, (1, 4, 9)>, <3, (1, 5, 8)>, <3, (1, 6, 9)>, <3, (4, 5, 8)>, <3, (4, 6, 9)>, <3, (5, 6, 8)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {3, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3, 5, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 4, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 3: 6
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 6 + 10 + 4 = 30

Therefore, there are a total of [30] 3-stars in your graph.
