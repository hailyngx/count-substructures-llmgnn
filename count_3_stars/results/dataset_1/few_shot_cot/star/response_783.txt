Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {6, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 6, 8, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - Unique 3-stars: <4, (2, 5, 6)>, <4, (2, 6, 8)>, <4, (2, 5, 8)>, <4, (5, 6, 8)>, <4, (5, 6, 9)>, <4, (6, 8, 9)>, <4, (2, 6, 9)>, <4, (2, 8, 9)>, <4, (5, 8, 9)>, <4, (2, 6, 5)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 6, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Unique 3-stars: <5, (0, 4, 6)>, <5, (0, 6, 7)>, <5, (4, 6, 7)>, <5, (4, 6, 0)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 4, 5, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - Unique 3-stars: <6, (0, 4, 5)>, <6, (0, 5, 7)>, <6, (3, 4, 5)>, <6, (3, 5, 7)>, <6, (4, 5, 7)>, <6, (0, 4, 7)>, <6, (0, 5, 4)>, <6, (3, 4, 7)>, <6, (3, 7, 5)>, <6, (4, 7, 5)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Unique 3-stars: <8, (2, 4, 9)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Unique 3-stars: <9, (3, 4, 8)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 26
Therefore, there are a total of [26] 3-stars in your graph.
