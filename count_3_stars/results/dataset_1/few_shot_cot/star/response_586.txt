Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 8
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Possible 3-star: <5, (1, 2, 8)>
- **Node 6**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Possible 3-star: <8, (3, 5, 7)>
- **Node 9**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 8: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 = 2

Therefore, there are a total of [2] 3-stars in your graph.
