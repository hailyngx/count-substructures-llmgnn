Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {3, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <2, (1, 3, 7)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <3, (0, 2, 4)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 7, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <4, (3, 5, 7)>, <4, (3, 7, 8)>, <4, (5, 7, 8)>, <4, (3, 5, 8)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <5, (4, 7, 9)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 5, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <7, (2, 4, 5)>, <7, (2, 5, 9)>, <7, (4, 5, 9)>, <7, (2, 4, 9)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <8, (0, 4, 6)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 5, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <9, (1, 5, 7)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 13

Therefore, there are a total of [13] 3-stars in your graph.
