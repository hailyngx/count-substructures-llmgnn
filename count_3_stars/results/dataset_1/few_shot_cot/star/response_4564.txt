Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 0) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 5

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {7, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <1, (2, 3, 6)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 5, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <2, (1, 5, 8)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {3, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 6, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <5, (2, 4, 6)>, <5, (2, 4, 9)>, <5, (2, 6, 9)>, <5, (4, 6, 9)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Adding up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 5: 4
Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 = 6

Therefore, there are a total of [6] 3-stars in your graph.
