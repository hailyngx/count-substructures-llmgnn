Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 6, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Possible 3-star configurations:
    - <1, (2, 8, 9)>
    - <1, (6, 8, 9)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 5, 7, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - Possible 3-star configurations:
    - <2, (1, 8, 9)>
    - <2, (1, 5, 9)>
    - <2, (1, 7, 9)>
    - <2, (4, 5, 9)>
    - <2, (7, 8, 9)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {6, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 7, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Possible 3-star configurations:
    - <8, (1, 7, 9)>
    - <8, (1, 3, 9)>
    - <8, (1, 2, 9)>
    - <8, (7, 2, 9)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 5, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Possible 3-star configurations:
    - <9, (1, 2, 8)>
    - <9, (1, 5, 8)>
    - <9, (2, 5, 8)>
    - <9, (2, 7, 8)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
- From Node 1: 2
- From Node 2: 5
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 2 + 5 + 4 + 4 = 15

Therefore, there are a total of [15] 3-stars in your graph.
