Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 6, 7, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <1, (0, 6, 7)>, <1, (0, 7, 9)>, <1, (6, 7, 9)>, <1, (7, 9, 0)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 7, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <3, (0, 7, 8)>, <3, (0, 7, 9)>, <3, (8, 7, 9)>, <3, (7, 9, 0)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {6, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 5, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-star: <6, (1, 5, 7)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 6, 8, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <7, (1, 3, 6)>, <7, (1, 3, 9)>, <7, (1, 6, 9)>, <7, (3, 6, 9)>, <7, (1, 6, 8)>, <7, (1, 8, 9)>, <7, (6, 8, 9)>, <7, (3, 8, 9)>, <7, (1, 3, 8)>, <7, (3, 6, 8)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 4, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <8, (2, 3, 4)>, <8, (2, 3, 7)>, <8, (2, 4, 7)>, <8, (3, 4, 7)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 5, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <9, (1, 3, 5)>, <9, (1, 3, 7)>, <9, (1, 5, 7)>, <9, (3, 5, 7)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 4
Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 27

Therefore, there are a total of [27] 3-stars in your graph.
