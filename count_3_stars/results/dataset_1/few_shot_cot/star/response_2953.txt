Node 9 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {6, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 6, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-stars: <2, (0, 3, 6)>, <2, (0, 3, 7)>, <2, (0, 6, 7)>, <2, (3, 6, 7)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 5, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-stars: <3, (2, 4, 5)>, <3, (2, 4, 7)>, <3, (2, 5, 7)>, <3, (4, 5, 7)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
   - 3-stars: <4, (3, 5, 8)>, <4, (3, 5, 9)>, <4, (3, 8, 9)>, <4, (5, 8, 9)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 6, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-stars: <5, (3, 4, 6)>, <5, (3, 4, 9)>, <5, (3, 6, 9)>, <5, (4, 6, 9)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 5, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-stars: <6, (1, 2, 5)>, <6, (1, 2, 7)>, <6, (1, 5, 7)>, <6, (2, 5, 7)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-stars: <7, (1, 2, 3)>, <7, (1, 2, 6)>, <7, (1, 3, 6)>, <7, (2, 3, 6)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-stars: <8, (0, 4, 9)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-stars: <9, (4, 5, 8)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 26

Therefore, there are a total of [26] 3-stars in your graph.
