Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 9) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {3, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 7, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 4**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 5**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {3, 6, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 8**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 3, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up the valid configurations:
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 = 6
Therefore, there are a total of [6] 3-stars in your graph. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<3, (0, 7, 9)>
<7, (3, 6, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 3)>
