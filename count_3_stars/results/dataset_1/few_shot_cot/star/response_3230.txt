Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 7, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \({4 \choose 3} = 4\)
  - Possible 3-star configurations from Node 1: <1, (5, 6, 7)>, <1, (5, 6, 8)>, <1, (5, 7, 8)>, <1, (6, 7, 8)>
  
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {7, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \({3 \choose 3} = 1\)
  - Possible 3-star configuration from Node 3: <3, (4, 5, 6)>
  
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 6, 7, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \({5 \choose 3} = 10\)
  - Possible 3-star configurations from Node 4: <4, (3, 5, 6)>, <4, (3, 5, 7)>, <4, (3, 5, 9)>, <4, (3, 6, 7)>, <4, (3, 6, 9)>, <4, (3, 7, 9)>, <4, (5, 6, 7)>, <4, (5, 6, 9)>, <4, (5, 7, 9)>, <4, (6, 7, 9)>
  
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 3, 4, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \({5 \choose 3} = 10\)
  - Possible 3-star configurations from Node 5: <5, (0, 1, 3)>, <5, (0, 1, 4)>, <5, (0, 1, 8)>, <5, (0, 3, 4)>, <5, (0, 3, 8)>, <5, (0, 4, 8)>, <5, (1, 3, 4)>, <5, (1, 3, 8)>, <5, (1, 4, 8)>, <5, (3, 4, 8)>
  
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 4, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \({4 \choose 3} = 4\)
  - Possible 3-star configurations from Node 6: <6, (1, 3, 4)>, <6, (1, 3, 9)>, <6, (1, 4, 9)>, <6, (3, 4, 9)>
  
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 4, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \({4 \choose 3} = 4\)
  - Possible 3-star configurations from Node 7: <7, (1, 2, 4)>, <7, (1, 2, 8)>, <7, (1, 4, 8)>, <7, (2, 4, 8)>
  
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 5, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \({4 \choose 3} = 4\)
  - Possible 3-star configurations from Node 8: <8, (0, 1, 5)>, <8, (0, 1, 7)>, <8, (0, 5, 7)>, <8, (1, 5, 7)>
  
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \({3 \choose 3} = 1\)
  - Possible 3-star configuration from Node 9: <9, (2, 4, 6)>
  
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Adding all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 38

Therefore, there are a total of [38] 3-stars in your graph.
