Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 7, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 6, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <1, (2, 6, 7)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <2, (1, 3, 6)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 2} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <8, (0, 3, 9)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {7, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
 
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: <1, (2, 6, 7)>
- From Node 2: <2, (1, 3, 6)>
- From Node 8: <8, (0, 3, 9)>

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3

Therefore, there are a total of [3] 3-stars in your graph.
