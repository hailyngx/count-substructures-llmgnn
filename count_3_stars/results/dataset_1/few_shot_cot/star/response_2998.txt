Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 7
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 6

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <1, (4, 7, 9)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 3, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <4, (0, 1, 7)>, <4, (1, 3, 7)>, <4, (0, 3, 7)>, <4, (0, 1, 3)>
- **Node 5**: Not connected to any other nodes.
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {8, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 4, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <7, (1, 2, 4)>, <7, (1, 4, 8)>, <7, (2, 4, 8)>, <7, (1, 2, 8)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {6, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 7: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 = 9

Therefore, there are a total of [9] 3-stars in your graph.
