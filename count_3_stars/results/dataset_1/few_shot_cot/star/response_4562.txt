Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <2, (4, 8, 9)>
- **Node 3**: Not connected to any other node.
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {2, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {4, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 6, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <7, (0, 6, 9)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <9, (2, 5, 7)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3

Therefore, there are a total of [3] 3-stars in your graph.
