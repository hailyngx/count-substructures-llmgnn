Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 4

Response:
Given the graph information provided, we will calculate the number of 3-stars as follows:

- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 5, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 5, 8, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
  - <0, (1, 5, 9)>, <1, (0, 5, 9)>, <5, (1, 0, 9)>, <9, (3, 0, 1)>, <3, (0, 1, 9)>

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {6, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {3} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {3, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 17

Therefore, there are a total of [17] 3-stars in the provided graph.
