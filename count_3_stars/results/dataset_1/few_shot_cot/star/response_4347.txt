Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 2

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Possible 3-star: <2, (3, 4, 9)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 7, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Possible 3-stars: <3, (2, 5, 8)>, <3, (2, 7, 8)>, <3, (5, 7, 8)>, <3, (4, 5, 8)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 6, 7, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - Possible 3-stars: <4, (2, 5, 8)>, <4, (2, 7, 8)>, <4, (5, 7, 8)>, <4, (5, 6, 8)>, <4, (4, 5, 8)>, <4, (4, 6, 8)>, <4, (4, 7, 8)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 4, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Possible 3-stars: <5, (1, 3, 8)>, <5, (3, 4, 8)>, <5, (4, 8, 1)>, <5, (4, 8, 3)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {4, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 3, 4} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Possible 3-stars: <7, (0, 1, 4)>, <7, (3, 1, 4)>, <7, (3, 4, 0)>, <7, (3, 4, 1)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 5, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Possible 3-stars: <8, (3, 4, 5)>, <8, (3, 4, 6)>, <8, (4, 5, 6)>, <8, (4, 5, 3)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 27

Therefore, there are a total of [27] 3-stars in your graph.
