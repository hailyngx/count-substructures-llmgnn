Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 0) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 1
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 4

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 6, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 5, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Not connected to any node
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {6, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 4, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {6} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Adding up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 6: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 = 9

Therefore, there are a total of [9] 3-stars in your graph. This count represents how many unique 3-star subgraphs can be formed based on the adjacency list provided.
