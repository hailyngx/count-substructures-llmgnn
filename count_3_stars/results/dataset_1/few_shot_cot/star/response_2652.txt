Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 1

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: No neighbors, cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {9} (1 neighbor) - Cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3, 6} (2 neighbors) - Cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <3, (2, 5, 6)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor) - Cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <5, (3, 4, 7)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <6, (2, 3, 7)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5, 6} (2 neighbors) - Cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 8**: No neighbors, cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1} (1 neighbor) - Cannot form a 3-star.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3

Therefore, there are a total of [3] 3-stars in your graph.
