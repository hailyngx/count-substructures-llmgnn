Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 3) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 6

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4, 6} (2 neighbors)
    Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
    Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 3} (2 neighbors)
    Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 6, 7} (4 neighbors)
    Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    <3, (2, 4, 6)>, <3, (2, 4, 7)>, <3, (2, 6, 7)>, <3, (4, 6, 7)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 9} (3 neighbors)
    Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    <4, (0, 3, 9)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
    Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 9} (3 neighbors)
    Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    <6, (0, 3, 9)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {3} (1 neighbor)
    Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
    Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {4, 6} (2 neighbors)
    Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 6: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6
Therefore, there are a total of [6] 3-stars in your graph.
