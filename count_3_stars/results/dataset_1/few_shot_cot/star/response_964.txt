Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-star: <1, (5, 7, 8)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-star: <2, (0, 4, 6)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 6, 7, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - 3-star: <4, (2, 6, 7)>, <4, (2, 5, 6)>, <4, (5, 6, 7)>, <4, (5, 6, 9)>, <4, (6, 7, 9)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-star: <5, (1, 4, 6)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-star: <6, (2, 4, 5)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 4, 8, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - 3-star: <7, (1, 4, 8)>, <7, (1, 4, 9)>, <7, (1, 8, 9)>, <7, (4, 8, 9)>, <7, (4, 7, 9)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-star: <9, (0, 4, 7)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
There are 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 26 3-stars in total.

Therefore, there are [26] 3-stars in your graph.
