Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 0

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {9} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 7, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-Star: <4, (1, 3, 5)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {4, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {3} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {3, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
There is only one unique 3-star in this graph:
- From Node 4: 1

Therefore, there are a total of [1] 3-stars in your graph.
