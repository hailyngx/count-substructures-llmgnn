Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (2, 5) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 4

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Possible 3-stars: <4, (5, 7, 8)>, <4, (5, 7, 9)>, <4, (5, 8, 9)>, <4, (7, 8, 9)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
  - Possible 3-stars: <5, (0, 2, 4)>, <5, (0, 2, 6)>, <5, (0, 2, 7)>, <5, (0, 2, 8)>, <5, (0, 4, 6)>, <5, (0, 4, 7)>, <5, (0, 4, 8)>, <5, (0, 6, 7)>, <5, (0, 6, 8)>, <5, (0, 7, 8)>, <5, (2, 4, 6)>, <5, (2, 4, 7)>, <5, (2, 4, 8)>, <5, (2, 6, 7)>, <5, (2, 6, 8)>, <5, (2, 7, 8)>, <5, (4, 6, 7)>, <5, (4, 6, 8)>, <5, (4, 7, 8)>, <5, (6, 7, 8)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 5, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Possible 3-stars: <8, (3, 4, 5)>, <8, (3, 4, 6)>, <8, (3, 5, 6)>, <8, (4, 5, 6)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Adding all the valid configurations:
- From Node 4: 4 (4 unique configurations)
- From Node 5: 20 (20 unique configurations)
- From Node 8: 4 (4 unique configurations)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 20 + 4 = 28

Therefore, there are a total of [28] 3-stars in your graph.
