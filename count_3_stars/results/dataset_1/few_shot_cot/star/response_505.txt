Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 7
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list provided, we'll analyze each node:

- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

- **Node 1**: Not connected to any other nodes, cannot form a 3-star.

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {6} (1 neighbor), cannot form a 3-star.

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 8} (2 neighbors), cannot form a 3-star.

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor), cannot form a 3-star.

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0} (1 neighbor), cannot form a 3-star.

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {2, 7} (2 neighbors), cannot form a 3-star.

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {3, 9} (2 neighbors), cannot form a 3-star.

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor), cannot form a 3-star.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:

- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 7: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 = 2

Therefore, there are a total of [2] 3-stars in your graph.
