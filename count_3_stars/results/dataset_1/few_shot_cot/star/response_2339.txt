Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {6} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 7, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-Stars: <2, (3, 5, 7)>, <2, (3, 5, 9)>, <2, (3, 7, 9)>, <2, (5, 7, 9)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 6, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-Stars: <4, (0, 6, 8)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-Stars: <6, (1, 8, 9)>, <6, (4, 8, 9)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-Stars: <7, (2, 8, 9)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 6, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-Stars: <8, (0, 6, 7)>, <8, (4, 6, 7)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {2, 6, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-Stars: <9, (2, 6, 7)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 2: 4 unique 3-stars
- From Node 4: 1 unique 3-star
- From Node 6: 4 unique 3-stars
- From Node 7: 1 unique 3-star
- From Node 8: 4 unique 3-stars
- From Node 9: 1 unique 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 15

Therefore, there are a total of [15] 3-stars in your graph.
