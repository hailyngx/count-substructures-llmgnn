Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 10 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 7) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 1
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {6} (1 neighbor)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 7} (2 neighbors)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 5**: No neighbors
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
  
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {3} (1 neighbor)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2, 4} (2 neighbors)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1} (1 neighbor)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 9**: No neighbors
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
  
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
There are no nodes with 3 or more neighbors, so no 3-star configurations can be formed in this graph.

Therefore, there are a total of [0] 3-stars in your graph.
