Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 6

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4, 6} (2 neighbors)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: No neighbors
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 8} (3 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 8} (3 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 9} (2 neighbors)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 9} (3 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 6} (3 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 6} (3 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 9

Therefore, there are a total of [9] 3-stars in your graph.
