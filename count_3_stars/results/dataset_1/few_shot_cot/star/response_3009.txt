Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 5

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: No neighbors, cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor), cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 7, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Unique 3-stars: <2, (1, 3, 7)>, <2, (1, 3, 9)>, <2, (1, 7, 9)>, <2, (3, 7, 9)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 6, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Unique 3-stars: <3, (2, 5, 6)>, <3, (2, 5, 7)>, <3, (2, 6, 7)>, <3, (5, 6, 7)>
- **Node 4**: No neighbors, cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {3, 6, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Unique 3-star: <5, (3, 6, 9)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Unique 3-star: <6, (3, 5, 8)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2, 3} (2 neighbors), cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {6} (1 neighbor), cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {2, 5} (2 neighbors), cannot form a 3-star.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 10

Therefore, there are a total of [10] 3-stars in your graph.
