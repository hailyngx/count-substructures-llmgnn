Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 7
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {3, 7} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 5} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - <1, (2, 3, 5)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 6, 9} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - <2, (1, 3, 6)>, <2, (1, 3, 9)>, <2, (3, 6, 9)>, <2, (1, 6, 9)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2, 7} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - <3, (0, 1, 2)>, <3, (1, 2, 7)>, <3, (0, 2, 7)>, <3, (0, 1, 7)>
- **Node 4**: No neighbors
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 7} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {2, 7, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - <6, (2, 7, 8)>, <6, (2, 7, 9)>, <6, (7, 8, 9)>, <6, (2, 8, 9)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 5, 6} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - <7, (0, 3, 5)>, <7, (0, 3, 6)>, <7, (0, 5, 6)>, <7, (3, 5, 6)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {6, 9} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {2, 6, 8} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - <9, (2, 6, 8)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 18

Therefore, there are a total of [18] 3-stars in your graph.
