Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 5, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \({4 \choose 3} = 4\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \({3 \choose 3} = 1\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {8, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 2} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 7, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \({4 \choose 3} = 4\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {6, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \({3 \choose 3} = 1\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {3, 6, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \({3 \choose 3} = 1\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \({3 \choose 3} = 1\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 12

Therefore, there are a total of [12] 3-stars in your graph.
