Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 6

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: No neighbors
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 5, 7, 9} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 3} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2, 6, 9} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 6, 7, 9} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 6} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 5, 9} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 4} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: No neighbors
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 4, 6} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 23

Therefore, there are a total of [23] 3-stars in your graph.
