Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: No neighbors. Cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 7, 8, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - Possible 3-stars: <1, (2, 5, 7)>, <1, (2, 5, 8)>, <1, (2, 5, 9)>, <1, (2, 7, 8)>, <1, (2, 7, 9)>, <1, (2, 8, 9)>, <1, (5, 7, 8)>, <1, (5, 7, 9)>, <1, (5, 8, 9)>, <1, (7, 8, 9)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star with less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {9} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star with less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {6, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star with less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star with less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {4, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star with less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 4, 5, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - Possible 3-stars: <7, (1, 2, 4)>, <7, (1, 2, 5)>, <7, (1, 2, 9)>, <7, (1, 4, 5)>, <7, (1, 4, 9)>, <7, (1, 5, 9)>, <7, (2, 4, 5)>, <7, (2, 4, 9)>, <7, (2, 5, 9)>, <7, (4, 5, 9)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star with less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Possible 3-star: <9, (1, 3, 7)>
  
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 1 = 21

Therefore, there are a total of [21] 3-stars in your graph.
