Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 8) (3, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 6, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 5, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-star: <1, (0, 5, 7)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-star: <8, (2, 4, 9)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {6, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 8: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 = 2

Therefore, there are a total of [2] 3-stars in your graph.
