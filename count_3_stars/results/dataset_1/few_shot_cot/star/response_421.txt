Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 7, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 4, 5} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {9} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {3, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 7: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 7
Therefore, there are a total of [7] 3-stars in your graph.
