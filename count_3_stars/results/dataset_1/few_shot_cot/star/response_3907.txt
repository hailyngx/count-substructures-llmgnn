Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 6, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {3, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {3, 6, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 8**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 7
Therefore, there are a total of [7] 3-stars in your graph.
