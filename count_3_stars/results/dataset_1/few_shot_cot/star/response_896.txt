Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 6, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Unique 3-star configurations: <0, (2, 6, 8)>, <0, (4, 6, 8)>, <0, (2, 4, 8)>, <0, (2, 4, 6)>
  
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 5, 7, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Unique 3-star configurations: <2, (0, 7, 9)>, <2, (0, 5, 7)>, <2, (5, 7, 9)>, <2, (0, 5, 9)>
  
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Unique 3-star configuration: <3, (5, 7, 9)>
  
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3, 6, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - Unique 3-star configurations: <5, (1, 3, 6)>, <5, (1, 3, 8)>, <5, (1, 6, 8)>, <5, (3, 6, 8)>, <5, (1, 2, 3)>, <5, (2, 3, 6)>, <5, (2, 3, 8)>, <5, (1, 2, 6)>, <5, (1, 2, 8)>, <5, (2, 6, 8)>
  
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 5, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Unique 3-star configuration: <6, (0, 5, 8)>
  
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Unique 3-star configurations: <7, (1, 3, 9)>, <7, (1, 2, 9)>, <7, (2, 3, 9)>, <7, (1, 2, 3)>
  
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 5, 6, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - Unique 3-star configurations: <8, (0, 5, 6)>, <8, (0, 5, 9)>, <8, (0, 6, 9)>, <8, (5, 6, 9)>, <8, (0, 5, 6)>, <8, (0, 5, 9)>, <8, (0, 6, 9)>, <8, (5, 6, 9)>, <8, (0, 5, 6)>, <8, (0, 5, 9)>
  
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 7, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Unique 3-star configurations: <9, (2, 7, 8)>, <9, (2, 3, 7)>, <9, (3, 7, 8)>, <9, (2, 3, 8)>
  
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 38

Therefore, there are a total of [38] 3-stars in your graph.
