Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 7, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 5, 8, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 2} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9} (8 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{8}{3}\) = 56
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {2, 7, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 56
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 56 + 1 = 70

Therefore, there are a total of [70] 3-stars in your graph.
