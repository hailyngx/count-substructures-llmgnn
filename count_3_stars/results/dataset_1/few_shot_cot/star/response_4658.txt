Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {6} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 5, 6, 7, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - 3-stars: 
    - <4, (0, 5, 6)>
    - <4, (0, 6, 9)>
    - <4, (5, 6, 7)>
    - <4, (6, 7, 9)>
    - <4, (5, 7, 9)>

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {4, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 4, 8, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - 3-stars: 
    - <6, (0, 4, 8)>
    - <6, (0, 8, 9)>
    - <6, (4, 8, 9)>
    - <6, (4, 7, 9)>
    - <6, (7, 8, 9)>

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 5, 8, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - 3-stars: 
    - <7, (4, 5, 8)>
    - <7, (4, 7, 9)>
    - <7, (5, 7, 9)>
    - <7, (6, 7, 9)>
    - <7, (7, 8, 9)>

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {6, 7, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\>

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 6, 7, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\>
  - 3-stars: 
    - <9, (4, 6, 7)>
    - <9, (4, 7, 8)>
    - <9, (6, 7, 8)>
    - <9, (6, 7, 9)>
    - <9, (7, 8, 9)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 4: 5
- From Node 6: 5
- From Node 7: 5
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 5
Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 1 + 5 = 22
Therefore, there are a total of [22] 3-stars in your graph. This count represents how many unique 3-star subgraphs can be formed based on the adjacency list provided.
