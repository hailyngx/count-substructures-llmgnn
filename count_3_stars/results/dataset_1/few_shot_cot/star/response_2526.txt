Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 5

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 4, 7, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - Possible 3-star configurations: <5, (0, 2, 4)>, <5, (0, 2, 7)>, <5, (0, 2, 9)>, <5, (0, 4, 7)>, <5, (0, 4, 9)>, <5, (0, 7, 9)>, <5, (2, 4, 7)>, <5, (2, 4, 9)>, <5, (2, 7, 9)>, <5, (4, 7, 9)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {7, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {2, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 5: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 10
Therefore, there are a total of [10] 3-stars in your graph.
