Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 5

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 5, 6} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 5, 6} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {6, 8} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 4, 7, 9} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2, 7} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5, 6} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2, 4} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {4, 5} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 20

Therefore, there are a total of [20] 3-stars in your graph.
