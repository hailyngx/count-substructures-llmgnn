Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: No neighbors
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 6} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4, 9} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {3, 6, 8} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
    - 3-Star: <4, (3, 6, 8)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 7, 9} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
    - 3-Stars: <6, (1, 4, 7)>, <6, (1, 4, 9)>, <6, (4, 7, 9)>, <6, (1, 7, 9)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {6, 8} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 7, 9} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
    - 3-Stars: <8, (4, 5, 7)>, <8, (4, 5, 9)>, <8, (4, 7, 9)>, <8, (5, 7, 9)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {3, 6, 8} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
    - 3-Star: <9, (3, 6, 8)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 10

Therefore, there are a total of [10] 3-stars in your graph.
