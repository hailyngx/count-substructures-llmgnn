Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, and node 8

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the graph you provided, we will apply the combinatorial calculation \( \binom{n}{3} \) to each node that has three or more neighbors. If it has exactly 3 neighbors, thereâ€™s only 1 3-star formed with that node. No 3-star is formed if less than 3 neighbors. 

- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {3, 7, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 5, 8, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 4, 7, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Adding up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 3: 20
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 9: 20

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 20 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 20 = 64

Therefore, there are a total of [64] 3-stars in your graph.
