Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {3, 6, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - 3-star: <0, (3, 6, 7)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 5, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - 3-stars: <1, (2, 3, 5)>, <1, (2, 3, 9)>, <1, (2, 5, 9)>, <1, (3, 5, 9)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 4, 6, 7, 8} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3}\) = 20
  - 3-stars: <3, (0, 6, 7)>, <3, (1, 6, 7)>, <3, (4, 6, 7)>, <3, (1, 6, 8)>, <3, (4, 6, 8)>, <3, (7, 6, 8)>, <3, (1, 7, 8)>, <3, (4, 7, 8)>, <3, (7, 8, 9)>, <3, (1, 7, 9)>, <3, (4, 7, 9)>, <3, (1, 8, 9)>, <3, (4, 8, 9)>, <3, (7, 8, 9)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {3, 7, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - 3-star: <4, (3, 7, 8)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 3, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - 3-stars: <6, (0, 3, 7)>, <6, (2, 3, 7)>, <6, (0, 3, 1)>, <6, (2, 3, 1)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 4, 6, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
  - 3-stars: <7, (0, 4, 6)>, <7, (0, 4, 8)>, <7, (0, 6, 8)>, <7, (3, 4, 6)>, <7, (3, 4, 8)>, <7, (3, 6, 8)>, <7, (0, 4, 3)>, <7, (0, 6, 3)>, <7, (4, 6, 3)>, <7, (0, 8, 6)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 7, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - 3-stars: <8, (3, 4, 7)>, <8, (3, 4, 9)>, <8, (3, 7, 9)>, <8, (4, 7, 9)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 3: 20
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 20 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 44

Therefore, there are a total of [44] 3-stars in your graph.
