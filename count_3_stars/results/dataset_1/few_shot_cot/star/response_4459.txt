Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, 6, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 5, 6, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(0\) as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(0\) as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(0\) as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 6, 7, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 5, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(0\) as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(0\) as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(0\) as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 5, 6, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 3: 20
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 9: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 20 + 10 + 10 = 50

Therefore, there are a total of [50] 3-stars in your graph.
