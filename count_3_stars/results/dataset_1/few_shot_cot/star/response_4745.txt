Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 6, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - **3-star configurations**: <1, (3, 4, 9)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {7, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - **3-star configurations**: <3, (1, 4, 9)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
  - **3-star configurations**: <4, (0, 1, 3)>, <4, (0, 1, 5)>, <4, (0, 1, 7)>, <4, (0, 1, 9)>, <4, (1, 3, 5)>, <4, (1, 3, 7)>, <4, (1, 3, 9)>, <4, (1, 5, 7)>, <4, (1, 5, 9)>, <4, (3, 5, 7)>, <4, (3, 5, 9)>, <4, (5, 7, 9)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - **3-star configurations**: <5, (4, 7, 8)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - **3-star configurations**: <6, (0, 1, 8)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 5, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - **3-star configurations**: <7, (2, 4, 8)>, <7, (4, 5, 8)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 6, 7, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - **3-star configurations**: <8, (2, 5, 6)>, <8, (2, 5, 7)>, <8, (2, 6, 7)>, <8, (5, 6, 7)>, <8, (5, 7, 9)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 4, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - **3-star configurations**: <9, (1, 3, 4)>, <9, (1, 3, 8)>, <9, (3, 4, 8)>, <9, (4, 8, 9)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 20 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 46 

Therefore, there are a total of [46] 3-stars in your graph.
