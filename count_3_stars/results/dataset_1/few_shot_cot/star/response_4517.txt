Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 6

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 6, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 3, 6, 7, 8} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2, 6, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {6, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 20
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 6: 20
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 20 + 4 + 20 + 1 + 1 = 47

Therefore, there are a total of [47] 3-stars in your graph.
