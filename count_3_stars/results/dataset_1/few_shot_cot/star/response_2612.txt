Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 5

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9} (6 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 5, 6} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 8} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 2} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 6} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 4, 6, 9} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 5, 8} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 6} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 5} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 20
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 8: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 38

Therefore, there are a total of [38] 3-stars in your graph.
