Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 6
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 1

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {3, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {6, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 5, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - Unique 3-stars:
    - <3, (0, 4, 5)>
    - <3, (0, 4, 6)>
    - <3, (0, 5, 6)>
    - <3, (4, 5, 6)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {2, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {3} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - Unique 3-stars:
    - <6, (1, 3, 7)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {6} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: No neighbors, cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 1} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Summing up the unique 3-stars configurations from each applicable node:
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 6: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 = 5

Therefore, there are a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
