Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 4) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 6
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - <4, (2, 5, 6)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - <5, (1, 4, 6)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 5, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - <6, (1, 4, 5)>, <6, (1, 4, 8)>, <6, (1, 5, 8)>, <6, (4, 5, 8)>
- **Node 7**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - <8, (0, 3, 6)>
- **Node 9**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.

Total number of 3-stars = 1 (from Node 4) + 1 (from Node 5) + 4 (from Node 6) + 1 (from Node 8) = 7

Therefore, there are a total of [7] 3-stars in your graph.
