Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 3) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9} (6 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 4, 8} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 8} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 6, 8} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 9} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {3} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3, 9} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 8} (3 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has exactly 3 neighbors.
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
- From Node 0: 20
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 8: 4
Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 32
Therefore, there are a total of [32] 3-stars in your graph.
