Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Not connected to any other nodes.
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {7, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Not connected to any other nodes.
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
Therefore, there are a total of [3] 3-stars in your graph.
