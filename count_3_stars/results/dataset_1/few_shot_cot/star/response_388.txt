Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 5
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {6} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 8} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - 3-star: <2, (4, 6, 8)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {2, 7} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 8} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 2} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 5} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - 3-star: <8, (2, 3, 5)>
- **Node 9**: No neighbors
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Total number of 3-stars = 1 (from Node 2) + 1 (from Node 8) = 2
Therefore, there are a total of [2] 3-stars in your graph.
