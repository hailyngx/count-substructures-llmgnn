Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list provided, we will analyze each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 3, 6, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <1, (0, 2, 3)>, <1, (0, 2, 6)>, <1, (0, 3, 6)>, <1, (2, 3, 6)>, <1, (2, 3, 8)>, <1, (3, 6, 8)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 4, 6, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <2, (1, 3, 6)>, <2, (1, 3, 9)>, <2, (1, 4, 6)>, <2, (1, 6, 9)>, <2, (3, 4, 6)>, <2, (3, 4, 9)>, <2, (4, 6, 9)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 5, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <3, (1, 2, 5)>, <3, (1, 2, 8)>, <3, (1, 5, 8)>, <3, (2, 5, 8)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {3, 6, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {9} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Considering the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 3: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 4 = 24

Therefore, there are a total of [24] 3-stars in the given graph.
