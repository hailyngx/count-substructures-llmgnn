Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 9
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 6

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - 3-star: <0, (1, 3, 4)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 3, 5, 6} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - 3-stars: 
    - <1, (0, 3, 6)>
    - <1, (0, 3, 5)>
    - <1, (0, 5, 6)>
    - <1, (3, 5, 6)>
    - <1, (0, 3, 2)>
    - <1, (2, 3, 6)>
    - <1, (2, 5, 6)>
    - <1, (0, 2, 5)>
    - <1, (0, 2, 6)>
    - <1, (2, 3, 5)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - 3-star: <3, (0, 1, 6)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - 3-star: <6, (1, 3, 9)>
- **Node 7**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - 3-star: <8, (2, 4, 5)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {6} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
There are 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 13 unique 3-stars in the graph.

Therefore, there are a total of [13] 3-stars in your graph.
