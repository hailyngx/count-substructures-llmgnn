Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - Unique 3-star: <0, (1, 8, 9)>
 
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 7, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - Unique 3-stars: <1, (0, 3, 7)>, <1, (0, 7, 9)>, <1, (3, 7, 9)>, <1, (0, 3, 9)>
 
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - Unique 3-star: <2, (4, 5, 9)>
 
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 7, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - Unique 3-star: <3, (1, 7, 9)>
 
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {2, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
 
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - Unique 3-star: <5, (2, 8, 9)>
 
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
 
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - Unique 3-star: <7, (1, 3, 4)>
 
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
 
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3}\) = 20
  - Unique 3-stars: <9, (0, 1, 2)>, <9, (0, 1, 3)>, <9, (0, 1, 5)>, <9, (0, 2, 5)>, <9, (0, 3, 5)>, <9, (1, 2, 3)>, <9, (1, 2, 5)>, <9, (1, 3, 5)>, <9, (2, 3, 5)>, <9, (0, 2, 3)>, <9, (0, 1, 6)>, <9, (0, 3, 6)>, <9, (1, 3, 6)>, <9, (0, 5, 6)>, <9, (2, 5, 6)>, <9, (7, 3, 1)>, <9, (7, 1, 0)>, <9, (7, 1, 3)>, <9, (7, 1, 9)>, <9, (7, 3, 9)>
 
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 9: 20
Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 20 = 29

Therefore, there are a total of [29] 3-stars in your graph.
This count represents how many unique 3-star subgraphs can be formed based on the adjacency list provided.
