Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 3

Node 3 is connected to node 1, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 4

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 2} (2 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = 0 as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 3} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  <1, (0, 2, 3)>
  
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7} (6 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
  <2, (0, 1, 4)>, <2, (0, 1, 5)>, <2, (0, 1, 6)>, <2, (0, 1, 7)>, <2, (1, 4, 5)>, <2, (1, 4, 6)>, <2, (1, 4, 7)>, <2, (1, 5, 6)>, <2, (1, 5, 7)>, <2, (1, 6, 7)>, <2, (4, 5, 6)>, <2, (4, 5, 7)>, <2, (4, 6, 7)>, <2, (5, 6, 7)>

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 7, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  <3, (1, 7, 8)>, <3, (1, 7, 9)>, <3, (7, 8, 9)>

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {2, 6, 9} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  <4, (2, 6, 9)>
  
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2, 8} (2 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = 0 as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {2, 4} (2 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = 0 as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2, 3} (2 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = 0 as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {3, 5} (2 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = 0 as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {3, 4} (2 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = 0 as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 0: 0
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 20
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 0
- From Node 6: 0
- From Node 7: 0
- From Node 8: 0
- From Node 9: 0

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 20 + 4 + 1 = 26

Therefore, there are a total of [26] 3-stars in your graph.
