Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Unique 3-stars: <0, (5, 8, 9)>, <0, (7, 8, 9)>, <0, (5, 7, 8)>, <0, (5, 7, 9)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Unique 3-stars: <1, (5, 8, 9)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {7, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 1} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {7, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
  - Unique 3-stars: <7, (0, 4, 9)>, <7, (0, 6, 9)>, <7, (2, 3, 4)>, <7, (2, 6, 9)>, <7, (0, 2, 9)>, <7, (0, 2, 6)>, <7, (0, 3, 4)>, <7, (0, 3, 9)>, <7, (0, 3, 6)>, <7, (0, 4, 6)>, <7, (2, 4, 9)>, <7, (2, 4, 6)>, <7, (2, 4, 9)>, <7, (2, 6, 9)>, <7, (4, 6, 9)>, <7, (0, 2, 4)>, <7, (0, 4, 9)>, <7, (0, 4, 6)>, <7, (2, 4, 6)>, <7, (4, 6, 9)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2, 6, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - Unique 3-stars: <8, (0, 1, 9)>, <8, (0, 6, 9)>, <8, (1, 6, 9)>, <8, (0, 1, 6)>, <8, (0, 2, 6)>, <8, (2, 6, 9)>, <8, (0, 2, 9)>, <8, (1, 2, 9)>, <8, (0, 1, 2)>, <8, (1, 2, 6)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 4, 7, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - Unique 3-stars: <9, (0, 1, 8)>, <9, (0, 4, 7)>, <9, (0, 7, 8)>, <9, (1, 4, 8)>, <9, (1, 7, 8)>, <9, (4, 7, 8)>, <9, (0, 1, 4)>, <9, (0, 1, 7)>, <9, (0, 4, 8)>, <9, (1, 4, 7)>

Total number of 3-stars = 4 (from Node 0) + 1 (from Node 1) + 20 (from Node 7) + 10 (from Node 8) + 10 (from Node 9) = 45

Therefore, there are a total of [45] 3-stars in your graph.
