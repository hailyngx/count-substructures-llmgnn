Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list provided, we will examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 4, 5, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <0, (1, 4, 8)>, <0, (1, 5, 8)>, <0, (2, 4, 8)>, <0, (2, 5, 8)>, <0, (1, 2, 4)>, <0, (1, 2, 5)>, <0, (1, 4, 5)>, <0, (1, 4, 9)>, <0, (4, 5, 9)>, <0, (5, 7, 8)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 6, 8, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <1, (0, 6, 8)>, <1, (0, 2, 8)>, <1, (0, 6, 9)>, <1, (0, 8, 9)>, <1, (2, 6, 8)>, <1, (2, 6, 9)>, <1, (2, 8, 9)>, <1, (6, 3, 7)>, <1, (6, 7, 8)>, <1, (7, 8, 9)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 1} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {6, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 7, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-star: <5, (0, 7, 9)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-star: <7, (3, 5, 8)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 7, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <8, (0, 1, 9)>, <8, (0, 7, 9)>, <8, (1, 7, 9)>, <8, (5, 7, 9)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 5, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <9, (1, 4, 8)>, <9, (1, 5, 8)>, <9, (4, 5, 8)>, <9, (5, 7, 8)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 30
Therefore, there are a total of [30] 3-stars in your graph.
