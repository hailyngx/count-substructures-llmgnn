Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 7) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 7
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 5

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1} (1 neighbor)
   - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 5, 9} (4 neighbors)
   - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
   - Unique 3-stars:
      - <1, (0, 4, 5)>
      - <1, (0, 4, 9)>
      - <1, (0, 5, 9)>
      - <1, (4, 5, 9)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor)
   - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: No neighbors
   - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 9} (2 neighbors)
   - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
   - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
   - Unique 3-star:
      - <5, (1, 8, 9)>
- **Node 6**: No neighbors
   - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2, 8} (2 neighbors)
   - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5, 7} (2 neighbors)
   - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 5} (3 neighbors)
   - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
   - Unique 3-star:
      - <9, (1, 4, 5)>
        
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6

Therefore, there are a total of [6] 3-stars in your graph.
