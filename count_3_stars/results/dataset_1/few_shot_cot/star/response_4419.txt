Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 9
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 9} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 4, 5} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 4} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 5, 9} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 5} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 4, 9} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 6**: No neighbors
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {9} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: No neighbors
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 5, 7} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 15

Therefore, there are a total of [15] 3-stars in your graph.
