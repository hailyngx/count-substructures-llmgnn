Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:

- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 
    - <0, (1, 2, 8)>

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 6, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 
    - <1, (0, 3, 6)>, <1, (0, 3, 9)>, <1, (3, 6, 9)>, <1, (0, 6, 9)>

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 7, 8, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    - <3, (1, 4, 7)>, <3, (1, 4, 8)>, <3, (1, 7, 8)>, <3, (1, 7, 9)>, <3, (4, 7, 8)>, <3, (4, 7, 9)>, <3, (4, 8, 9)>, <3, (7, 8, 9)>, <3, (1, 8, 9)>, <3, (7, 8, 9)>

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {3, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {6, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
    - <7, (3, 5, 9)>

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 3, 4} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 
    - <8, (0, 2, 3)>, <8, (0, 3, 4)>, <8, (2, 3, 4)>, <8, (0, 2, 4)>

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 
    - <9, (1, 3, 7)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 25

Therefore, there are a total of [25] 3-stars in your graph.
