Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 6, 7} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - 3-Stars: <0, (1, 2, 6)>, <0, (1, 2, 7)>, <0, (1, 6, 7)>, <0, (2, 6, 7)>
    
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 9} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
    - 3-Stars: <1, (0, 3, 9)>
    
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
    
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 5, 7, 8} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    - 3-Stars: <3, (1, 4, 5)>, <3, (1, 4, 7)>, <3, (1, 4, 8)>, <3, (1, 5, 7)>, <3, (1, 5, 8)>, <3, (1, 7, 8)>, <3, (4, 5, 7)>, <3, (4, 5, 8)>, <3, (4, 7, 8)>, <3, (5, 7, 8)>
    
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {3, 6, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - 3-Stars: <4, (3, 6, 8)>, <4, (3, 6, 9)>, <4, (3, 8, 9)>, <4, (6, 8, 9)>
    
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {3, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
    - 3-Stars: <5, (3, 8, 9)>
    
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 7, 9} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - 3-Stars: <6, (0, 4, 7)>, <6, (0, 4, 9)>, <6, (0, 7, 9)>, <6, (4, 7, 9)>
    
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 6} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
    - 3-Stars: <7, (0, 3, 6)>
    
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 5} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
    - 3-Stars: <8, (3, 4, 5)>
    
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 5, 6} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - 3-Stars: <9, (1, 4, 5)>, <9, (1, 4, 6)>, <9, (1, 5, 6)>, <9, (4, 5, 6)>
    
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 26
Therefore, there are a total of [26] 3-stars in your graph.
