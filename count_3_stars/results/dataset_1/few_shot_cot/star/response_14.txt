Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-star configurations: <2, (0, 3, 8)>, <2, (0, 3, 9)>, <2, (0, 8, 9)>, <2, (3, 8, 9)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 4, 6, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - Unique 3-star configurations: <3, (1, 2, 4)>, <3, (1, 2, 6)>, <3, (1, 2, 8)>, <3, (1, 4, 6)>, <3, (1, 4, 8)>, <3, (1, 6, 8)>, <3, (2, 4, 6)>, <3, (2, 4, 8)>, <3, (2, 6, 8)>, <3, (4, 6, 8)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {3, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {4, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {3, 7, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-star configurations: <6, (3, 7, 9)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {6, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 3, 5, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - Unique 3-star configurations: <8, (0, 2, 3)>, <8, (0, 2, 5)>, <8, (0, 2, 7)>, <8, (0, 3, 5)>, <8, (0, 3, 7)>, <8, (0, 5, 7)>, <8, (2, 3, 5)>, <8, (2, 3, 7)>, <8, (2, 5, 7)>, <8, (3, 5, 7)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {2, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 8: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 1 + 10 = 25

Therefore, there are a total of [25] 3-stars in your graph.
