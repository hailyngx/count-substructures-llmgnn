Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 2} (2 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors).

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} (7 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \)
  - Unique 3-stars: 
    - <1, (0, 2, 3)>
    - <1, (0, 2, 4)>
    - <1, (0, 2, 5)>
    - <1, (0, 2, 6)>
    - <1, (0, 2, 7)>
    - <1, (3, 4, 7)>
    - <1, (3, 4, 9)>
    - <1, (4, 7, 9)>
    - <1, (6, 2, 9)>
    - <1, (7, 4, 9)>

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Unique 3-star: <2, (0, 1, 6)>

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors).

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 7, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Unique 3-stars:
    - <4, (1, 3, 7)>
    - <4, (1, 3, 9)>
    - <4, (1, 7, 9)>
    - <4, (3, 7, 9)>

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Unique 3-star: <6, (1, 2, 9)>

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Unique 3-star: <7, (1, 4, 9)>

- **Node 8**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Unique 3-star: <9, (4, 6, 7)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 35
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 35 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 43  

Therefore, there are a total of [43] 3-stars in your graph.
