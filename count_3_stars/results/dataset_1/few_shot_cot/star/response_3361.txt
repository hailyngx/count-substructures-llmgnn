Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, and node 8

Node 3 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 5, and node 6

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {6, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 6, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <1, (2, 6, 7)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <3, (4, 6, 8)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {3, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2, 6, 7, 8, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - <5, (6, 7, 8)>, <5, (6, 8, 9)>, <5, (7, 8, 9)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 3, 5, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - <6, (0, 1, 5)>, <6, (0, 3, 5)>, <6, (1, 3, 5)>, <6, (1, 5, 9)>, <6, (3, 5, 9)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <7, (1, 5, 6)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <8, (0, 5, 6)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 24

Therefore, there are a total of [24] 3-stars in your graph.
