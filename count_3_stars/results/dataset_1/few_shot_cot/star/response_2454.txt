Node 9 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 5, 7} (3 neighbors)
	- Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
	- 3-Stars: <0, (1, 5, 7)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 5} (2 neighbors)
	- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 7, 9} (4 neighbors)
	- Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
	- 3-Stars: <2, (3, 5, 7)>, <2, (3, 5, 9)>, <2, (5, 7, 9)>, <2, (3, 7, 9)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2, 4} (2 neighbors)
	- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {3, 9} (2 neighbors)
	- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2, 8} (4 neighbors)
	- Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
	- 3-Stars: <5, (0, 1, 2)>, <5, (0, 1, 8)>, <5, (0, 2, 8)>, <5, (1, 2, 8)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {7, 9} (2 neighbors)
	- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 6} (3 neighbors)
	- Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
	- 3-Stars: <7, (0, 2, 6)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5, 9} (2 neighbors)
	- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 6, 8} (4 neighbors)
	- Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
	- 3-Stars: <9, (2, 4, 6)>, <9, (2, 4, 8)>, <9, (2, 6, 8)>, <9, (4, 6, 8)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 14
Therefore, there are a total of [14] 3-stars in your graph based on the given adjacency list.
