Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {6} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {7, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {7, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {6} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {8, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 5, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - 3-Star: <8, (1, 5, 9)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - 3-Star: <9, (3, 5, 8)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 = 2
Therefore, there are a total of [2] 3-stars in your graph.
