Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {7, 9} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 7} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - 3-star: \<1, (2, 5, 7)\>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 6} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {7, 9} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 9} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - 3-star: \<4, (5, 6, 9)\>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 6, 7} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - 3-stars: \<5, (1, 4, 6)>, \<5, (1, 6, 7)>, \<5, (4, 6, 7)>, \<5, (6, 7, 7)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 5, 7} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - 3-stars: \<6, (2, 4, 5)>, \<6, (2, 4, 7)>, \<6, (2, 5, 7)>, \<6, (4, 5, 7)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9} (7 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{7}{3} = 35\)
    - 3-stars: \<7, (0, 1, 3)>, \<7, (0, 1, 5)>, \<7, (0, 1, 6)>, \<7, (0, 1, 8)>, \<7, (0, 1, 9)>, \<7, (0, 3, 5)>, \<7, (0, 3, 6)>, \<7, (0, 3, 9)>, \<7, (0, 5, 6)>, \<7, (0, 5, 8)>, \<7, (0, 5, 9)>, \<7, (0, 6, 8)>, \<7, (0, 6, 9)>, \<7, (0, 8, 9)>, \<7, (1, 3, 5)>, \<7, (1, 3, 6)>, \<7, (1, 3, 8)>, \<7, (1, 3, 9)>, \<7, (1, 5, 6)>, \<7, (1, 5, 8)>, \<7, (1, 5, 9)>, \<7, (1, 6, 8)>, \<7, (1, 6, 9)>, \<7, (1, 8, 9)>, \<7, (3, 5, 6)>, \<7, (3, 5, 8)>, \<7, (3, 5, 9)>, \<7, (3, 6, 8)>, \<7, (3, 6, 9)>, \<7, (3, 8, 9)>, \<7, (5, 6, 8)>, \<7, (5, 6, 9)>, \<7, (5, 8, 9)>, \<7, (6, 8, 9)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 4, 7} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - 3-stars: \<9, (0, 4, 7)>, \<9, (0, 5, 7)>, \<9, (3, 4, 7)>, \<9, (4, 5, 7)>
    
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 35
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 35 + 4 = 49

Therefore, there are a total of [49] 3-stars in your graph.
