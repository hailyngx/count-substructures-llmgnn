Response:
The given graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node based on the provided adjacency list:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - Unique 3-star: <1, (2, 4, 7)>
  
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 3, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - Unique 3-stars: <2, (0, 1, 3)>, <2, (0, 1, 8)>, <2, (1, 3, 8)>, <2, (0, 3, 8)>
  
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 7, 8, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
  - Unique 3-stars: <3, (2, 5, 7)>, <3, (2, 5, 8)>, <3, (2, 5, 9)>, <3, (2, 7, 8)>, <3, (2, 7, 9)>, <3, (2, 8, 9)>, <3, (5, 7, 8)>, <3, (5, 7, 9)>, <3, (5, 8, 9)>, <3, (7, 8, 9)>
  
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 6, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - Unique 3-stars: <5, (0, 3, 6)>, <5, (0, 3, 9)>, <5, (0, 6, 9)>, <5, (3, 6, 9)>
  
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - Unique 3-star: <6, (4, 5, 9)>
  
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - Unique 3-star: <7, (1, 3, 8)>
  
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - Unique 3-star: <8, (2, 3, 7)>
  
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - Unique 3-star: <9, (3, 5, 6)>
  
Summing up the total number of 3-stars:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 23

Therefore, there are a total of [23] 3-stars in your graph.
