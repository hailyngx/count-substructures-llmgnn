Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: No neighbors, cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4, 9} (2 neighbors), cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 8} (2 neighbors), cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 5, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 4} (2 neighbors), cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5, 9} (2 neighbors), cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {2, 7, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 8

Therefore, there are a total of [8] 3-stars in your graph.
