Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 7
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 6

Response:
Given the graph information provided, we will calculate the number of 3-stars in the graph by following the method outlined in the example.

Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 3**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
  
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 6, 7, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - Unique 3-stars involving Node 4: <4, (0, 1, 7)>, <4, (0, 7, 8)>, <4, (1, 6, 7)>, <4, (6, 7, 8)>, <4, (0, 6, 8)>

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {4, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2, 4} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Unique 3-stars involving Node 7: <7, (0, 1, 4)>, <7, (0, 2, 4)>
  
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 0
- From Node 2: 0
- From Node 3: 0
- From Node 4: 5
- From Node 5: 0
- From Node 6: 0
- From Node 7: 2
- From Node 8: 0
- From Node 9: 0

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 5 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 0 + 0 = 8

Therefore, there are a total of [8] 3-stars in the provided graph.
