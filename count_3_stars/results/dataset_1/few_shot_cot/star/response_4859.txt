Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 6, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <1, (2, 5, 6)>, <1, (2, 5, 9)>, <1, (2, 6, 9)>, <1, (5, 6, 9)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <2, (1, 3, 6)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 5, 6, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <3, (2, 4, 5)>, <3, (2, 4, 6)>, <3, (2, 5, 6)>, <3, (4, 5, 6)>, <3, (2, 4, 7)>, <3, (2, 5, 7)>, <3, (2, 6, 7)>, <3, (4, 5, 7)>, <3, (4, 6, 7)>, <3, (5, 6, 7)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <4, (0, 3, 5)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 4, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <5, (1, 3, 4)>, <5, (1, 3, 8)>, <5, (1, 4, 8)>, <5, (3, 4, 8)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <6, (1, 2, 3)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {3, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <7, (3, 8, 9)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 5, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <8, (0, 5, 7)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 23

Therefore, there are a total of [23] 3-stars in your graph.
