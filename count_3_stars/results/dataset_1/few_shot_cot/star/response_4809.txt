Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 4
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 3

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {3, 6, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 7, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 2} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 8**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 7

Therefore, there are a total of [7] 3-stars in your graph.
