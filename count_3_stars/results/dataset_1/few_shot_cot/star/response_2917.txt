Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 7} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
    - Unique 3-Star: <0, (1, 2, 7)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 9} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
    - Unique 3-Star: <1, (0, 4, 9)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
    - Unique 3-Stars: 
        - <2, (0, 3, 8)>
        - <2, (0, 8, 9)>
        - <2, (3, 8, 9)>
        - <2, (0, 3, 9)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2, 6, 8} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
    - Unique 3-Star: <3, (2, 6, 8)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 7, 8} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
    - Unique 3-Star: <4, (1, 7, 8)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {3, 9} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 5} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
    - Unique 3-Star: <7, (0, 4, 5)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 4, 9} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
    - Unique 3-Stars:
        - <8, (2, 3, 4)>
        - <8, (2, 4, 9)>
        - <8, (3, 4, 9)>
        - <8, (2, 3, 9)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 6, 8} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
    - Unique 3-Stars:
        - <9, (1, 2, 6)>
        - <9, (1, 2, 8)>
        - <9, (1, 6, 8)>
        - <9, (2, 6, 8)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 4
Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 17

Therefore, there are a total of [17] 3-stars in your graph.
