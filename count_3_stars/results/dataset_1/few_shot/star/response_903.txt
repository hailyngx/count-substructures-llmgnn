Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, and node 8
