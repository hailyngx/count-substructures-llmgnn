Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the 3-stars by finding central nodes connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through the nodes and their neighbors to identify the 3-stars:

- Node 0: No 3-star since it is connected to 2 nodes.
- Node 1: 3-star found: <1, (0, 2, 8)>
- Node 2: 3-star found: <2, (1, 6, 7)>
- Node 3: No 3-star since it is connected to 1 node.
- Node 4: No 3-star since it is connected to 1 node.
- Node 5: No 3-star since it is connected to 2 nodes.
- Node 6: 3-star found: <6, (2, 5, 9)>
- Node 7: No 3-star since it is connected to 2 nodes.
- Node 8: 3-star found: <8, (0, 1, 7)>
- Node 9: No 3-star since it is connected to 2 nodes.

The unique 3-stars identified are <1, (0, 2, 8)>, <2, (1, 6, 7)>, and <6, (2, 5, 9)>. Therefore, the final answer is [3].
