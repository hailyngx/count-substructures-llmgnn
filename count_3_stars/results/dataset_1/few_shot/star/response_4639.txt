Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 8

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes of 3-stars. A central node must be a node with degree 3 since a 3-star involves the center node being connected to exactly three other nodes.

In this graph:
- Node 0 has degree 5 
- Node 1 has degree 3 
- Node 2 has degree 2 
- Node 3 has degree 2 
- Node 4 has degree 2 
- Node 5 has degree 3 
- Node 6 has degree 4 
- Node 7 has degree 3 
- Node 8 has degree 4 
- Node 9 has degree 2 

Based on the degrees, the central nodes for 3-stars are nodes 1, 5, and 7.

Now let's find the unique sets of 3-stars:
<1, (0, 5, 9)>
<5, (1, 2, 8)>
<7, (0, 6, 8)>
