Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each central node and its adjacent nodes to determine if they form a 3-star.

Here are the 3-stars in the given graph:
<[0, (2, 3)]>
<[1, (5, 8)]>
<[2, (0, 6, 8)]>
<[3, (0, 4, 6)]>
<[4, (3, 6)]>
<[5, (1, 8, 9)]>
<[6, (2, 3, 4)]>
<[7, (3, 8, 9)]>
<[8, (1, 2, 3), 4, (5, 7, 9)]>
<[9, (5, 7, 8)]>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
