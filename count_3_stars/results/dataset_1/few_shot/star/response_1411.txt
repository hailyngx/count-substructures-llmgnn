Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 5, 6, and node 8

Response:
To determine the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we can see that nodes 6, 7, and 9 each have exactly 3 connections. Let's list the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<6, (1, 4, 9)>
<7, (1, 4, 8)>
<9, (0, 1, 3)>
<9, (5, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
