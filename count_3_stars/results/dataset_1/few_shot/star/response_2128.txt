Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern. 

Looking at the given graph, we can identify the following 3-stars:

<0, (3, 4, 6)>
<1, (4, 5, 7)>
<2, (4, 5, 7)>
<4, (0, 1, 3)>
<4, (0, 2, 6)>
<4, (1, 2, 7)>
<6, (0, 4, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
