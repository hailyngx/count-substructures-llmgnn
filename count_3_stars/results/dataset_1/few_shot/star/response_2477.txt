Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes (leaves).

Here are the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<2, (3, 4, 6)>
<3, (2, 8, 9)>
<4, (2, 5, 8)>
<5, (4, 6, 7)>
<6, (1, 2, 9)>
<7, (2, 5, 8)>
<8, (0, 3, 7)>
<9, (1, 3, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
