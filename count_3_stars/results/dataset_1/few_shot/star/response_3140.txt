Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 3

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to understand what a 3-star is in the context of graphs. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Looking at the given graph, we can identify the following 3-stars:

<0, (4, 5)>  
<1, (5, 6, 8)>  
<4, (0, 6, 7)>  
<4, (0, 6, 8)>  

Count of 3-stars: [4]
