Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node and the leaf nodes connected to it. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we can see that the nodes and their connections are:
 - Node 0: (2, 6, 8)
 - Node 1: (4, 7)
 - Node 2: (0, 4, 6)
 - Node 3: (5, 6)
 - Node 4: (1, 2, 5, 8, 9)
 - Node 5: (3, 4, 7)
 - Node 6: (0, 2, 3)
 - Node 7: (1, 5, 9)
 - Node 8: (0, 4)
 - Node 9: (4, 7)

We will now list the unique 3-stars in the graph: 

<0, (2, 6, 8)>
<1, (4, 7)>
<2, (0, 4, 6)>
<3, (5, 6)>
<4, (1, 2, 5)>
<5, (3, 4, 7)>
<6, (0, 2, 3)>
<7, (1, 5, 9)>
<8, (0, 4)>
<9, (4, 7)>

Count of 3-stars in the graph: [10]
