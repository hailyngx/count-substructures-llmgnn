Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 3

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify all unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list them out step by step:

1. Node 0:
   - <0, (4, 6, 8)>
  
2. Node 4:
   - <4, (0, 1, 6)>
   - <4, (0, 6, 8)>
  
3. Node 6:
   - <6, (0, 4, 7)>
  
4. Node 8:
   - <8, (0, 4, 3)>

[The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 4.]
