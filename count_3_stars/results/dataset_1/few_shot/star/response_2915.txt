Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the unique 3-stars present in the graph. 

Let's go through each node to find the 3-stars:

1. Node 0: <0, (2, 3, 8)>
2. Node 1: No 3-stars can be formed around Node 1 as it connects to only two other nodes.
3. Node 2: <2, (0, 3, 5)> <2, (4, 8, 9)>
4. Node 3: <3, (0, 2, 8)> <3, (1, 5, 9)>
5. Node 4: No 3-stars can be formed around Node 4 as it connects to only one other node.
6. Node 5: <5, (1, 2, 3)> <5, (7, 9, 0)>
7. Node 6: No 3-stars can be formed around Node 6 as it connects to only one other node.
8. Node 7: No 3-stars can be formed around Node 7 as it connects to only two other nodes.
9. Node 8: <8, (0, 2, 3)>
10. Node 9: No 3-stars can be formed around Node 9 as it connects to only two other nodes.

Count of 3-stars: [5]

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (2, 3, 8)>
<2, (0, 3, 5)>
<2, (4, 8, 9)>
<3, (0, 2, 8)>
<5, (1, 2, 3)>
