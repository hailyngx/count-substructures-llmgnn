Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will look for each node that has exactly three neighbors and check if they form a 3-star configuration with the node as the center. 

Let's list down the 3-stars in the graph:

<1, (4, 6, 8)>
<2, (5, 7, 8)>
<3, (5)>
<4, (1, 6, 8)>
<5, (2, 3)>
<6, (4, 7, 8)>
<7, (2, 6, 8)>
<8, (1, 4, 6)>
