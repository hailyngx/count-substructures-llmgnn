Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 7

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 

The <0, (5, 8)> 3-star is present.
The <1, (7, 9)> 3-star is present.
The <2, (7, 8, 9)> 3-star is present.
The <7, (1, 2, 9)> 3-star is present.
The <8, (0, 2, 4)> 3-star is present.
The <9, (1, 2, 7)> 3-star is present.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
