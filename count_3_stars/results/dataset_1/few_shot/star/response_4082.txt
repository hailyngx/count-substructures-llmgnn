Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star pattern. 

We can identify 3-stars by looking at each node's connections and checking if it forms a star pattern with the node at the center.

Let's list the unique 3-stars found:

<0, (1, 4, 8)>
<1, (0, 2, 4)>
<2, (1, 3, 9)>
<3, (2, 4, 6)>
<4, (1, 3, 8)>
<5, (6, 8, 9)>
<6, (3, 5, 9)>
<9, (3, 5, 7)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we get a total of [8].
