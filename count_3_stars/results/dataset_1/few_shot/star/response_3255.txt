Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Here are the steps to find all the 3-stars:

1. Identify all nodes that have exactly 3 neighbors:
   - Nodes 1, 2, 7, and 9 have exactly 3 neighbors each.

2. For each of these nodes identified in step 1, check if they form a 3-star:
   - Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (0, 4, 5)>
   - Node 2 does not form a 3-star as it has 2 neighbors connected to it.
   - Node 7 does not form a 3-star as it has only 1 neighbor connected to it.
   - Node 9 does not form a 3-star as it has only 2 neighbors connected to it.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1]. The unique 3-star found is <1, (0, 4, 5)>.
