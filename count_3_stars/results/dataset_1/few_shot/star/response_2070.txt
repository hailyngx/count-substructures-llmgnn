Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star.

Looking at the adjacency list, we can see the connections for each node:
- Node 0: (1, 3, 9)
- Node 1: (0, 6)
- Node 2: (3)
- Node 3: (0, 2, 5, 6)
- Node 4: (5, 6, 7, 9)
- Node 5: (3, 4)
- Node 6: (1, 3, 4, 7, 9)
- Node 7: (4, 6, 8, 9)
- Node 8: (7, 9)
- Node 9: (0, 4, 6, 7, 8)

Now, let's identify the unique 3-stars present in the graph:

<0, (1, 3, 9)>
<3, (0, 2, 5)>
<4, (5, 6, 7)>
<6, (1, 3, 7)>
<7, (4, 6, 8)>
<9, (0, 6, 8)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars in the graph, we get [6].
