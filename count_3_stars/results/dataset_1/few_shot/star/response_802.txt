Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 5, 7, and node 8

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph can be determined by finding the 3-stars starting from each node. 

Let's start with node 0: 
- Node 0 is not part of any 3-star.

Node 1:
- Node 1 is part of the following 3-star: <1, (5, 8, 9)>

Node 2:
- Node 2 is part of the following 3-stars: <2, (5, 6, 9)>, <2, (5, 8, 9)>

Node 3:
- Node 3 is not part of any 3-star.

Node 4:
- Node 4 is part of the following 3-star: <4, (3, 8, 9)>

Node 5:
- Node 5 is part of the following 3-stars: <5, (1, 8, 9)>, <5, (2, 8, 9)>

Node 6:
- Node 6 is not part of any 3-star.

Node 7:
- Node 7 is part of the following 3-star: <7, (3, 8, 9)>

Node 8:
- Node 8 is part of the following 3-stars: <8, (1, 5, 9)>, <8, (1, 9, 5)>, <8, (2, 5, 9)>, <8, (2, 9, 5)>, <8, (4, 3, 9)>, <8, (4, 9, 3)>, <8, (5, 1, 9)>, <8, (5, 2, 9)>

Node 9:
- Node 9 is part of the following 3-stars: <9, (1, 5, 8)>, <9, (2, 5, 8)>, <9, (3, 4, 8)>, <9, (7, 3, 8)>, <9, (8, 1, 5)>, <9, (8, 2, 5)>, <9, (8, 4, 3)>, <9, (8, 7, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [16].
The unique 3-stars found are: <1, (5, 8, 9)>, <2, (5, 6, 9)>, <2, (5, 8, 9)>, <4, (3, 8, 9)>, <5, (1, 8, 9)>, <5, (2, 8, 9)>, <7, (3, 8, 9)>, <8, (1, 5, 9)>, <8, (1, 9, 5)>, <8, (2, 5, 9)>, <8, (2, 9, 5)>, <8, (4, 3, 9)>, <8, (4, 9, 3)>, <8, (5, 1, 9)>, <8, (5, 2, 9)>, <9, (1, 5, 8)>, <9, (2, 5, 8)>, <9, (3, 4, 8)>, <9, (7, 3, 8)>, <9, (8, 1, 5)>, <9, (8, 2, 5)>, <9, (8, 4, 3)>, <9, (8, 7, 3)>
