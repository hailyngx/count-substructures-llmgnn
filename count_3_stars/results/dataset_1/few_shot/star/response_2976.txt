Node 3 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to understand that a 3-star involves a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph step by step:

1. Identify nodes with exactly three edges connected:
   - Node 0 has two edges connected.
   - Node 1 has four edges connected.
   - Node 2 has three edges connected.
   - Node 3 has two edges connected.
   - Node 4 has one edge connected.
   - Node 5 has two edges connected.
   - Node 6 has three edges connected.
   - Node 7 has three edges connected.
   - Node 8 has five edges connected.
   - Node 9 has five edges connected.

2. From the adjacency list, we can see that nodes 2, 6, and 7 are the only nodes that have exactly three edges connected.

3. Identify the 3-stars involving nodes 2, 6, and 7:
   - For node 2: (2, 0, 1, 8)
   - For node 6: (6, 1, 5, 8)
   - For node 7: (7, 0, 3, 9)

So, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are:
<2, (0, 1, 8)>
<6, (1, 5, 8)>
<7, (0, 3, 9)>

Count of 3-stars: [3]
