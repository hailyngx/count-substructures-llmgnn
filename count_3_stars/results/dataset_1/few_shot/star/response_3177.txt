Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes (3 leaves) through edges. 

Observing the given graph, we can identify the following 3-star configurations:
<1, (4, 7, 9)>
<6, (0, 1, 3)>
<8, (4, 5, 6)>

However, we also have to account for the reverse configurations yielding the same 3-star graph. For example, <1, (4, 7, 9)> would be the same as <9, (1, 4, 7)>.

When considering both original and reverse configurations, the total count of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
