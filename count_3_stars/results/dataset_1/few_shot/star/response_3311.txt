Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, 7, and node 8

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars. A 3-star graph has a center node connected to exactly three other nodes. Based on the given adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars: 
<0, (1, 2, 6)>
<0, (1, 2, 8)>
<0, (1, 2, 9)>
<0, (1, 6, 9)>
<0, (2, 6, 9)>
<1, (0, 2, 8)>
<2, (0, 1, 8)>
<2, (0, 3, 5)>
<2, (0, 5, 8)>
<2, (1, 3, 5)>
<2, (1, 5, 8)>
<5, (2, 3, 8)>
<5, (2, 3, 8)>

Counting the total number of unique 3-stars gives us:
