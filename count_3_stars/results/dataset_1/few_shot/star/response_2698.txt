Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

In this graph, the nodes that are connected to three other nodes are:
- Node 2: Connected to nodes 3, 4, and 5
- Node 3: Connected to nodes 2, 5, and 8
- Node 4: Connected to nodes 2 and 5
- Node 7: Connected to nodes 5, 6, and 8

We can form 3-stars around these nodes. Let's identify them:

<2, (3, 4, 5)>
<3, (2, 5, 8)>
<4, (2, 5)>
<7, (5, 6, 8)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars: [4].
