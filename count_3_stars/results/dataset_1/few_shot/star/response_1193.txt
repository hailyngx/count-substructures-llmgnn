Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 8

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible 3-stars by looking for nodes that are connected in a star pattern.

We can see that there are two 3-stars in this graph. Let's identify them:

1. <0, (1, 6, 8)>
2. <2, (3, 5, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
