Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 5
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star.

Let's list out the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (2, 3, 8)>
<1, (2, 5, 7)>
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<2, (0, 3, 8)>
<2, (1, 3, 6)>
<2, (1, 6, 8)>
<4, (5, 6, 8)>
<5, (1, 4, 8)>
<6, (2, 4, 7)>
<8, (0, 4, 5)>

Count of 3-stars: [10]
