Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 6, and node 9
