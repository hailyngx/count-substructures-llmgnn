Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 5

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star patterns in the given graph:

1. Node 0: (1, 2, 3)
2. Node 7: (1, 2, 4)
3. Node 5: (0, 3, 6)
4. Node 5: (0, 4, 9)

Based on the provided information, there are **4** unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

Therefore, the answer is **[4]**.

<0, (1, 2, 3)>, <7, (1, 2, 4)>, <5, (0, 3, 6)>, <5, (0, 4, 9)>
