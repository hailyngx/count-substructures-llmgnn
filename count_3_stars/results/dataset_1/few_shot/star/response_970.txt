Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 8

Response:
Let's start by identifying the 3-stars in the given graph. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we can see that the center nodes of potential 3-stars are nodes 0, 3, 4, and 9. We will consider each of these nodes in turn to find the leaves connected to them.

For node 0:
- Connected nodes are 2, 3, 4, 7, and 9. This forms a 3-star with center node 0 and leaves 2, 3, and 9. 
So, <0, (2, 3, 9)>.

For node 3:
- Connected nodes are 0, 7, and 9. This forms a 3-star with center node 3 and leaves 0, 7, and 9. 
So, <3, (0, 7, 9)>.

For node 4:
- Connected nodes are 0, 1, 5, and 6. This could form two 3-stars:
    - One with center node 4 and leaves 0, 1, and 5: <4, (0, 1, 5)>.
    - Another with center node 4 and leaves 0, 6, and 5: <4, (0, 6, 5)>.

For node 9:
- Connected nodes are 0, 2, 3, and 8. This could potentially form one 3-star:
    - One with center node 9 and leaves 0, 2, and 8: <9, (0, 2, 8)>.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4]. 
The unique 3-stars found are <0, (2, 3, 9)>, <3, (0, 7, 9)>, <4, (0, 1, 5)>, <4, (0, 6, 5)>, and <9, (0, 2, 8)>.
