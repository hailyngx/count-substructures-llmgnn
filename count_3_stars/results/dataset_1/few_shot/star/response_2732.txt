Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, and node 8

Response:
After analyzing the given graph, we can identify the 3-stars present in the graph by locating nodes that have exactly three neighbors (excluding the center node). Let's list the unique 3-stars:

<0, (4, 9, -)>
<2, (5, 7, 9)>
<6, (5, 8, 9)>
<9, (0, 2, 4)>

Count of 3-stars: [4]
