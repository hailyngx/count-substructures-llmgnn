Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Given the graph information, we first identify the central nodes (nodes with exactly 3 neighbors) and then find the 3-stars associated with each central node.

From the adjacency list:
- Nodes 3 and 4 are central nodes.

For Node 3:
1. <3, (0, 2, 8)>
2. <3, (0, 2, 5)>
3. <3, (0, 2, 1)>

For Node 4:
4. <4, (1, 5, 8)>

Thus, there are a total of [4] 3-stars in the graph.
