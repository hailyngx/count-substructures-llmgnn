Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 7

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (4, 8, 1)>
<1, (3, 4, 5)>
<1, (4, 0, 8)>
<1, (5, 2, 4)>
<2, (4, 5, 8)>
<3, (1, 4, 6)>
<3, (4, 0, 8)>
<4, (1, 0, 2)>
<4, (2, 5, 8)>
<4, (3, 7, 5)>
<4, (7, 5, 1)>
<4, (8, 0, 2)>
<4, (8, 1, 5)>
<5, (1, 4, 7)>
<5, (2, 4, 8)>
<5, (4, 7, 1)>
<5, (7, 4, 8)>
<6, (3, 7, 8)>
<7, (4, 3, 5)>
<7, (5, 4, 8)>
<8, (0, 4, 5)>
<8, (1, 4, 0)>
<8, (2, 5, 4)>
<8, (4, 0, 1)>
<8, (5, 2, 4)>
<9, (3, 7, 4)>
<9, (7, 4, 5)>

Count of 3-stars: [26]
