Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 4

Response:
First, identify all the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (1, 6, 9)>
<1, (0, 2, 6)>
<2, (3, 5, 9)>
<3, (2, 6, 9)>
<4, (8, 9, x)> (Since node 9 cannot form a 3-star with 4)
<5, (2, 8, x)> (Since node 2 cannot form a 3-star with 5)
<6, (0, 2, 3)>
<7, (3, x, x)> (Since node 3 cannot form a 3-star with 7)
<8, (2, 4, 5)>
<9, (0, 2, 4)>

Count of 3-stars in the graph: [8]
