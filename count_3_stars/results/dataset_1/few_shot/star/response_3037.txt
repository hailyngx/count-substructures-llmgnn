Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 6) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars, we can look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes, which forms a 3-star pattern. Let's find and list the unique 3-stars in this graph:

<0, (1, 3, 6)>
<1, (0, 6, 7)>
<2, (5, 6, 9)>

Finally, we count the total number of 3-stars found in this graph and output it inside brackets []:
