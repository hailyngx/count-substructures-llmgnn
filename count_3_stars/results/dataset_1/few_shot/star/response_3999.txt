Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 4
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify the central nodes and their corresponding leaves.

In this graph, the central nodes are nodes 4, 8, and 9 because they each have exactly 3 adjacent nodes.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars: 
<4, (1, 8, 9)>
<8, (4, 6, 7)>
<9, (4, 8, )>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we find that there are [3] 3-stars in the graph.
