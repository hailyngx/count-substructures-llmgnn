Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 6

Response:
There are <0, (1, 3, 4)>, <3, (0, 2, 4)> and <4, (0, 3, 8)> as 3-stars in this graph.
