Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for each node's neighbors and identify the 3-stars. 

1. For Node 0:
    - <0, (3, 5, 8)>
    
2. For Node 1:
    - <1, (2, 8, 9)>
    
3. For Node 2:
    - <2, (1, 3, 8)>
    
4. For Node 3:
    - <3, (0, 2, 9)>
    
5. For Node 4:
    - No 3-star as it only has 2 neighbors.
    
6. For Node 5:
    - No 3-star as it only has 1 neighbor.
    
7. For Node 6:
    - No 3-star as it only has 2 neighbors.
    
8. For Node 7:
    - No 3-star as it only has 1 neighbor.
    
9. For Node 8:
    - <8, (0, 1, 2)>
    - <8, (6, 9, 1)>
    
10. For Node 9:
    - <9, (1, 2, 3)>
    - <9, (8, 1, 2)>
    - <9, (8, 0, 3)>

Count of 3-stars in the given graph: [7]
