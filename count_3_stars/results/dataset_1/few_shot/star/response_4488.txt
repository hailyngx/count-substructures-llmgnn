Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 7

Response:
The nodes involved in a 3-star in the given graph are:
- Node 0 with neighbors 2, 6, 8
- Node 1 with neighbors 2, 6
- Node 6 with neighbors 0, 1, 9
- Node 4 with neighbors 7, 8, 9

Counting the number of unique 3-stars in the graph:

1. Looking at Node 0:
<0, (2, 6, 8)>
2. Looking at Node 1:
<1, (2, 6)>
3. Looking at Node 6:
<6, (0, 1, 9)>
4. Looking at Node 4:
<4, (7, 8, 9)>

Therefore, there are a total of [4] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
