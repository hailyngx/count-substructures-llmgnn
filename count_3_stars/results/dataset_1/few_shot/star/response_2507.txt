Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify and count them.

The nodes that form 3-stars are:
- 1: (2, 3, 5)
- 3: (1, 5, 7)
- 5: (1, 3, 6)
- 7: (4, 5, 6)
- 8: (2, 3, 7)
- 9: (5, 6)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
Unique 3-stars: 
<1, (2, 3, 5)>
<3, (1, 5, 7)>
<5, (1, 3, 6)>
<7, (4, 5, 6)>
<8, (2, 3, 7)>
<9, (5, 6)>
