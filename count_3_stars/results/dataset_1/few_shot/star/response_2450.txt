Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 3

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with exactly three neighbors to determine potential central nodes for 3-stars:
Nodes 0, 1, and 4 each have three neighbors.

Now, let's examine the neighbors of each of these nodes to find the 3-stars:
For Node 0: (0, 1, 5), (0, 1, 8), (0, 1, 9)
For Node 1: (1, 0, 5), (1, 0, 8), (1, 0, 9)
For Node 4: (4, 5, 7), (4, 5, 8)

Thus, there are a total of <0, (1, 5, 8)>, <1, (0, 5, 8)>, and <4, (5, 7, 8)>.
Counting these unique 3-stars, we get a total of [3].
