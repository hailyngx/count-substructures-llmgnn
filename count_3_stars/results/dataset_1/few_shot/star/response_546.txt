Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a 3-star pattern.

Looking at the graph and adjacency list provided, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<2, (1, 3, 6)>
<3, (0, 2, 6)>
<6, (0, 2, 3)>
<9, (3, 5, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
