Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 6) (3, 0) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify sets of nodes where one node (the center) is connected to exactly three other nodes (leaves) and those three nodes are not directly connected to each other.

Given the adjacency list, let's identify the 3-stars:

<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<1, (0, 5, 6)>
<6, (0, 1, 9)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph [3].
