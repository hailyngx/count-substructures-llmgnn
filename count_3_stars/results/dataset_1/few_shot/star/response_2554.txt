Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 5

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars present in this graph step by step:

1. Nodes connected to exactly three other nodes:
   - Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, 5, and 8. It forms 3-stars with nodes 0, 1, 3, and 5.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in this graph is [4].

Unique 3-star configurations in this graph:
<0, (4, 1, 3)>
<1, (4, 0, 3)>
<3, (4, 0, 6)>
<5, (4, 9, 4)>
