Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars in the graph. A 3-star involves a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

From the given adjacency list, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- For Node 0: <0, (4, 5, 7)>
- For Node 5: <5, (0, 1, 8)>
- For Node 8: <8, (0, 1, 9)>

Counting the unique 3-stars found gives us:
