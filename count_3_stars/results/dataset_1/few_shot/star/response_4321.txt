Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star configuration. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (4, 6, 7)>
<6, (0, 4, 5)>
<6, (0, 5, 7)>
<6, (2, 4, 5)>
<6, (2, 5, 7)>
<6, (4, 5, 7)>

Therefore, there are [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
