Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 7

Response:
Given the information provided, we need to identify the 3-star structures in this graph.

Looking at the adjacency list and the definition of a 3-star graph, we can see that the central node (the center) and the nodes adjacent to it form a 3-star. A 3-star consists of three leaves connected to a central hub.

Let's go through the nodes step by step to count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

Node 0: (1, 5, 8), (1, 5, 9) [2]
Node 1: (0, 4, 5), (0, 5, 8) [2]
Node 2: No 3-star
Node 3: No 3-star
Node 4: (1, 2, 9) [1]
Node 5: (0, 1, 6), (0, 1, 7) [2]
Node 6: No 3-star
Node 7: (3, 5, 9) [1]
Node 8: No 3-star
Node 9: (0, 4, 7) [1]

[Total number of 3-stars: 9]
