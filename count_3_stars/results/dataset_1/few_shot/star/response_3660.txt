Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 24 edges, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph.

Let's examine each node to see if it is the center of a 3-star:

1. Node 0: <0, (3, 5, 7)> [1]
2. Node 1: <1, (3, 7, 0)> [2]
3. Node 2: <2, (3, 4, 0)> [3]
4. Node 3: <3, (0, 1, 2)> [4]
5. Node 4: <4, (2, 8, 0)> [5]
6. Node 5: <5, (0, 6, 0)> [6]
7. Node 6: No 3-star
8. Node 7: <7, (0, 1, 3)> [7]
9. Node 8: <8, (4, 7, 0)> [8]
10. Node 9: No connections, so no 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
Unique 3-stars are: <0, (3, 5, 7)>, <1, (3, 7, 0)>, <2, (3, 4, 0)>, <3, (0, 1, 2)>, <4, (2, 8, 0)>, <5, (0, 6, 0)>, <7, (0, 1, 3)>, <8, (4, 7, 0)>.
