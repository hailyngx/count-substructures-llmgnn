Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, and node 7

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the graph can be found by examining each node and checking if it is the center of a 3-star. 

Let's go through each node:
- Node 0: <0, (5, 6, 7)>
- Node 1: Not a center of a 3-star.
- Node 2: <2, (1, 3, 4)>, <2, (6, 7, 3)>
- Node 3: Not a center of a 3-star.
- Node 4: Not a center of a 3-star.
- Node 5: <5, (0, 9, 7)>
- Node 6: <6, (0, 2, 3)>
- Node 7: <7, (0, 2, 9)>
- Node 8: <8, (0)>
- Node 9: Not a center of a 3-star.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [6]. 
The unique 3-stars are <0, (5, 6, 7)>, <2, (1, 3, 4)>, <2, (6, 7, 3)>, <5, (0, 9, 7)>, <6, (0, 2, 3)>, <7, (0, 2, 9)>.
