Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 3

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are part of 3-stars based on the definition given. 
A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list down the nodes that satisfy this condition:

1. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 8. (2, 0, 4, 8)
2. Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 8. (4, 1, 2, 8)
3. Node 6 is connected to node 4. (6, 4)
4. Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 4. (8, 1, 2, 4)

Now, let's count the unique 3-stars in the graph:
<2, 0, 4, 8>
<4, 1, 2, 8>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
