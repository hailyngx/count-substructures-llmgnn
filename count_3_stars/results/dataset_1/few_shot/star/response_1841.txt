Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be obtained by counting the number of occurrences of a node having 3 edges connected to it in the adjacency list. 

The nodes that have exactly 3 edges connected to it are as follows:
- Node 0
- Node 2
- Node 4
- Node 9

Counting the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- For Node 0: (0, 1, 7)
- For Node 2: (2, 3, 5)
- For Node 4: (4, 1, 3)
- For Node 9: (9, 5) 

Thus, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [4]. 

<0, (1, 7)>
<2, (3, 5)>
<4, (1, 3)>
<9, 5>
