Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 8

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique configurations where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Given the definition of a 3-star graph, we can see that:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star: <0, (2, 4, _)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (4, 5, _)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star: <2, (0, 3, 8)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star: <3, (2, 6, 9)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star: <8, (2, 9, _)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star: <9, (3, 8, _)>

Therefore, there are a total of [6] 3-stars in the graph.
