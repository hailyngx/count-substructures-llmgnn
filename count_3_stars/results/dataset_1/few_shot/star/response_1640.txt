Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 7
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 9
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 7

Response:
Since a 3-star consists of a center node connected to three other nodes, we can identify them in the given graph. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we can determine the following 3-stars:
<0, (1, 5)>
<1, (0, 3, 6)>
<2, (3, 5, 7)>
<3, (1, 2, 7)>
<5, (0, 2, 6)>
<6, (1, 5, 9)>
<7, (2, 3, 9)>
<9, (5, 6, 7)>

Therefore, there are a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
