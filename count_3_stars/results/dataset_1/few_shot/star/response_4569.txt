Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 3

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes with exactly three neighbors, which form the center of the 3-stars. Then we can find the leaves connected to each central node to form the 3-stars. 

Central Nodes:
- Node 0 (Connected to nodes 2, 3, 6)
- Node 3 (Connected to nodes 0, 5, 6)
- Node 6 (Connected to nodes 0, 3, 7)

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (2, 3, 6)>
<3, (0, 5, 6)>
<6, (0, 3, 7)>

There are [3] 3-stars in total.
