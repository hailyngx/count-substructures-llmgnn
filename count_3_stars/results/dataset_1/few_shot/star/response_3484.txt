Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a 3-star pattern. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we can see that nodes 1 and 5 satisfy the conditions of being connected to exactly three other nodes each. Let's list the unique 3-stars:

<1, (3, 4, 7)>
<1, (3, 7, 9)>
<1, (4, 5, 9)>
<5, (4, 6, 7)>
<5, (6, 7, 9)>

Counting the total number of unique 3-stars gives us the final answer: [5].
