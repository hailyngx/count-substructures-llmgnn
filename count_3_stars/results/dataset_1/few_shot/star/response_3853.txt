Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 3

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 6, and 8: <0, (2, 6, 8)>
2. Node 0 forms another 3-star with nodes 2, 8, and 9: <0, (2, 8, 9)>
3. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 6, and 7: <1, (5, 6, 7)>
4. Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 7, and 9: <3, (1, 7, 9)>

Therefore, there are a total of [4] 3-stars in the given graph.
