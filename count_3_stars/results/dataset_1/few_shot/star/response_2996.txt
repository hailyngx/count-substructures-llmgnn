Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 7
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 6

Response:
The 3-star graph structures in the given graph are as follows: 
[5]

<0, (7, 8, 0)>
<1, (7, 9, 1)>
<2, (7, 2, 0)>
<4, (6, 7, 4)>
<6, (5, 9, 6)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
