Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 6, and node 7

Response:
Let's list all possible 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 0: (1, 3, 9)
2. Node 1: (0, 2, 9)
3. Node 3: (0, 4, 6)
4. Node 4: (3, 7, 8)
5. Node 6: (3, 9, 7)
6. Node 7: (4, 8, 9)

Count of 3-stars in the graph: [6]

<0, (1, 3, 9)>
<1, (0, 2, 9)>
<3, (0, 4, 6)>
<4, (3, 7, 8)>
<6, (3, 9, 7)>
<7, (4, 8, 9)>
