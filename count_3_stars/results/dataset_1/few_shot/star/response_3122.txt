Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through the adjacency list to find these 3-stars:

1. Node 0: <0, (1, 4, 6)>
2. Node 1: <1, (0, 2, 3)>
3. Node 2: No 3-star.
4. Node 3: No 3-star.
5. Node 4: No 3-star.
6. Node 5: No 3-star.
7. Node 6: <6, (0, 1, 2)> and <6, (4, 5, 7)>
8. Node 7: <7, (2, 4, 6)> and <7, (5, 8, 9)>
9. Node 8: No 3-star.
10. Node 9: No 3-star.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<6, (0, 1, 2)>
<6, (4, 5, 7)>
<7, (2, 4, 6)>
<7, (5, 8, 9)>
