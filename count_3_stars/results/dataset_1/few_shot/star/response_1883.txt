Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes (forming a 3-star pattern). 

Looking at the adjacency list for each node, we can identify the following 3-stars:
- <0, (3, 4, 7)>
- <2, (1, 5, 6)>
- <5, (1, 2, 6)>
- <7, (0, 2, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4]. 

<List of unique 3-stars: <0, (3, 4, 7)>, <2, (1, 5, 6)>, <5, (1, 2, 6)>, <7, (0, 2, 9)>]
