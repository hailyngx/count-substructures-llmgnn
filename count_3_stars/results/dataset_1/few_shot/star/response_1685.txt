Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

From the given adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<2, (0, 1, 4)>
<4, (0, 1, 5)>
<6, (0, 1, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
