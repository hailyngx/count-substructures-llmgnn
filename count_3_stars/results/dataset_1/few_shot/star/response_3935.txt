Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

In this particular graph:
- Node 0 is connected to 3 nodes: 3, 8, and 9 
- Node 1 is connected to 4 nodes: 3, 4, 6, and 8 
- Node 2 is connected to 2 nodes: 6, and 8 
- Node 3 is connected to 3 nodes: 0, 1, and 9 
- Node 4 is connected to 2 nodes: 1, and 5 
- Node 5 is connected to 2 nodes: 4, and 7 
- Node 6 is connected to 2 nodes: 1, and 2 
- Node 7 is connected to 2 nodes: 5, and 9 
- Node 8 is connected to 3 nodes: 0, 1, and 2 
- Node 9 is connected to 3 nodes: 0, 3, and 7

From this information, we can see that the 3-stars in this graph are as follows:
- <0, (3, 8, 9)>
- <1, (3, 4, 8)>
- <2, (6, 8)>
- <3, (0, 1, 9)>
- <8, (0, 1, 2)>
- <9, (0, 3, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
