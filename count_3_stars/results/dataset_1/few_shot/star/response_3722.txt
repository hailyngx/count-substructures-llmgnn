Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star. 

The 3-stars in the graph can be represented as follows:
<0, (1, 4, 0)>
<1, (0, 4, 7)>
<1, (3, 4, 1)>
<1, (6, 1, 7)>
<3, (1, 4, 3)>
<3, (4, 8, 3)>
<4, (0, 7, 4)>
<4, (3, 8, 4)>
<5, (3, 9, 5)>

Counting these unique 3-stars, we find that there are a total of [9] 3-stars in the graph.
