Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, 7, and node 8
