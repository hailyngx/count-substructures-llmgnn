Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the 3-stars. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 0: (0, 6, 8)
2. Node 1: (1, 4, 6)
3. Node 2: (2, 5, 8)
4. Node 5: (5, 2, 7)
5. Node 6: (6, 0, 1)
6. Node 7: (7, 2, 6)
7. Node 8: (8, 0, 2)
8. Node 9: (9, 3, 5)

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [8]. 

Unique 3-stars: 
<0, (6, 8)>
<1, (4, 6)>
<2, (5, 8)>
<5, (2, 7)>
<6, (0, 1)>
<7, (2, 6)>
<8, (0, 2)>
<9, (3, 5)>
