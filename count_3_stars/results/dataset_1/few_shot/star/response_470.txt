Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 4
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a 3-star pattern.

In the given graph, we have the following 3-stars:
<2, (7, 8, 9)>
<3, (5, 7, 9)>
<7, (2, 8, 9)>
<8, (2, 7, 9)>
<9, (3, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
