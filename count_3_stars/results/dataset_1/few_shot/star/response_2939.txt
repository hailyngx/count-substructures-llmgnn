Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 5

Response:
There are a total of [2] 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (2, 3, 8)>
<3, (0, 4, 5)>
