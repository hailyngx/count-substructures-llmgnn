Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the adjacency list provided, we can see that nodes 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 have connections to exactly three other nodes each. 

1. For Node 0:
<0, (4, 6, 7)>
<0, (4, 6, 8)>
<0, (4, 7, 8)>
So, Node 0 contributes 3 3-stars.

2. For Node 2:
<2, (3, 4, 6)>
<2, (3, 6, 8)>
So, Node 2 contributes 2 3-stars.

3. For Node 4:
<4, (0, 2, 3)>
<4, (0, 3, 6)>
<4, (2, 3, 6)>
<4, (0, 6, 7)>
So, Node 4 contributes 4 3-stars.

4. For Node 6:
<6, (0, 2, 4)>
So, Node 6 contributes 1 3-star.

5. For Node 8:
<8, (0, 2, 7)>
So, Node 8 contributes 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [(3 + 2 + 4 + 1 + 1) = 11].
