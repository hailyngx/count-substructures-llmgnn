Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 5

Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star, which consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's go through the nodes and their connections to find 3-stars:
1. Node 0 is not a part of any 3-star.
2. Node 1 is not a part of any 3-star.
3. Node 2 is not a part of any 3-star.
4. Node 3 is not a part of any 3-star.
5. Node 4 is not a part of any 3-star.
6. Node 5 is a part of the following 3-stars:
    - <5, (0, 1, 2)>
7. Node 6 is not a part of any 3-star.
8. Node 7 is not a part of any 3-star.
9. Node 8 is not a part of any 3-star.
10. Node 9 is not a part of any 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1].

The unique 3-star found in the graph is: 
<5, (0, 1, 2)>
