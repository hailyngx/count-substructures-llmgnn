Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 5

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are as follows: 

<0, (3, 7, 8)>
<0, (3, 7, 9)>
<0, (3, 8, 9)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
