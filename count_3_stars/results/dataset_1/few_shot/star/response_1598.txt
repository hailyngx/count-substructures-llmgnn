Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, one can identify them by looking for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

The 3-stars in the given graph are:
<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<1, (0, 3, 6)>
<2, (3, 7, 8)>
<3, (1, 2, 4)>
<4, (3, 8, None)>
<5, (0, 8, None)>
<7, (2, 8, 9)>
<8, (3, 4, 5)>
<9, (7, 8, None)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
