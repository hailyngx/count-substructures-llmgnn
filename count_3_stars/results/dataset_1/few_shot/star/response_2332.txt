Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 2

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes (forming a 3-star pattern).

Looking at the provided information and adjacency lists, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<0, (3, 6, 9)>
<0, (5, 6, 9)>
<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<1, (2, 6, 7)>
<1, (4, 6, 7)>
<2, (1, 4, 6)>
<2, (1, 6, 7)>
<2, (4, 6, 7)>
<4, (1, 2, 6)>
<4, (1, 6, 7)>
<4, (2, 6, 7)>
<6, (0, 1, 2)>
<6, (0, 2, 3)>
<6, (0, 3, 4)>
<6, (1, 2, 4)>
<6, (1, 4, 7)>
<6, (2, 4, 7)>

Counting all the unique 3-stars listed above, we find that there are [18] 3-stars in the given graph.
