Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. These instances represent 3-stars with that particular node as the center.

Here are the 3-stars found in the graph:
[7]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1].
