Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a star pattern. 

Looking at the adjacency list and the given edges, we can list the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (4, 7, 8)>
<0, (4, 6, 7)>
<0, (6, 7, 8)>

Concluding, there are [3] 3-stars in the graph.
