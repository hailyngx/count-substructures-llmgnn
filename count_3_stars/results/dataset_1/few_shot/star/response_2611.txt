Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars present in the graph. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Here are the 3-stars found in the given graph along with their central node and leaf nodes:

<0, (2, 3, 5)>
<0, (2, 3, 9)>
<0, (2, 5, 9)>
<0, (3, 5, 8)>
<0, (3, 5, 9)>
<0, (5, 8, 9)>
<3, (0, 2, 5)>
<3, (0, 5, 8)>
<4, (6, 7, 8)>
<4, (6, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
