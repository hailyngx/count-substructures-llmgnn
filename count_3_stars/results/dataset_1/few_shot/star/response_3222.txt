Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 8

Response:
The central node of a 3-star graph can have 1, 2, or 3 neighbors. Let's analyze each node to identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 0: Not a central node of any 3-star.
2. Node 1: Not connected to any other nodes, so it cannot be the center of a 3-star.
3. Node 2: Connected to node 3 and 8. Possible 3-star: <2, (3, 8)>
4. Node 3: Connected to node 2 and 9. Possible 3-star: <3, (2, 9)>
5. Node 4: Connected to node 8. Not a central node of any 3-star.
6. Node 5: Connected to node 0. Not a central node of any 3-star.
7. Node 6: Not connected to any other nodes, so it cannot be the center of a 3-star.
8. Node 7: Connected to node 8 and 9. Possible 3-star: <7, (8, 9)>
9. Node 8: Connected to node 0, 2, 4, 7, and 9. Possible 3-stars: <8, (0, 2, 4)>, <8, (0, 2, 7)>, <8, (0, 2, 9)>, <8, (2, 4, 7)>, <8, (2, 7, 9)>, <8, (4, 7, 9)>
10. Node 9: Connected to node 3, 7, and 8. Possible 3-stars: <9, (3, 7, 8)>

Total number of 3-stars: 12
