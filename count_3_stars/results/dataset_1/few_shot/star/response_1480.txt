Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list the 3-stars present in the graph:

<0, (6, 8, 9)>
<1, (2, 3, 9)>
<2, (1, 5, 8)>
<5, (2, 6, 7)>
<7, (2, 5, 6)>
<9, (0, 1, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
