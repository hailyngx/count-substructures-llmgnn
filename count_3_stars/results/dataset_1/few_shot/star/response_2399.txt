Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 3

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify all nodes that have exactly 3 edges connected to them. These nodes will serve as potential centers of 3-stars.

2. For each potential center node, check the nodes that are connected to it by an edge. If the neighboring nodes of the potential center form a 3-star pattern, we count it as a 3-star.

Let's follow the steps:

1. Potential center nodes: Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 have exactly 3 edges connected to them.
   
2. For Node 0:
   - <0, (7, 9)> is a 3-star.

3. For Node 1:
   - <1, (3, 4, 8)> is a 3-star.

4. For Node 2:
   - No 3-star can form with Node 2 as the center, as it is connected to only 2 other nodes.

5. For Node 3:
   - <3, (1, 4, 9)> is a 3-star.

Following the steps above, we have found all possible 3-stars in the given graph: <0, (7, 9)>, <1, (3, 4, 8)>, and <3, (1, 4, 9)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
