Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we can identify the unique 3-stars by finding nodes that are part of a 3-star configuration. Since a 3-star graph has a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges, we can iterate through each node and check if it forms a 3-star.

Here are the unique 3-stars in the given graph:
<0, (2, 4, 7)>
<1, (2, 5, 6)>
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<4, (0, 2, 7)>
<6, (1, 8, 9)>
<7, (0, 4, 9)>
<8, (6, 4, 9)>

[The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 7.]
