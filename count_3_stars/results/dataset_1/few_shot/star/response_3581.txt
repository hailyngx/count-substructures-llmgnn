Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 2) (7, 1) (8, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 4
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible combinations where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star pattern.

From the given information, we can first identify the nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them. These nodes can potentially be the centers of 3-stars.

In this graph:
- Node 0 has 4 edges (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5)
- Node 4 has 2 edges (4, 0), (4, 8)
- Node 2 has 2 edges (2, 0), (2, 6)
- Node 1 has 2 edges (1, 3), (1, 7)

Therefore, the potential center nodes for 3-stars are nodes 0, 4, 2, and 1.

Next, we need to check for each potential center node, whether the three neighboring nodes form a 3-star or not.

For Node 0:
- <0, (2, 3, 4)>
- <0, (2, 3, 5)>
These are the two 3-stars with Node 0 as the center.

For Node 4:
There are no 3-stars with Node 4 as the center as it only has 2 edges.

For Node 2:
There are no 3-stars with Node 2 as the center as it only has 2 edges.

For Node 1:
- <1, (3, 0, 7)>
This is the 3-star with Node 1 as the center.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3]. The unique 3-stars are <0, (2, 3, 4)>, <0, (2, 3, 5)>, and <1, (3, 0, 7)>.
