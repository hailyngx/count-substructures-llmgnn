Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, and node 7

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph.

[4]

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (2, 5, 6)>
<2, (0, 1, 4)>
<2, (1, 4, 6)>
<6, (0, 2, 3)>
