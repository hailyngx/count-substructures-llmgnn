Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 5, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Based on the provided information, the 3-stars in the given graph are as follows:
<1, (3, 6, 8)>
<1, (3, 6, 9)>
<1, (3, 8, 9)>
<3, (1, 4, 9)>
<3, (1, 5, 9)>
<6, (0, 1, 8)>
<9, (1, 4, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
