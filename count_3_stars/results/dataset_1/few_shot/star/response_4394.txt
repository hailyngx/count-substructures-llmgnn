Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 2

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars present in the given graph:

1. From the adjacency list, we can see the nodes that are connected to exactly 3 other nodes: Node 1, Node 2, Node 3, Node 6, and Node 7.

2. Let's list the 3-stars:
   <1, (2, 3, 6)>
   <1, (2, 3, 9)>
   <1, (3, 6, 8)>
   <1, (3, 6, 9)>
   <2, (1, 3, 6)>
   <2, (1, 3, 9)>
   <2, (3, 5, 7)>
   <2, (3, 6, 7)>
   <2, (3, 6, 9)>
   <3, (1, 2, 5)>
   <3, (1, 2, 6)>
   <3, (2, 5, 7)>
   <3, (2, 6, 7)>
   <6, (1, 2, 3)>
   <6, (1, 3, 8)>
   <6, (2, 3, 7)>

3. Count of 3-stars: [16]
