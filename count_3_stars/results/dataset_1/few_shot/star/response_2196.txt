Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to three other nodes forming a 3-star pattern. 

Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (6, 7)>  
<1, (5, 6)>  
<2, (5, 6)>  
<3, (4, 5, 6)>  
<5, (1, 2, 3)>  
<6, (0, 1, 2)>  
<7, (0, 6)>  

Therefore, there are a total of [7] 3-stars in the given graph.
