Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern.

Here are the identified 3-stars in the given graph:
<1, (0, 2, 9)>
<1, (2, 5, 8)>
<1, (8, 3, 9)>
<1, (2, 5, 8)>
<2, (1, 5, 8)>
<2, (5, 4, 8)>
<3, (7, 8, 9)>
<4, (0, 5, 9)>
<5, (2, 4, 7)>
<6, (7, 8, 9)>
<7, (3, 5, 6)>
<8, (1, 2, 6)>
<9, (1, 3, 6)>
<9, (3, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
