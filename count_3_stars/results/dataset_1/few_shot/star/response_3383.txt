Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 1

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Based on the given information, the 3-stars in this graph can be represented as follows:
<0, (2, 4, 8)>
<0, (2, 4, 9)>
<0, (2, 8, 9)>
<0, (4, 8, 9)>
<1, (6, 7, 9)>
<2, (0, 4, 6)>
<4, (0, 2, 8)>
<4, (0, 3, 8)>
<4, (0, 7, 8)>
<4, (2, 3, 5)>
<4, (2, 5, 7)>
<4, (3, 5, 7)>
<7, (1, 4, 5)>
<8, (0, 3, 4)>
<9, (0, 1, 9)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-star patterns: [15]
