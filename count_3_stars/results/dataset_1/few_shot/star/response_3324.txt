Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 1
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7

Response:
We can identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph by looking for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through each node to find the 3-stars:

- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 8, and 9: <1, (5, 8, 9)>
- Node 2 does not form a 3-star because it is connected to 4 nodes.
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 7, and 9: <3, (2, 7, 9)>
- Node 4 does not form a 3-star because it is only connected to node 2.
- Node 5 does not form a 3-star because it is only connected to node 1.
- Node 6 does not form a 3-star because it is not connected to any other nodes.
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 3, and 9: <7, (2, 3, 9)>
- Node 8 does not form a 3-star because it is connected to 4 nodes.
- Node 9 does not form a 3-star because it is connected to 4 nodes.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are <1, (5, 8, 9)> and <3, (2, 7, 9)>. The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
