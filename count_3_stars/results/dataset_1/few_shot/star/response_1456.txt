Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star structure.

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph step by step:

1. Determine which nodes serve as the center of potential 3-stars by checking if they are connected to exactly three other nodes.

    - Nodes 0, 1, 4, and 5 do not have degree equal to 3, so they cannot be the center of a 3-star.
    
    - Nodes 2, 6, 7, and 9 have degree 5, so they may be the center of a 3-star.
    
    - Nodes 3 and 8 have degree 5, so they may also be the center of a 3-star.

2. For each potential center, check the connections to identify if they form a 3-star structure.

- For node 2: (1, 3, 4), (1, 3, 7), (1, 4, 7), (3, 4, 7)
- For node 6: (0, 8, 3), (3, 8, 9)
- For node 7: (0, 8, 2), (2, 8, 4)
- For node 9: (3, 8, 5)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].

Unique 3-stars identified in the graph:
<2, (1, 3, 4)>
<2, (1, 3, 7)>
<2, (1, 4, 7)>
<2, (3, 4, 7)>
<6, (0, 3, 8)>
<6, (3, 8, 9)>
<7, (0, 2, 8)>
