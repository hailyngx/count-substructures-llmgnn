Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 8

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have exactly 3 neighbors, which are potential central nodes of 3-stars. These nodes are: 0, 2, 3, 6, and 7.

- For node 0: <0, (1, 5, 8)>
- For node 2: <2, (1, 3, 4)>
- For node 3: <3, (2, 4, 6)>
- For node 6: <6, (1, 4, 5)>

There are four unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
