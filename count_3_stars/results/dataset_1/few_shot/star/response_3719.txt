Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 4, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 8

Response:
The 3-star subgraphs in the given graph are as follows:  

<0, (5, 6, 8)>  
<1, (2, 9, -)>  
<2, (1, 4, 5)>  
<4, (2, 6, -)>  
<5, (0, 2, 7)>  
<6, (0, 4, 7)>  
<7, (2, 5, 8)>  
<8, (0, 6, 7)>  
<9, (1, 6, 8)>  

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
