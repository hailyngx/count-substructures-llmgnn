Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 4

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Based on the given edges and adjacency list, let's list down the 3-stars:

<0, (1, 8, 0)>
<1, (0, 8, 1)>
<3, (5, 6, 7)>
<4, (2, 9, 4)>
<4, (8, 9, 4)>
<5, (3, 8, 5)>
<7, (8, 3, 7)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars: [7]
