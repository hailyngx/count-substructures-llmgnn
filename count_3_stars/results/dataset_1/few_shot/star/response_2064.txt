Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern, indicating the center node and its connected leaves.

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<3, (4, 6, 8)>
<4, (0, 3, 7)>
<5, (0, 2, 7)>
<7, (0, 4, 5)>
<7, (2, 4, 9)>

Count the number of unique 3-stars: [6].
