Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 7, and node 8

Response:
There are <1, (3, 4, 6)>, <2, (3, 5, 6)>, and <5, (2, 4, 6)> as the only 3-stars in this graph. 
So, the total number of 3-stars is [3].
