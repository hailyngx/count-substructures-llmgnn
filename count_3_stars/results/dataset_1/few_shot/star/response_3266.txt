Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 6

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- <0, (1, 4, 9)>
- <1, (0, 3, 7)>
- <2, (3, 6, 9)>
- <3, (1, 2, 7)>
- <6, (2, 3, 9)>
- <7, (1, 3, 8)>
- <9, (0, 2, 6)>

Counting the number of 3-stars in the graph, we find a total of [7].
