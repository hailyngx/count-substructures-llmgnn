Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 8

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify cases where a node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes forming a 3-star pattern.

Looking at the adjacency list for each node:
- Node 0 is not part of any 3-star as it is connected to 3 nodes but not in the 3-star pattern.
- Node 1 is part of a 3-star with nodes 0, 2, and 6. 
- Node 2 is part of a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, and 7.
- Node 3 is not part of any 3-star as it is connected to 4 nodes.
- Node 4 is not part of any 3-star as it is connected to 3 nodes but not in the 3-star pattern.
- Node 5 is not part of any 3-star as it is connected to 3 nodes but not in the 3-star pattern.
- Node 6 is part of two 3-stars: one with nodes 1, 3, and 7, and another with nodes 4, 8, and 9.
- Node 7 is not part of any 3-star as it is connected to 3 nodes but not in the 3-star pattern.
- Node 8 is not part of any 3-star as it is connected to 4 nodes.
- Node 9 is not part of any 3-star as it is connected to 4 nodes.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the graph are:
<1, (0, 2, 6)>
<2, (0, 1, 7)>
<6, (1, 3, 7)>
<6, (4, 8, 9)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
