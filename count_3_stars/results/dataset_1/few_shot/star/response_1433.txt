Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 6

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the given graph.

- From the adjacency list, we see that Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, 8, and 9. This means that Node 0 forms 3-stars with (1, 2, 4), (1, 8, 0), and (0, 9, 0).
- Node 1 forms 3-stars with (0, 1, 8) and (1, 6, 7).
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with (0, 2, 7).
- Node 3 forms 3-stars with (1, 3, 6) and (0, 3, 9).
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with (0, 4, 6).
- Node 6 forms 3-stars with (1, 6, 7) and (0, 6, 9).
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with (1, 7, 8).
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with (0, 8, 1).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9]. 
Unique 3-stars found: 
<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<0, (1, 8, 0)>
<0, (0, 9, 0)>
<1, (0, 1, 8)>
<1, (1, 6, 7)>
<2, (0, 2, 7)>
<3, (1, 3, 6)>
<0, (0, 3, 9)>
<0, (0, 4, 6)>
<0, (6, 9, 0)>
<1, (1, 7, 8)>
