Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star in the graph. 

Upon analyzing the given graph, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (6, 7, 8)>
<1, (3, 8, 2)>
<2, (3, 8, 1)>
<3, (1, 2, 4)>
<3, (1, 2, 5)>
<3, (4, 7, 5)>
<3, (5, 6, 7)>
<6, (0, 5, 8)>
<7, (0, 4, 9)>
<8, (0, 1, 6)>
<9, (5, 7, 4)>

Count of unique 3-stars: 11
Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [11].
