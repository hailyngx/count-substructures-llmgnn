Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a 3-star pattern.

Let's start by listing the 3-stars we find:
<0, (2, 3, 7)>
<3, (0, 2, 8)>
<7, (0, 6, 8)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-star patterns in the given graph:
