Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<2, (0, 3, 6)>
<4, (0, 6, 8)>
<8, (3, 4, 5)>

Count of 3-stars: [4]
