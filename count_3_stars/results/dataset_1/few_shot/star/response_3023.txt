Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1

Response:
The given graph has a total of [9] 3-stars. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 4, 7)>
<1, (3, 4, 9)>
<2, (0, 4, 8)>
<2, (4, 7, 8)>
<3, (1, 4, 6)>
<3, (4, 6, 7)>
<3, (4, 6, 8)>
<4, (2, 3, 6)>
<4, (3, 6, 7)>
