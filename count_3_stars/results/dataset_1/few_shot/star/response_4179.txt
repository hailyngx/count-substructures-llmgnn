Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 4, 8)>
<0, (1, 6, 8)>
<1, (2, 4, 9)>
<1, (2, 5, 8)>
<1, (5, 8, 9)>
<2, (4, 8, 9)>
