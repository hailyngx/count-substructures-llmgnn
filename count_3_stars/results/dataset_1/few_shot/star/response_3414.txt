Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 2

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify the 3-stars present. 

The 3-stars in the graph are as follows:
<1, (2, 3, 5)>
<2, (1, 3, 5)>
<3, (1, 2, 7)>
<5, (1, 2, 4)>
<7, (3, 4, 8)>
<8, (0, 2, 7)>
<9, (1, 2)>

Now, we can count the total number of 3-stars in the graph. 
There are a total of [7] 3-stars.
