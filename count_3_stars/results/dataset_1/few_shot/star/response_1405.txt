Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 4

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 9, 2)>
<2, (4, 6, 7)>
<4, (2, 5, 9)>
<5, (3, 4, 7)>
<6, (2, 7, 8)>
<7, (1, 5, 6)>
