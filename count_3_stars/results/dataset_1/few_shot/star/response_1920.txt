Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 2) (8, 2) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 1

Response:
Let's analyze the graph to identify the 3-stars:

- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, and 6: <0, (1, 3, 6)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 2, and 9: <1, (0, 2, 9)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 6, and 7: <2, (1, 6, 7)>
- Node 3 does not form a 3-star since it has only two edges.
- Node 4 does not form a 3-star since it has only one edge.
- Node 5 does not form a 3-star since it has only one edge.
- Node 6 does not form a 3-star since it has only two edges.
- Node 7 does not form a 3-star since it has only one edge.
- Node 8 does not form a 3-star since it has only one edge.
- Node 9 does not form a 3-star since it has only one edge.

Therefore, there are 3 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
So, the final answer is [3].
