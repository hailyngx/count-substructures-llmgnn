Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for each node that has exactly three neighbors and check if it forms a 3-star. 

Let's analyze the nodes:
- Node 0: Does not have exactly three neighbors.
- Node 1: Forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 4, and 8. <1, (2, 4, 8)>
- Node 2: Does not have exactly three neighbors.
- Node 3: Does not have exactly three neighbors.
- Node 4: Does not have exactly three neighbors.
- Node 5: Does not have exactly three neighbors.
- Node 6: Forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 3, and 7. <6, (0, 3, 7)>
- Node 7: Does not have exactly three neighbors.
- Node 8: Does not have exactly three neighbors.
- Node 9: Is not connected to any other nodes.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2]. 
The unique 3-star configurations are <1, (2, 4, 8)> and <6, (0, 3, 7)>.
