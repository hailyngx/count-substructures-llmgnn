Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 7

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that has exactly three neighbors that are connected to it. Let's find the 3-stars:

<0, (6, 7, 8)>
<1, (3, 6, 4)>
<2, (3, 5, 1)>
<3, (1, 2, 8)>
<4, (3, 6, 9)>
<5, (2, 7, 0)>
<6, (0, 1, 4)>
<7, (0, 5, 6)>
<8, (0, 3, 9)>
<9, (7, 8, 0)>

Count of 3-stars: 9
Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
