Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (6, 1) (7, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 4
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify the 3-stars. Since a 3-star consists of the center node and three connected leaves, we can find them by checking each node in the graph for their connections.

From the adjacency list provided, we can identify the following 3-stars:

<1, (0, 5, 6)>
<2, (1, 4, 5)>
<4, (2, 3, 7)>

Count of 3-stars: [3]
