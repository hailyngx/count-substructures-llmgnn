Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (3, 5, 7)>
<0, (3, 5, 8)>
<0, (3, 7, 8)>
<1, (5, 6, 9)>
<3, (0, 5, 7)>
<3, (0, 5, 8)>
<4, (3, 6, 9)>
<5, (0, 3, 7)>
<5, (0, 3, 8)>
<5, (0, 7, 8)>
<9, (1, 4, 8)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars in the given graph:
