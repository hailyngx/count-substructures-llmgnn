Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (8, 0) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 6
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 3

Response:
First, let's find all the 3-stars in the given graph. 
We will look for all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Starting from Node 0:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1 and 8. Since it is not connected to exactly three nodes, Node 0 does not form a 3-star.

Moving to Node 1:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 6. This forms a 3-star: <1, (0, 3, 6)>.

Moving to Node 2:
- Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes and thus does not form a 3-star.

Moving to Node 3:
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 9. This forms a 3-star: <3, (1, 4, 9)>.

Moving to Node 4:
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 3 and 6. Since it is not connected to exactly three nodes, Node 4 does not form a 3-star.

Nodes 5, 7, and 9 are not connected to exactly three other nodes and do not form 3-stars.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
The unique 3-stars found are <1, (0, 3, 6)> and <3, (1, 4, 9)>.
