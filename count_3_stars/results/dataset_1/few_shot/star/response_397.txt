Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will serve as the center of the 3-stars. 

By examining the given information, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (5, 6, 9)>
<2, (4, 6, 9)>
<3, (4, 5, 9)>
<4, (2, 5, 9)>
<5, (0, 3, 7)>
<6, (0, 4, 7)>
<7, (1, 5, 6)>
<9, (0, 2, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
