Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 8

Response:
Let's first identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (2, 4, 9)>
<1, (3, 8, 9)>
<2, (0, 3, 8)>
<3, (1, 2, 6)>
<4, (0, 5, 9)>
<5, (4, 6, 8)>
<6, (3, 5, 7)>
<7, (4, 5, 8)>
<8, (1, 2, 9)>
<9, (0, 4, 8)>

Now let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph: [10]
