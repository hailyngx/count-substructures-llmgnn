Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the 3-stars. 

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (3, 7)>
<1, (2, 3, 5)>
<2, (1, 3, 5)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<3, (2, 5, 7)>
<4, (5, 6)>
<5, (2, 3, 4)>
<6, (4, 7, 9)>
<7, (0, 3, 6)>
<7, (3, 6, 9)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we get a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
