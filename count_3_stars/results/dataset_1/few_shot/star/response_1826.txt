Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (8, 4) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 3

Response:
The 3-star in this graph can be counted by finding all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list them:

<0, (3, 6, 9)>
<3, (0, 6, 9)>
<4, (1, 8, 5)>
<5, (2, 6, 4)>
<6, (0, 5, 3)>
<9, (3, 0, 8)>

Since each unique 3-star has been listed once, the final count is [6].
