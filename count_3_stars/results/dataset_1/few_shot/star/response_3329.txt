Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-star graphs in the provided graph, we need to identify all instances where one node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the adjacency list provided, we can see that the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes are:
- Node 0: connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, 5
- Node 1: connected to nodes 2, 7, 8
- Node 2: connected to nodes 0, 1, 5, 8
- Node 3: connected to nodes 0, 6, 9
- Node 4: connected to nodes 0, 7, 8
- Node 5: connected to nodes 0, 2, 6
- Node 6: connected to nodes 3, 5, 7
- Node 7: connected to nodes 1, 4, 6, 8
- Node 8: connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, 7, 9
- Node 9: connected to nodes 0, 3, 8

Now, let's identify the total number of unique 3-stars in the provided graph:
[<0, (2, 3, 4)>, <0, (2, 3, 5)>, <0, (2, 4, 5)>, <2, (0, 1, 8)>, <3, (0, 6, 9)>, <4, (0, 7, 8)>, <8, (1, 2, 4)>]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
