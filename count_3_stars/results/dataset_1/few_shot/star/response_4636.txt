Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph, we need to find each unique instance of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

From the adjacency list:
- Node 0 is a center in three 3-stars: <0, (4, 6, 8)>, <0, (4, 6, 9)>, <0, (6, 8, 9)>
- Node 3 is a center in one 3-star: <3, (1, 2, 4)>
- Node 4 is a center in one 3-star: <4, (0, 1, 6)>
- Node 5 is a center in one 3-star: <5, (7, 9)>
- Node 6 is a center in one 3-star: <6, (0, 4, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [6].
