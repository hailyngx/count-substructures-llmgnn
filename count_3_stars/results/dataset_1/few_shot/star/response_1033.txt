Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the 3-stars present.

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (2, 7, 9)>
<2, (0, 6, 8)>
<4, (6, 8, 8)>
<8, (2, 4, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
