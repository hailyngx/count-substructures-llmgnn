Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 7

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (4, 7, 9)>
<2, (7, 9, 6)>
<3, (6, 8, 9)>
<3, (6, 9, 4)>
<7, (1, 2, 4)>
<7, (2, 9, 6)>
