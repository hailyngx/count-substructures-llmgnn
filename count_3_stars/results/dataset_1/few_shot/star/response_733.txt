Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to find all unique instances of 3-stars. Here is the list of unique 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (5, 8, 1)>
<1, (5, 6, 8)>
<6, (1, 5, 7)>
<8, (0, 1, 5)>
<8, (5, 6, 7)>
<8, (5, 9, 4)>

Now, counting the total number of 3-stars in the graph:
[6]
