Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 7

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the 3-stars present.

In a 3-star graph, each 3-star will have one central node connected to exactly three other nodes (leaves). 

Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph. Below are the 3-stars found:

<0, (4, 9)>
<1, (6, 8)>
<2, (3, 7)>
<6, (1, 7, 8)>
<7, (2, 6, 9)>
<8, (1, 6)>
<9, (0, 3, 7)>

Thus, there are a total of [7] 3-stars in the given graph.
