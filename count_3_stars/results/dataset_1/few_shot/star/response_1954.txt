Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for each possible 3-star configuration. Remember that a 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes. Here is how we can find them:

1. Look for nodes with exactly three neighbors. These nodes would serve as the centers of the 3-stars.
2. For each such node, check if its neighbors form a 3-star configuration around it.

Let's go step by step:

Nodes that have exactly three neighbors:
- Node 0 (connected to nodes 3, 4, 5, and 8)
- Node 1 (connected to nodes 2, 8, and 9)
- Node 2 (connected to nodes 1, 4, and 5)
- Node 3 (connected to nodes 0, 4, and 7)
- Node 5 (connected to nodes 0, 2, and 4)
- Node 8 (connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, and 6)

Checking for 3-star configurations:
- Node 0 is the center of the 3-star with nodes 3, 4, and 5. <0, (3, 4, 5)>
- Node 1 is the center of the 3-star with nodes 2, 8, and 9. <1, (2, 8, 9)>
- Node 2 is the center of the 3-star with nodes 1, 4, and 5. <2, (1, 4, 5)>
- Node 4 is the center of the 3-star with nodes 0, 2, and 5. <4, (0, 2, 5)>
- Node 8 is the center of the 3-star with nodes 0, 1, and 4. <8, (0, 1, 4)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (3, 4, 5)>, <1, (2, 8, 9)>, <2, (1, 4, 5)>, <4, (0, 2, 5)>, <8, (0, 1, 4)>.
