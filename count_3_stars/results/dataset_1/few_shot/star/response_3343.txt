Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 0) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can consider each node as a potential center of a 3-star and check its adjacent nodes to form stars. 

Looking at the adjacency list for each node, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (1, 3, 6)>
<1, (0, 8, 9)>
<3, (0, 4, 9)>
<5, (2, 4, 9)>
<9, (1, 3, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
