Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify and count the 3-stars in the graph.

The possible 3-stars in the graph are as follows:
<0, (1, 6, 7)>  
<0, (1, 7, 9)>  
<0, (6, 7, 9)>  
<1, (0, 3, 7)>  
<2, (4, 8, 9)>  
<2, (5, 8, 9)>  
<2, (4, 5, 8)>  
<4, (2, 9, 5)>  
<6, (0, 8, 7)>  
<8, (2, 6, 9)>  
<9, (0, 2, 4)>

Count = 11

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [11].
