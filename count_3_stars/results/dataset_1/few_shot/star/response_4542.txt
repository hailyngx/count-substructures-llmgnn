Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 7

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 6, 5)>
<2, (4, 5, 7)>
<3, (0, 5, 7)>
