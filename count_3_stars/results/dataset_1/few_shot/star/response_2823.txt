Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 4, and node 8
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 7

Response:
Given the information provided, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph.

In a 3-star graph, the center node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's analyze which nodes meet this criteria:

- Nodes 0, 3, 8 can form a 3-star: <0, (3, 4, 5)>, <3, (0, 1, 2)>, <8, (0, 3, 5)>
- Nodes 1, 5, 7 can form a 3-star: <1, (3, 5, 7)>, <5, (0, 1, 2)>, <7, (1, 2, 3)>
- Nodes 2, 4, 9 can form a 3-star: <2, (3, 4, 5)>, <4, (0, 2, 5)>, <9, (2, 7)>

Therefore, there are 9 unique 3-stars in the given graph: <0, (3, 4, 5)>, <3, (0, 1, 2)>, <8, (0, 3, 5)>, <1, (3, 5, 7)>, <5, (0, 1, 2)>, <7, (1, 2, 3)>, <2, (3, 4, 5)>, <4, (0, 2, 5)>, <9, (2, 7)>.

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [9].
