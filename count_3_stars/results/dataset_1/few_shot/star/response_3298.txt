Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 10 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 7) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 1
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are:

<0, (4, 7, 2)>
<1, (8, 1, 0)>
<2, (7, 2, 4)>
<3, (6, 3, 7)>
<4, (0, 4, 7)>
<7, (2, 7, 4)>
<8, (1, 8, 0)>

Thus, the total number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [7].
