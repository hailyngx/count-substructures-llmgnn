Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 5

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all the unique configurations where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming the shape of a star.

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the given graph:

<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<0, (2, 6, 4)>
<1, (2, 5, 9)>
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<2, (0, 3, 1)>
<2, (1, 0, 3)>
<2, (1, 3, 0)>
<2, (3, 0, 1)>
<2, (3, 1, 0)>
<3, (2, 4, 9)>
<5, (1, 6, 9)>
<6, (0, 5, 8)>
<9, (2, 3, 5)>
