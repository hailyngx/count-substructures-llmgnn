Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 7
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 7

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are:

<0, (8, 6, 8)>
<2, (3, 4, 7)>
<2, (4, 3, 9)>
<2, (9, 7, 4)>
<4, (2, 3, 7)>
<4, (3, 2, 9)>
<4, (7, 9, 2)>
<7, (4, 9, 2)>
<8, (0, 6, 8)>
<9, (2, 7, 4)>
