Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 6

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star structures in the given graph:
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 2, and 7.
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 9, and 3.

Next, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph:

Total number of 3-stars: [2]

Unique 3-stars:
<3, (1, 2, 7)>
<6, (7, 9, 3)>
