Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 6

Response:
Given the graph information, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph.

The central node of a 3-star can be any node with exactly 3 neighbors, and the other three nodes are those three neighbors themselves.

Let's identify the nodes with exactly 3 neighbors:
- Node 0 has 1 neighbor
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 1 neighbor
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors
- Node 5 has 1 neighbor
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 7 has 1 neighbor
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 1 neighbor

Nodes 1, 2, 6, and 8 are potential central nodes for 3-stars.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:
1. For Node 1:
    - <1, (2, 3, 5)>
[<1, (2, 3, 5)>]

2. For Node 2:
    - <2, (1, 3, 5)>
    - <2, (3, 2, 7)>
[<2, (1, 3, 5)>, <2, (3, 2, 7)>]

3. For Node 6:
    - <6, (4, 8, 9)>
[<6, (4, 8, 9)>]

4. For Node 8:
    - <8, (0, 4, 6)>
[<8, (0, 4, 6)>]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
