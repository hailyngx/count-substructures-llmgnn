Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all possible 3-stars. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

From the adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (1, 4, 8)>
<0, (1, 4, 9)>
<1, (0, 3, 6)>
<1, (0, 6, 8)>
<2, (4, 5, 9)>
<4, (0, 2, 5)>
<4, (2, 5, 7)>
<5, (2, 3, 6)>
<8, (0, 1, 9)>
<9, (0, 6, 8)>

Now we count how many unique 3-stars we have found: [9]
