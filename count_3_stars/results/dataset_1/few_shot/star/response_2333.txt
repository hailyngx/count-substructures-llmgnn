Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's start by identifying all the 3-stars in the graph:

<1, (5, 7, 9)>
<5, (1, 3, 4)>
<8, (1, 3, 9)>
