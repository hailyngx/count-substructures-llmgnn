Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a star structure.

Let's list the 3-star structures present in the graph:

<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<0, (5, 6, 8)>
<2, (0, 4, 5)>
<2, (0, 5, 7)>
<5, (0, 2, 7)>
<5, (0, 7, 9)>
<7, (3, 4, 5)>
<7, (4, 5, 8)>
<8, (0, 6, 7)>
<4, (0, 3, 7)>
<4, (0, 7, 9)>
<9, (4, 5, 0)>
<9, (5, 0, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
