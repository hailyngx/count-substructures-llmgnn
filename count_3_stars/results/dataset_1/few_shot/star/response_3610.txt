Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (2, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 8) (4, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 4

Response:
Let's find the 3-star graphs in the given graph:

1. <0, (1, 2, 6)>
2. <0, (1, 2, 8)>
3. <0, (1, 2, 3)>
4. <3, (6, 8, 9)>
5. <3, (6, 8, 4)>
6. <3, (6, 8, 0)>
7. <4, (8, 9, 3)>
8. <4, (8, 9, 6)>
9. <4, (8, 9, 0)>
