Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (9, 0) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 4
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all possible 3-stars and count them. 

Let's analyze each node and its connections:

- Node 0 forms 1 3-star: <0, (2, 9)>
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star: <1, (3, 4)>
- Node 2 forms 3 3-stars: <2, (0, 3, 4)>, <2, (3, 5, 6)>, <2, (4, 5, 6)>
- Node 3 forms 3 3-stars: <3, (1, 2, 5)>, <3, (2, 5, 6)>, <3, (5, 6, 4)>
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star: <4, (1, 2, 6)>
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star: <5, (2, 3, 9)>
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star: <6, (2, 3, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [11].
