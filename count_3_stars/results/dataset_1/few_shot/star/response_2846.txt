Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 9) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all unique 3-stars. 

Let's analyze the graph:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 4, and 7: <0, (3, 4, 7)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 3 and 8: <1, (3, 8)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 4 and 8: <2, (4, 8)>
- Node 3 forms 3-stars with nodes 0, 1, and 4: <3, (0, 1, 4)> and <3, (0, 4, 5)>
- Node 4 forms 3-stars with nodes 0, 2, and 9: <4, (0, 2, 9)> and <4, (0, 3, 9)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 3 and 9: <5, (3, 9)>

As the 3-stars are unique, the count is simply the number of unique 3-stars we found, which is 7.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
