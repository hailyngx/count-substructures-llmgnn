Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0
