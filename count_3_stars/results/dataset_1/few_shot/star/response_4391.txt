Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 2

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a star pattern. 

From the adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<0, (3, 5, 9)>
<2, (3, 5, 9)>
<5, (0, 2, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
<0, (3, 4, 5)> <0, (3, 5, 9)> <2, (3, 5, 9)> <5, (0, 2, 8)>
