Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible 3-star configurations, where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Here are the steps to find and count the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Identify nodes that have exactly 3 neighbors connected to them:
   - Node 0 has 2 neighbors
   - Node 1 has 4 neighbors
   - Node 2 has 3 neighbors
   - Node 3 has 3 neighbors
   - Node 4 has 4 neighbors
   - Node 5 has 3 neighbors
   - Node 6 has 1 neighbor
   - Node 7 has 2 neighbors
   - Node 8 has 2 neighbors
   - Node 9 has 2 neighbors

2. Since nodes 2, 3, and 5 have exactly 3 neighbors each, they can potentially form the center of a 3-star. Let's check each of these nodes:

    For Node 2:
    - <2, (4, 5, 6)>
    
    For Node 3:
    - <3, (0, 1, 4)>
    
    For Node 5:
    - <5, (2, 7, 9)>

3. Count the total number of unique 3-stars: [3]
