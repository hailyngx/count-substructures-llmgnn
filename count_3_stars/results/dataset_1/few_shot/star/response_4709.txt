Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we will check each node as a potential center of a 3-star and count how many 3-stars we can form around it. 

Let's go through each node and identify the 3-stars:

For Node 0:
It is not connected to 3 other nodes, so no 3-star can be formed around Node 0.

For Node 1:
Possible 3-stars: <1, (5, 6, 9)>, <1, (6, 7, 9)>
Total: 2

For Node 2:
Possible 3-stars: <2, (3, 4, 9)>, <2, (4, 7, 9)>, <2, (7, 8, 9)>
Total: 3

For Node 3:
Possible 3-stars: <3, (2, 4, 9)>, <3, (4, 7, 9)>
Total: 2

For Node 4:
Possible 3-stars: <4, (2, 3, 9)>, <4, (3, 7, 9)>, <4, (7, 8, 9)>
Total: 3

For Node 5:
Possible 3-stars: <5, (1, 6, 9)>
Total: 1

For Node 6:
Possible 3-stars: <6, (1, 5, 9)>, <6, (8, 9, 1)>
Total: 2

For Node 7:
Possible 3-stars: <7, (1, 4, 9)>, <7, (2, 9, 4)>
Total: 2

For Node 8:
Possible 3-stars: <8, (2, 4, 6)>
Total: 1

For Node 9:
Possible 3-stars: <9, (1, 2, 3)>, <9, (1, 2, 4)>, <9, (1, 5, 6)>, <9, (1, 6, 7)>, <9, (2, 3, 4)>, <9, (2, 4, 7)>, <9, (3, 4, 7)>
Total: 7

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [20].
Unique 3-stars: <1, (5, 6, 9)>, <1, (6, 7, 9)>, <2, (3, 4, 9)>, <2, (4, 7, 9)>, <2, (7, 8, 9)>, <3, (2, 4, 9)>, <3, (4, 7, 9)>, <4, (2, 3, 9)>, <4, (3, 7, 9)>, <4, (7, 8, 9)>, <5, (1, 6, 9)>, <6, (1, 5, 9)>, <6, (8, 9, 1)>, <7, (1, 4, 9)>, <7, (2, 9, 4)>, <8, (2, 4, 6)>, <9, (1, 2, 3)>, <9, (1, 2, 4)>, <9, (1, 5, 6)>, <9, (1, 6, 7)>
