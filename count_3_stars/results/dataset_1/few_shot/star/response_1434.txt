Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 6

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph.

Based on the given edges and adjacency list, the 3-stars can be identified as follows:

<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<2, (3, 5, 9)>
<3, (0, 2, 5)>
<4, (0, 7, 8)>
<6, (7, 8, 9)>
<9, (1, 2, 3)>

Therefore, there are [6] 3-stars in the graph.
