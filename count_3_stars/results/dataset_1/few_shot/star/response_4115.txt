Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 6

Response:
The 3-stars in this graph are: 
<1, (2, 3, 5)>
<1, (3, 4, 5)>
<2, (1, 3, 8)>
<3, (1, 2, 4)>
<4, (3, 5, 9)>
<5, (1, 4, 9)>
<6, (4, 7, 9)>
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
