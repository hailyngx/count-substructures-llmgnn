Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find the unique 3-stars that exist in the graph.

Let's analyze the graph to find all 3-stars:

1. Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 4, and 7: <0, (2, 4, 7)>
2. Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 8, and 9: <2, (0, 8, 9)>
3. Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 6, and 7: <5, (4, 6, 7)>
4. Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 5, and 8: <7, (0, 5, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
