Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (2, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible 3-stars. 

There are a few ways to approach this problem, but one way is to look for nodes that have exactly 3 neighbors. These nodes can serve as potential central nodes for 3-stars. We can then check if each neighbor of these central nodes is connected to each other, forming a 3-star.

Let's start by listing the potential 3-stars:

<0, (5, 9)>
<3, (8, 9)>
<7, (2, 9)>
<8, (3, 4, 6)>
<9, (0, 3, 7)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph:
