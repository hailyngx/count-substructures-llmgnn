Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 5) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-star configurations in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern where the central node is connected to three leaves. 

After examining the adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-star configurations:

<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<1, (0, 4, 9)>
<2, (3, 6, 9)>
<3, (1, 2, 6)>
<4, (0, 1, 9)>
<5, (0, 6, 7)>
<6, (2, 3, 5)>
<8, (5, 9, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
