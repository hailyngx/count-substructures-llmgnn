Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's find the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 4, and 7 <0, (2, 4, 7)>
2. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 3, and 7 <1, (2, 3, 7)>
3. Node 7 forms two 3-stars:
    a. <7, (0, 1, 6)>
    b. <7, (1, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
