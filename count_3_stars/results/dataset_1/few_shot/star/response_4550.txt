Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node forms a 3-star with exactly three other nodes connected to it. 

Let's list the 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<1, (0, 5, 8)>
<3, (4, 6, 5)>
<4, (3, 6, 5)>
<5, (0, 4, 8)>
<8, (1, 5, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
