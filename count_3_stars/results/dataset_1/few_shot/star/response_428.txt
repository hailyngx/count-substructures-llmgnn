Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all possible 3-stars. Here is the list of unique 3-stars <center, (leaf1, leaf2, leaf3)> in the given graph:

<0, (2, 3, 5)>
<2, (0, 3, 9)>
<2, (3, 4, 6)>
<2, (4, 8, 9)>
<3, (0, 2, 9)>
<4, (2, 8, 9)>
<5, (0, 1, 8)>
<8, (4, 5, 6)>
<8, (4, 5, 9)>
<8, (5, 6, 9)>
<9, (2, 3, 4)>
<9, (4, 8, 9)>

Now let's calculate how many unique 3-stars are there in total. Once we count them, we will put the final answer inside brackets [].

Total number of unique 3-stars: 12

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
