Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (3, 4, 8)>
<1, (5, 7, 9)>
<6, (2, 7, 8)>
<7, (1, 5, 6)>
<8, (0, 5, 7)>

Counting the unique 3-star graphs, we have a total of [5] 3-star graphs in the given graph.
