Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 5, and node 8

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are <0, (4, 5, 9)>, <1, (6, 7, 9)>, <5, (0, 6, 9)>, and <8, (1, 6, 9)>. 
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
