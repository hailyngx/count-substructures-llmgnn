Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 8
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a 3-star pattern.

Based on the provided adjacency list and the definition of a 3-star graph, we can identify the following 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (1, 2, 9)>
<2, (0, 1, 4)>
<4, (2, 3, 9)>
<9, (0, 4, 5)>
<8, (3, 6, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
