Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes (hence forming a 3-star). 

Looking at the adjacency list and considering the definition of a 3-star graph, the only nodes that can form 3-stars are nodes 3, 6, 7, and 8. Let's identify the unique 3-stars:

<3, (0, 1, 6)>
<6, (3, 4, 5)>
<7, (2, 8, 9)>
<8, (6, 3, 7)>

Since these are all the possible 3-stars in the graph, the total number of 3-stars is [4].
