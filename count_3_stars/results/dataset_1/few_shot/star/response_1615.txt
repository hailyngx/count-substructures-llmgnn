Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-star subgraphs in the given graph, we need to identify all unique 3-stars. 

Here are the unique 3-stars in the graph:
1. <0, (2, 5, 7)>
2. <1, (2, 3, 5)>
3. <1, (2, 5, 6)>
4. <2, (0, 1, 5)>
5. <2, (0, 5, 7)>
6. <2, (1, 4, 5)>
7. <2, (5, 7, 8)>
8. <3, (1, 5, 8)>
9. <4, (2, 5, 6)>
10. <5, (0, 2, 7)>
11. <5, (1, 2, 3)>
12. <5, (2, 0, 7)>
13. <5, (2, 1, 4)>
14. <5, (2, 3, 8)>
15. <5, (2, 4, 6)>
16. <5, (2, 7, 8)>
17. <5, (3, 1, 8)>
18. <5, (4, 2, 6)>
19. <5, (7, 2, 8)>
20. <6, (1, 2, 5)>
21. <6, (4, 2, 5)>
22. <8, (2, 5, 9)>
23. <8, (3, 5, 9)>
24. <8, (5, 7, 9)>
25. <8, (5, 6, 9)>
26. <9, (5, 7, 8)>

Count of 3-star subgraphs: [26]
