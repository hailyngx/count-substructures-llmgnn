Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, and node 8

Response:
To find all the 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each central node which is connected to exactly three other nodes. Here are the steps to find and count the 3-stars:

1. Identify the central nodes by checking which nodes have exactly three neighbors.
   - Central nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7

2. For each central node, find the connected nodes to form a 3-star. Check all possible combinations.
   
   For central node 0:
   - <0, (5, 8, 9)>

   For central node 1:
   - <1, (8, 9)>

   For central node 2:
   - <2, (4, 6, 8)>
   
   For central node 3:
   No 3-star since it has only 2 connected nodes.

   For central node 4:
   - <4, (2, 5, 8)>
   
   For central node 6:
   - <6, (2, 5, 8)>
   - <6, (2, 7, 8)>

   For central node 7:
   - <7, (5, 6, 9)>

3. Count the total number of unique 3-stars found.
   - Total unique 3-stars: [6]

Therefore, the final answer is [6].
