Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 4, 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star. 

From the given graph:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 1, 7
- Node 1 doesn't form any 3-star since it is connected to more than 3 nodes
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 1, 7
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 0, 1, 4
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 3, 4, 6

Hence, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3]. 

Unique 3-stars: 
<0, (1, 7)>
<4, (1, 7)>
<7, (0, 1, 4)>
<9, (3, 4, 6)>
