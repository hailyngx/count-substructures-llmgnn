Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 5

Response:
