Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 5, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars by finding the central node and its three connected nodes. 

Looking at the graph, we see that there are multiple 3-stars present. Let's list them out:

1. <0, (1, 3, 4)>
2. <0, (1, 3, 8)>
3. <1, (0, 2, 3)>
4. <3, (0, 1, 7)>
5. <5, (2, 8, 9)>
6. <6, (2, 9, 0)>
7. <8, (0, 3, 5)>
8. <9, (5, 6, 0)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars found, we get a total of 8 3-stars in the given graph. 
Therefore, the final answer is [8].
