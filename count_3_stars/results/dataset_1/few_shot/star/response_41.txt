Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a star structure.

Now, let's find the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (4, 7, 0)>
<3, (2, 5, 6)>
<5, (1, 2, 3)>
<6, (3, 5, 9)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
