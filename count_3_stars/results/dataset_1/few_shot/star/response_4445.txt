Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 7) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 6

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
<0, (6, 8, 9)>
<2, (1, 5, 7)>
<6, (0, 2, 3)>
<7, (1, 2, 3)>
<8, (0, 5, -)>
<9, (0, 6, -)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph. 
So, the total number of 3-stars is [5].
