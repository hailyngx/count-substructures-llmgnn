Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2)

Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 2

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. These instances represent 3-stars.

To do this, we examine each node in the graph and check if it is connected to exactly three other nodes. If it is, we identify the 3-star pattern around that node.

Let's go through each node to find the 3-stars:
- Node 0: Not a 3-star.
- Node 1: 3-star found! <1, (0, 2, 6)>
- Node 2: 3-star found! <2, (0, 1, 5)>
- Node 3: Not a 3-star.
- Node 4: Not a 3-star.
- Node 5: Not a 3-star.
- Node 6: 3-star found! <6, (0, 1, 2)>
- Node 7: Not a 3-star.
- Node 8: Not a 3-star.
- Node 9: Not a 3-star.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3]. 
The unique 3-stars are: <<1, (0, 2, 6)>, <2, (0, 1, 5)>, <6, (0, 1, 2)>>.
