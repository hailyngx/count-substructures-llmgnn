Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 0) (8, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 3

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- From node 0: <0, (2, 5, 6)>, <0, (2, 7, 8)>
- From node 1: No 3-stars
- From node 2: <2, (0, 9, 3)>
- From node 3: <3, (1, 6, 9)>
- From node 4: No 3-stars
- From node 5: No 3-stars
- From node 6: No 3-stars
- From node 7: No 3-stars
- From node 8: No 3-stars
- From node 9: No 3-stars

Therefore, there are a total of [4] 3-stars in the given graph.
