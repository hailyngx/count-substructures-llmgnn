Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 4, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 6, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible instances where there is a central node connected to exactly three leaves. Let's find all the 3-stars in the graph:

<2, (5, 6, 8)>
<4, (1, 3, 7)>
<7, (3, 4, 6)>
<8, (0, 2, 4)>
<9, (1, 6, 7)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we find that there are [5] 3-stars in the graph.
