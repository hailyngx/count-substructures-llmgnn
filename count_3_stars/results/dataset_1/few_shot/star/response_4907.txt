Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 5) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 5

Response:
There are a total of [4] 3-stars in the given graph. 

<0, (4, 5, 9)>
<1, (5, 6, 9)>
<1, (5, 6, 2)>
<5, (1, 7, 9)>
