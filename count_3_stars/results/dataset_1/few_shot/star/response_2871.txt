Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 6

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 4, and 2. <2, (3, 4, 2)>
2. Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 7, and 8. <3, (2, 7, 8)>
3. Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 9, and 6. <6, (1, 9, 6)>
4. Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 3, and 8. <8, (0, 3, 8)>

Therefore, there are 4 3-stars in the given graph.
