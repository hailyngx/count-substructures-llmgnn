Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars by locating central nodes connected to exactly three other nodes (leaves).

In this graph, the 3-stars are as follows:
<3, (2, 4, 5)>
<4, (3, 5, 6)>
<5, (3, 4, 7)>
<8, (4, 6, 9)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph.
