Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 8

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are:
[<0, (5, 6, 1)>, <2, (4, 8, 9)>, <8, (2, 7, 9)>] 
The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
