Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will act as the center of the 3-star. We then confirm that the three nodes connected to the center are not directly connected to each other.

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Nodes connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 2: (2, 4, 8)
- Node 3: No 3-star as it is connected to only one node.
- Node 6: (6, 1, 9)
- Node 8: (8, 0, 7)
- Node 9: (9, 0, 6)

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].

<2, (4, 8, 0)>
<6, (1, 9, 0)>
<8, (0, 7, 2)>
