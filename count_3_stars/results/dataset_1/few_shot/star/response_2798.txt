Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 5

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

- Node 2 forms a 3-star with its neighbors: <2, (3, 7, 8)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with its neighbors: <3, (2, 4, 7)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with its neighbors: <4, (1, 3, 8)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with its neighbors: <5, (4, 9, -)>

Count of 3-stars: [4]
