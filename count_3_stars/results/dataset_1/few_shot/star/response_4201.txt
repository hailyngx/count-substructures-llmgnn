Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

In this graph, we find the following 3-stars:
<0, (1, 6, 3)>
<1, (0, 5, 3)>
<2, (3, 7, 8)>
<3, (2, 6, 7)>
<4, (9, 7, -)>
<5, (1, -, -)>
<6, (0, -, -)>
<7, (2, 3, 8)>
<8, (3, 7, -)>
<9, (4, 7, -)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
