Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 1) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-star graphs in this given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes forming a star structure. 

Let's find the 3-star structures in the graph:

1. Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 4, and 7: <0, (1, 4, 7)>
2. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 4, and 5: <1, (0, 4, 5)>
3. Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, and 2: <4, (0, 1, 2)>
4. Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 6, and 8: <9, (1, 6, 8)>

Count of 3-star graphs: [4]
