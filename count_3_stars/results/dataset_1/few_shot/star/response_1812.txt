Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern, which consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through the adjacency list for each node and identify the 3-stars:

1. Node 0: (0, 3, 6, 8), (0, 3, 6, 9). The center node is 0. 
   <0, (3, 6, 8)>
   <0, (3, 6, 9)>

2. Node 1: (1, 2, 7). The center node is 1.
   <1, (2, 7)>

3. Node 2: (2, 1, 5), (2, 1, 6). The center node is 2.
   <2, (1, 5, 6)>

4. Node 3: (3, 0, 7). The center node is 3.
   <3, (0, 7)>

5. Node 4: No 3-star.

6. Node 5: (5, 2, 6), (5, 6, 4). The center node is 5.
   <5, (2, 6, 4)>

7. Node 6: (6, 0, 2), (6, 0, 5), (6, 0, 7), (6, 0, 9), (6, 2, 5), (6, 2, 7), (6, 2, 9), (6, 5, 7), (6, 5, 9), (6, 7, 0)
   <6, (0, 2, 5)>
   <6, (0, 2, 7)>
   <6, (0, 2, 9)>
   <6, (0, 5, 7)>
   <6, (0, 5, 9)>
   <6, (0, 7, 9)>
   <6, (2, 5, 7)>
   <6, (2, 5, 9)>
   <6, (2, 7, 9)>
   <6, (5, 7, 9)>

8. Node 7: (7, 1, 3), (7, 1, 6). The center node is 7.
   <7, (1, 3, 6)>

9. Node 8: No 3-star.

10. Node 9: (9, 0, 6). The center node is 9.
   <9, (0, 6)>

Total Number of 3-Stars: [14]
Unique 3-Stars:
<0, (3, 6, 8)>
<0, (3, 6, 9)>
<1, (2, 7)>
<2, (1, 5, 6)>
<3, (0, 7)>
<5, (2, 6, 4)>
<6, (0, 2, 5)>
<6, (0, 2, 7)>
<6, (0, 2, 9)>
<6, (0, 5, 7)>
<6, (0, 5, 9)>
<6, (0, 7, 9)>
<6, (2, 5, 7)>
<6, (2, 5, 9)>
<6, (2, 7, 9)>
<6, (5, 7, 9)>
<7, (1, 3, 6)>
<9, (0, 6)>
