Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 4) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 7

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will look for nodes that have exactly 3 neighbors and count the number of unique 3-stars they form. 

From the adjacency list, we can see that nodes 6 and 9 have less than 3 neighbors, so they cannot form 3-stars.

After analyzing the graph: 
- Node 0 is a central node of a 3-star with nodes 1, 8, and 9 as leaves.
- Node 1 is a central node of a 3-star with nodes 3, 4, and 5 as leaves.
- Node 4 is a central node of a 3-star with nodes 1, 2, and 5 as leaves.
- Node 7 is a central node of a 3-star with nodes 4, 5, and 8 as leaves.

Hence, the unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (1, 8, 9)>, <1, (3, 4, 5)>, <4, (1, 2, 5)>, <7, (4, 5, 8)>
So the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
