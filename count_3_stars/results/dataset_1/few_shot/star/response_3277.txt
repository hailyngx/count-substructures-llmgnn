Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can identify each unique 3-star pattern by examining nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes using a star configuration.

Based on the provided adjacency list, the 3-stars in the graph are as follows:
<0, (1, 7, 9)>
<1, (0, 8, 9)>
<2, (4, 6, 7)>
<4, (2, 8, 5)>
<5, (7, 8, -)>
<7, (0, 2, 9)>
<8, (1, 4, 5)>
<9, (1, 7, -)>

Count: [7]
