Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node and its three connected nodes for each 3-star. 

Let's analyze each node in the graph to find the 3-stars:
- Node 0: There is no 3-star as this node is connected to more than 3 nodes.
- Node 1: There is no 3-star as this node is connected to only 2 nodes.
- Node 2: There is no 3-star as this node is connected to only 2 nodes.
- Node 3: <3, (4, 6, 8)>
- Node 4: <4, (0, 1, 3)>
- Node 5: There is no 3-star as this node is connected to more than 3 nodes.
- Node 6: <6, (0, 2, 3)>
- Node 7: There is no 3-star as this node is connected to more than 3 nodes.
- Node 8: There is no 3-star as this node is connected to more than 3 nodes.
- Node 9: There is no 3-star as this node is connected to more than 3 nodes.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3]. The unique 3-stars found are:

<3, (4, 6, 8)>
<4, (0, 1, 3)>
<6, (0, 2, 3)>
