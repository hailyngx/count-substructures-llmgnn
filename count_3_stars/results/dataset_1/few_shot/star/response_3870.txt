Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 7

Response:
Based on the given information, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, and 5: <0, (1, 3, 5)>
2. Node 0 forms another 3-star with nodes 1, 9, and 3: <0, (1, 9, 3)>
3. Node 0 forms yet another 3-star with nodes 1, 5, and 9: <0, (1, 5, 9)>
4. Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 8, and 9: <3, (0, 8, 9)>
5. Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 8, and 7: <4, (6, 8, 7)>
6. Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 9, and 6: <7, (2, 9, 6)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
