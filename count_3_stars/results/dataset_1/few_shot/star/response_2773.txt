Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central nodes and their corresponding leaves. 

From the adjacency list, we can see that the possible central nodes are nodes 0, 3, 6, and 9 since they each have exactly 3 neighbors. 

Now, let's analyze each potential central node to find the 3-stars:

1. For node 0: (0, 4, 6), (0, 6, 9) [2 unique 3-stars]

2. For node 3: (3, 6, 9) [1 unique 3-star]

3. For node 6: (6, 0, 4), (6, 2, 7), (6, 3, 9), (6, 4, 0), (6, 9, 8) [5 unique 3-stars]

4. For node 9: (9, 0, 6), (9, 3, 6), (9, 6, 8) [3 unique 3-stars]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2+1+5+3 = 11]. 

Hence, the final answer is [11].

List of unique 3-stars: 
<0, (4, 6, 9)>, <3, (6, 9)>, <6, (0, 4, 9)>, <6, (2, 7)>, <6, (3, 9)>, <6, (4, 0)>, <6, (9, 8)>, <9, (0, 6, 8)>, <9, (3, 6)>, <9, (6, 8)>
