Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's find the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 1: (4, 6, 8) is a 3-star.
- Node 1: (4, 6, 9) is a 3-star.
- Node 2: (4, 6, 7) is a 3-star.
- Node 4: (1, 2, 6) is a 3-star.
- Node 6: (1, 2, 4) is a 3-star.
- Node 6: (1, 4, 5) is a 3-star.
- Node 7: (2, 1, 9) is a 3-star.
- Node 8: (1, 3, 4) is a 3-star.
- Node 9: (1, 7, 4) is a 3-star.

So, there are a total of <1, (4, 6, 8)>, <1, (4, 6, 9)>, <2, (4, 6, 7)>, <4, (1, 2, 6)>, <6, (1, 2, 4)>, <6, (1, 4, 5)>, <7, (2, 1, 9)>, <8, (1, 3, 4)>, <9, (1, 7, 4)> 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
