Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in the form of a star.

Let's analyze the graph step by step:

1. Check each node in the graph to see if it forms a 3-star:
    - Node 0: (0, 2, 4, 5, 6) forms a 3-star <0, (2, 4, 5)>
    - Node 1: (1, 4, 5, 6) forms a 3-star <1, (4, 5, 6)>
    - Node 2: (2, 0, 3, 7) forms a 3-star <2, (0, 3, 7)>
    - Node 3: (3, 2, 5) doesn't form a 3-star.
    - Node 4: (4, 0, 1, 5, 7, 8, 9) forms two 3-stars <4, (0, 1, 5)> and <4, (7, 8, 9)>
    - Node 5: (5, 0, 1, 3, 4, 6) forms a 3-star <5, (0, 1, 3)>
    - Node 6: (6, 0, 1, 5, 7) forms a 3-star <6, (0, 1, 7)>
    - Node 7: (7, 2, 4, 6) doesn't form a 3-star.
    - Node 8: (8, 4, 9) doesn't form a 3-star.
    - Node 9: (9, 4, 8) doesn't form a 3-star.

After analyzing all nodes, the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<1, (4, 5, 6)>
<2, (0, 3, 7)>
<4, (0, 1, 5)>
<4, (7, 8, 9)>
<5, (0, 1, 3)>
<6, (0, 1, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
