Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify all possible configurations where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step by step:

1. Node 0:
   - Node 0 has edges to nodes 2, 4, 6, and 8.
   - Possible 3-stars centered at node 0: 
     <0, (2, 4, 6)>
     <0, (2, 4, 8)>

2. Node 2:
   - Node 2 has edges to nodes 0, 3, and 4.
   - Possible 3-stars centered at node 2: 
     <2, (0, 3, 4)>

3. Node 3:
   - Node 3 has edges to nodes 2, 4, and 9.
   - Possible 3-stars centered at node 3: 
     <3, (2, 4, 9)>

4. Node 4:
   - Node 4 has edges to nodes 0, 2, and 3.
   - Possible 3-stars centered at node 4: 
     <4, (0, 2, 3)>

5. Node 5:
   - Node 5 has edges to nodes 7, 8, and 9.
   - Possible 3-stars centered at node 5: 
     <5, (7, 8, 9)>

6. Node 9:
   - Node 9 has edges to nodes 1, 3, and 5.
   - Possible 3-stars centered at node 9: 
     <9, (1, 3, 5)>

Count of 3-stars: [6]
Unique 3-stars: <0, (2, 4, 6)>, <0, (2, 4, 8)>, <2, (0, 3, 4)>, <3, (2, 4, 9)>, <4, (0, 2, 3)>, <5, (7, 8, 9)>
