Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify them based on the definition provided.

1. A 3-star has a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.
2. We'll go through each node in the graph and check if it forms a 3-star.

Starting with node 0:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 6, 8, and 9. None of these connections form a 3-star. Skip node 0.

Moving to node 1:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 4. This forms a 3-star: <1, (0, 3, 4)>. 

Next, check node 2:
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0 and 7. None of these connections form a 3-star. Skip node 2.

Proceeding to node 3:
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 6, and 8. This forms a 3-star: <3, (1, 6, 8)>.

Moving on to node 4:
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1 and 5. None of these connections form a 3-star. Skip node 4.

Checking node 5:
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1 and 4. None of these connections form a 3-star. Skip node 5.

Checking node 6:
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 8, and 9. This forms two 3-stars: <6, (0, 3, 8)> and <6, (0, 8, 9)>.

Proceeding to node 7:
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2 and 8. None of these connections form a 3-star. Skip node 7.

Moving to node 8:
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 5, 6, and 7. None of these connections form a 3-star. Skip node 8.

Checking node 9:
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0 and 6. None of these connections form a 3-star. Skip node 9.

The unique 3-stars identified are:
- <1, (0, 3, 4)>
- <3, (1, 6, 8)>
- <6, (0, 3, 8)>
- <6, (0, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
