Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 6

Response:
The graph can be visualized as follows:

```
    1 --- 9
   /       |
  0 --- 2  8
   \   /| /
    6  3 7
       | |
       4 5
```

To count the number of 3-stars, we can look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list the 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (2, 6, 8)>
<1, (9, 3, 0)>
<2, (0, 6, 8)>
<3, (4, 5, 6)>
<4, (7, 5, 6)>
<5, (7, 4, 9)>
<6, (0, 3, 4)>
<7, (4, 5, 9)>
<8, (2, 3, 6)>
<9, (1, 5, 6)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
