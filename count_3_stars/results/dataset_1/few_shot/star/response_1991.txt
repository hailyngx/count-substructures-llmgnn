Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 8

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star pattern. 

Let's go step by step:
1. For each node, check its neighbors to find 3-stars that can be formed with that node as the center.
2. Write down the unique 3-stars in the format <center, (leaf1, leaf2, leaf3)>.

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<1, (0, 3, 5)>
<2, (3, 4, 6)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<4, (2, 8, 9)>
<5, (0, 1, 6)>
<6, (2, 3, 5)>
<8, (1, 2, 4)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
