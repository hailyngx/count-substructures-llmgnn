Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first identify the nodes that are part of 3-stars. Since a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we look for nodes that have a degree of 3 in the graph. 

From the adjacency list provided, the nodes with a degree of 3 are: 1, 4, 5, and 9.

Next, we need to check if there are actual 3-stars involving these nodes. A 3-star is uniquely defined by the center node and the three leaves connected to it. Let's find all the unique 3-stars:

1. <1, (4, 5, 7)>
2. <4, (1, 5, 9)>
3. <5, (1, 4, 6)>
4. <9, (4, 5, 8)>

So, there are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
The final answer is [4].
