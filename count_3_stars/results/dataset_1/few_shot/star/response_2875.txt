Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 8

Response:
Given the information provided, let's identify the 3-star subgraphs in the graph.

The 3-star subgraphs are as follows:
<1, (3, 4, 6)>
<1, (3, 6, 9)>
<3, (1, 2, 5)>
<3, (1, 5, 7)>
<3, (8, 5, 7)>
<6, (1, 5, 7)>
<8, (3, 1, 9)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
