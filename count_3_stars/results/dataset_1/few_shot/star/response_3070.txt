Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 4

Response:
First, let's find the 3-stars by looking for nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them. These nodes would be the potential centers of 3-stars. Then we can check the neighbors of these potential centers to see if they form a 3-star pattern.

The nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them are nodes 6 and 7. Let's check their neighbors:

Node 6: (0, 2, 7)
Node 7: (4, 6)

We find two 3-stars:
<6, (0, 2, 7)>
<7, (4, 6)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2]. 
<1, (2, 4, 5)>
