Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 5, and node 7

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

The nodes that have exactly 3 edges, forming a 3-star, are: node 0, node 1, node 2, node 5, and node 8.

There are a total of [5] unique 3-stars in the given graph.

Inside brackets: [5]
Unique 3-stars: <0, (2, 3, 5)>, <1, (3, 7, 9)>, <2, (0, 8, 3)>, <5, (0, 7, 9)>, <8, (0, 2, 3)>
