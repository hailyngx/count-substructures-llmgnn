Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 8

Response:
First, we identify the 3-star patterns in the graph. 

From the adjacency list, we see that the nodes with exactly three neighbors are: 1, 4, and 6.

Next, for each of these nodes, we find the neighbors and check if they form a 3-star pattern. 

For node 1:
- Node 1 is connected to node 5.
- Nodes 1 and 5 together with any other node cannot form a 3-star since node 1 only has one neighbor.

For node 4:
- Node 4 is connected to node 3.
- Nodes 3, 4, and any other node cannot form a 3-star since node 4 only has one neighbor.

For node 6:
- Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes, so it cannot be part of a 3-star pattern.

Therefore, there are no 3-stars in this graph. So, the final answer is [0].
