Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 2) (8, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern.

Looking at the adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<2, (1, 3, 8)>
<3, (2, 4, 6)>
<4, (1, 3, 5)>
<6, (1, 3, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6]. 
<number of 3-stars: [6]>
