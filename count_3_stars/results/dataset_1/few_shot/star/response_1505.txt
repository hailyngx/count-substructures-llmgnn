Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star pattern. 

In this case, we will look for nodes that have exactly three neighbors and form a 3-star pattern around them.

Nodes with exactly three neighbors:
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 6.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 4, 9, and 9 (repeated).

Therefore, there are two 3-stars in the given graph:
[2]

Unique 3-stars found:
<3, (2, 5, 6)>
<8, (4, 9, 9)>
