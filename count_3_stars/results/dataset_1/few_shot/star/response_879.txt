Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 6

Response:
First, identify the nodes that are at the center of a 3-star. These are the nodes that have exactly three neighbors.

In this graph, the nodes at the center of 3-stars are: 
- Node 0 (neighbors: 3, 5, 8)
- Node 2 (neighbors: 3, 4, 5)
- Node 3 (neighbors: 0, 1, 2)
- Node 5 (neighbors: 0, 2, 4)
- Node 8 (neighbors: 0, 2, 7)

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars: observe each of the 3-star configurations and count them.
