Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can first identify the central node (the center) of each 3-star. Since each 3-star has 3 leaves connected to the center, we can look for nodes that have exactly 3 neighbors. 

In this graph:
- Node 6 is connected to 3 neighbors (nodes 0, 2, and 7). So it is the center of one 3-star.
- Node 7 is also connected to 3 neighbors (nodes 4, 6, and 9). So it is the center of another 3-star.
- Node 8 and node 3 each have only 2 neighbors, so they are not centers of 3-stars.

Now let's determine the leaves of each 3-star:

1. 3-star with center at node 6:
   - Center: 6
   - Leaves: 0, 2, 7
<6, (0, 2, 7)>

2. 3-star with center at node 7:
   - Center: 7
   - Leaves: 4, 6, 9
<7, (4, 6, 9)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars in the graph:
