Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 9
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for nodes that have exactly three neighbors, forming a 3-star pattern around them.

The nodes that have exactly three neighbors are: node 1, node 4, and node 6.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars in the graph:
<1, (0, 4, 9)>
<4, (1, 3, 7)>
<6, (3, 9, None)>

Count of 3-stars: [3]
