Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern where one node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Looking at the graph, we can see that the nodes 0, 4, 6, 7, and 9 satisfy the definition of being the center of a 3-star since they are each connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list the unique 3-stars:
<0, (2, 4, 9)>
<4, (0, 5, 6)>
<6, (4, 8, 9)>
<7, (3, 8, 9)>
<9, (0, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
