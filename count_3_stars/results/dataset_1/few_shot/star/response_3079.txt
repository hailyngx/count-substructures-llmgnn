Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 3

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all the possible combinations where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list all the possible 3-star configurations:

<0, (1, 3, 6)>
<1, (0, 2, 6)>
<1, (0, 6, 8)>
<1, (0, 6, 9)>
<2, (1, 3, 5)>
<3, (0, 2, 5)>
<3, (0, 4, 5)>
<3, (2, 4, 5)>
<4, (3, 6, 8)>
<5, (2, 3, 7)>
<8, (1, 4, 7)>

Counting the unique 3-star configurations, we get a total of [11] 3-stars in the graph.
