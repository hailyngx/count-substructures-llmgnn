Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 6

Response:
The given graph contains the following 3-stars:

<0, (1, 3, 9)>
<1, (0, 3, 6)>
<2, (5, 6, 9)>
<3, (0, 1, 6)>
<6, (1, 2, 3)>
<5, (2, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
