Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 6, and node 7

Response:
Given the graph, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph. 

We look for nodes that are connected to exactly 3 other nodes. Let's list them:

<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<0, (2, 3, 6)>
<0, (2, 4, 9)>
<0, (2, 6, 9)>
<0, (3, 4, 6)>
<0, (3, 4, 9)>
<0, (3, 6, 9)>
<0, (4, 6, 9)>
<3, (0, 1, 5)>
<3, (1, 5, 8)>
<6, (0, 8, 9)>
