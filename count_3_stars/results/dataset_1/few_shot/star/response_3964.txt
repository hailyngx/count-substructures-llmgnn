Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 8

Response:
There are 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

The 3-stars are: 
<0, (3, 4, 7)>
<4, (0, 2, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
