Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 3

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the provided adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars:

<0, (2, 6, 8)>
<1, (5, 9)>
<2, (0, 3, 7)>
<3, (2, 4, 9)>
<4, (3, 6, 7)>
<5, (1)>
<6, (0, 4, 8)>
<7, (2, 3, 4)>
<8, (0, 6)>
<9, (1, 2, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
