Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the unique 3-stars. 

From the provided adjacency list, we can observe the following 3-stars:
1. Node 0: <0, (1, 4, 6)>
2. Node 4: <4, (0, 2, 3)>
3. Node 6: <6, (0, 2, 4)>
4. Node 8: <8, (1, 2, 4)>
