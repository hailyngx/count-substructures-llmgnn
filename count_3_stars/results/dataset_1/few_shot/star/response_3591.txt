Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 7

Response:
Let's first identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<0, (7, 8, 9)>
<2, (0, 4, 9)>
<3, (2, 4, 5)>
<4, (0, 2, 6)>
<5, (0, 3, 4)>
<6, (3, 4, 8)>
<7, (0, 9, 1)>
<8, (0, 6, -)>
<9, (0, 2, 7)>

There are a total of [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
