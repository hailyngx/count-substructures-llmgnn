Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a 3-star structure with that node as the center.

Based on the given graph and adjacency list, we find the following 3-star structures:

<0, (7, 1, 8)>
<1, (3, 7, 0)>
<1, (7, 3, 2)>
<2, (3, 8, 1)>
<2, (8, 3, 1)>
<3, (1, 2, 7)>
<3, (2, 8, 1)>
<7, (0, 1, 8)>
<7, (1, 3, 8)>
<7, (8, 2, 1)>
<8, (2, 7, 1)>
<8, (7, 1, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
