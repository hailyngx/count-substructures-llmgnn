Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we can identify each unique 3-star pattern where a node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes. 

Given the adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (2, 5, 6)>
<1, (2, 6, 0)>
<2, (0, 1, 4)>
<4, (2, 3, 9)>
<6, (0, 1, 5)>
<9, (4, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
