Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 5, and node 7

Response:
The given graph contains the following 3-stars: 

<0, (2, 6, 9)>
<2, (0, 7, 9)>
<5, (4, 8, 9)>
<6, (0, 4, 7)>
<7, (1, 2, 9)>
<9, (0, 2, 3)>
<9, (5, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
