Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 5, and node 7

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 5, and 8: <0, (1, 5, 8)>
2. Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 5, and 9: <0, (1, 5, 9)>
3. Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 8, and 9: <0, (1, 8, 9)>
4. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 4, and 6: <1, (0, 4, 6)>
5. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 6, and 9: <1, (0, 6, 9)>
6. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 6, and 9: <1, (4, 6, 9)>
7. Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, and 5: <9, (0, 1, 5)>
8. Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, and 7: <9, (0, 1, 7)>
9. Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 2, and 5: <9, (1, 2, 5)>

Therefore, there are a total of [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
