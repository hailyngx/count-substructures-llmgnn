Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 4, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Since a 3-star consists of a central node and three leaves, we can look for nodes with exactly three neighbors. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we can identify the following nodes that have exactly three neighbors:
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 2.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 6, and 9.

Now, we can list the unique 3-stars found:
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<7, (1, 4, 9)>
<8, (2, 6, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
