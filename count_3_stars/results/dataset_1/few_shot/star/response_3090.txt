Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 4

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be counted by examining each node and checking if it is the center of a 3-star. A 3-star will have the center connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a star shape.

Let's find the 3-stars present in the given graph:

- Node 2 forms a 3-star: <2, (1, 7, 8)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star: <3, (1, 7, -)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star: <7, (2, 3, 4)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star: <8, (0, 2, 5)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star: <9, (2, 4, -)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
