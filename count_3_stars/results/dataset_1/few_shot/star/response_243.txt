Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 4

Response:
First, we need to identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 
Since a 3-star consists of a center node connected to three other nodes, we will look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 
Let's list the 3-stars found in the given graph:

<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<0, (2, 6, 7)>
<0, (2, 7, 9)>
<2, (0, 3, 5)>
<2, (0, 5, 7)>
<2, (3, 6, 7)>
<3, (2, 6, 7)>
<3, (6, 7, 9)>
<6, (0, 3, 8)>
<7, (0, 1, 3)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the given graph:
[10]
