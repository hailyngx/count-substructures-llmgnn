Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 8

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star configuration. Let's go step by step:

1. Identify nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
   - Node 0 is connected to 3 nodes (1, 2, 5)
   - Node 1 is connected to 3 nodes (0, 4, 9)
   - Node 2 is connected to 4 nodes (0, 4, 8, 9)
   - Node 5 is connected to 2 nodes (0, 9)
   - Node 8 is connected to 3 nodes (2, 6, 9)

2. For each of these nodes, check if the connections form a 3-star:
   - Node 0 forms a 3-star: <0, (1, 2, 5)>
   - Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (0, 4, 9)>
   - Node 2 does not form a 3-star as it has 4 connections
   - Node 5 does not form a 3-star as it has only 2 connections
   - Node 8 forms a 3-star: <8, (2, 6, 9)>

3. Count the total number of 3-stars: [2]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2]. 
The unique 3-stars found are <0, (1, 2, 5)> and <8, (2, 6, 9)>.
