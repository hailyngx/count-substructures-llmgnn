Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star-like pattern. 

From the provided information, we can see that the possible 3-stars are as follows:
<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<4, (1, 7, 9)>
<5, (0, 6, 7)>
<6, (0, 3, 5)>
<7, (4, 5, 9)>

Count of 3-stars: [5]
