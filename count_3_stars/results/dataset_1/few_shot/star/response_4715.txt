Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 3

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first understand what a 3-star is in this context. 

A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Let's list all the 3-stars present in the graph:

<0, (2, 4, 7)>
<3, (0, 6, 8)>

There are 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph, so the final answer is [2].
