Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph along with their central node and leaf nodes:
<0, (1, 2, 8)>
<1, (0, 4, 5)>
<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<2, (0, 3, 7)>
<2, (4, 5, 8)>
<3, (0, 2, 4)>
<4, (1, 3, 6)>
<4, (2, 8, 9)>
<5, (1, 6, 8)>
<6, (1, 4, 9)>
<6, (5, 4, 9)>
<8, (0, 2, 5)>
<8, (2, 4, 5)>
<9, (4, 6)>

Count of 3-stars: [15]
