Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 7

Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all possible 3-stars. Since each 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we will need to check all possible combinations of nodes connected to a central node.

Let's go step by step:

1. Identify the nodes that are connected by exactly three edges. These are potential central nodes for the 3-stars.

Potential central nodes: 2, 3, 5, 7

2. For each potential central node, determine the nodes connected to it. Verify if these connections form valid 3-stars.

Lets check for each potential central node:
For central node 2: (2, 1, 3), (2, 3, 0), (2, 0, 1) are not valid 3-stars as they don't satisfy the 3-star structure.
For central node 3: (3, 2, 5) is a valid 3-star.
For central node 5: (5, 0, 3), (5, 3, 4), (5, 4, 6) are not valid 3-stars.
For central node 7: (7, 1, 4), (7, 4, 9), (7, 9, 3) are not valid 3-stars.

3. Calculate the total number of valid 3-stars found.

Valid 3-star found: <3, (2, 5, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1].
