Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is at the center of a 3-star configuration. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we can determine the following 3-star configurations:
<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<0, (2, 4, 7)>
<0, (2, 4, 8)>
<0, (3, 4, 7)>
<0, (3, 4, 8)>
<0, (4, 6, 8)>
<0, (4, 7, 8)>
<0, (4, 7, 6)>
<6, (4, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
