Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 8

Response:
First, let's find the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, as required for a 3-star graph. Based on the adjacency list provided, nodes 1, 2, and 3 meet this condition. We will focus on these nodes as potential centers of 3-star graphs.

Now, let's identify the possible 3-star structures with nodes 1, 2, and 3 as the center. For each center node, we will check its neighbors to form a 3-star graph. 

For Node 1:
- <1, (3, 5, 6)>
- <1, (3, 5, 9)>
- <1, (5, 6, 9)>

For Node 2:
- <2, (6, 7, 8)>

For Node 3:
- <3, (1, 8, 9)>
- <3, (5, 8, 9)>

Let's count the total number of 3-star graphs in this given graph. []
