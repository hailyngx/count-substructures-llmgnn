Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star pattern. 

Let's analyze each node to see if it serves as the center of a 3-star: 

- Node 0: <0, (5, 8, 9)> [1]
- Node 1: Not a center of any 3-star since it has less than 3 outgoing edges. 
- Node 2: <2, (1, 4, 5)> [1]
- Node 3: Not a center of any 3-star since it has no outgoing edges. 
- Node 4: Not a center of any 3-star since it has less than 3 outgoing edges. 
- Node 5: <5, (0, 2, 7)> [1]
- Node 6: Not a center of any 3-star since it has less than 3 outgoing edges. 
- Node 7: Not a center of any 3-star since it has less than 3 outgoing edges. 
- Node 8: <8, (0, 6, 9)> [1]
- Node 9: <9, (0, 2, 8)> [1]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (5, 8, 9)>, <2, (1, 4, 5)>, <5, (0, 2, 7)>, <8, (0, 6, 9)>, <9, (0, 2, 8)>
