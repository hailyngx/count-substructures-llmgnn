Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star-like pattern. Given the adjacency list, the 3-stars can be found by examining each node and its connections. 

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<1, (2, 7, 8)>
<2, (1, 3, 4)>
<4, (0, 2, 7)>
<7, (1, 4, 6)>

Therefore, there are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.
