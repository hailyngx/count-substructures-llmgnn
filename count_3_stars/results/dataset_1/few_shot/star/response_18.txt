Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. We will list the unique 3-stars found. 

Observing the given edges and adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (2, 3, 6)>
<1, (3, 4, 8)>
<2, (0, 5, 9)>
<3, (0, 1, 5)>
<4, (1, 6, 9)>
<5, (0, 2, 7)>
<6, (0, 4, 9)>
<7, (4, 5)>
<8, (1)>
<9, (4, 5, 6)>

Count of 3-stars: [9]
