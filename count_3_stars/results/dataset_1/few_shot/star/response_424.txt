Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 7

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0: (5, 8, 9) - <0, (5, 8, 9)>
2. Node 1: (3, 4, 7) - <1, (3, 4, 7)>
3. Node 4: (1, 2, 7) - <4, (1, 2, 7)>
4. Node 7: (1, 4, 9) - <7, (1, 4, 9)>
  
Therefore, there are a total of [4] 3-stars in the given graph.
