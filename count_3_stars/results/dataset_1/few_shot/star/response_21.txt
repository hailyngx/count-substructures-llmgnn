Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 8

Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 4, 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique set of nodes that form a 3-star.

Let's go through the adjacency list for each node to find the 3-stars:
1. Check each node's connections to see if it is a 3-star.
2. If a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, form a 3-star centered at that node.

Let's start:
- Node 0 is not part of any 3-star.
- Node 1 is not part of any 3-star.
- Node 2 forms a 3-star: <2, (3, 7, 8)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star: <3, (2, 4, 5)>
- Node 4 is not part of any 3-star.
- Node 5 is not part of any 3-star.
- Node 6 is not part of any 3-star.
- Node 7 forms two 3-stars: <7, (0, 2, 9)> and <7, (6, 9, 0)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star: <8, (0, 1, 2)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star: <9, (3, 4, 6)>, <9, (7, 3, 4)>

Count of 3-stars: [6]
Unique 3-stars:
<2, (3, 7, 8)>
<3, (2, 4, 5)>
<7, (0, 2, 9)>
<7, (6, 9, 0)>
<8, (0, 1, 2)>
<9, (3, 4, 6)>
