Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 5
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 7, and node 8

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes forming a 3-star pattern. Let's list down the unique 3-stars present in the graph:

<0, (2, 3, 5)>
<2, (0, 3, 5)>
<3, (0, 2, 7)>
<4, (2, 8, -)>
<5, (0, 2, 6)>
<6, (2, 5, -)>
<7, (2, 3, 9)>
<8, (3, 4, 5)>
<9, (7, 8, -)>

Count of 3-stars in the graph: [9]
