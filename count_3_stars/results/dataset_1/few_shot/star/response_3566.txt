Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (1, 7, 9)>
<1, (0, 6, 8)>
<2, (5, 8, _)> (No 3rd leaf connected)
<3, (4, 5, 9)>
<4, (3, _, _)> (Not a 3-star as it has only 1 leaf connected)
<5, (2, 3, 6)>
<6, (1, 5, _)> (No 3rd leaf connected)
<7, (0, 9, _)>
<8, (1, 2, _)> (No 3rd leaf connected)
<9, (1, 3, 7)>

Count of 3-stars: [7]
The unique 3-stars are: <0, (1, 7, 9)>, <1, (0, 6, 8)>, <3, (4, 5, 9)>, <5, (2, 3, 6)>, <7, (0, 9, _)>, <8, (1, 2, _)>, <9, (1, 3, 7)>
