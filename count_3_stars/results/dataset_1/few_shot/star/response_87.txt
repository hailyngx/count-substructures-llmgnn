Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 1
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible 3-stars based on the given information.

Starting with the definition of a 3-star graph, we look for nodes with exactly 3 edges.

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (1, 7, 9)>
<1, (0, 3, 8)>
<2, (5, 6, 9)>
<6, (2, 5, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 6)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph: 
[5]
