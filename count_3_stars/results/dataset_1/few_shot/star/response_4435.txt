Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the 3-stars. A 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Counting the 3-stars:
1. From the given graph and adjacency list, let's identify the 3-stars:
   - Node 0: No 3-stars as it does not have 3 connected nodes.
   - Node 1: <1, (0, 4, 6)>
   - Node 2: No 3-stars as it does not have 3 connected nodes.
   - Node 3: No 3-stars as it does not have 3 connected nodes.
   - Node 4: <4, (1, 3, 8)>
   - Node 5: <5, (0, 6, 6)>
   - Node 6: <6, (1, 5, 9)>
   - Node 7: No 3-stars as it does not have 3 connected nodes.
   - Node 8: No 3-stars as it does not have 3 connected nodes.
   - Node 9: No 3-stars as it does not have 3 connected nodes.

2. The identified 3-stars are: 
   <1, (0, 4, 6)>, <4, (1, 3, 8)>, <5, (0, 6, 6)>, <6, (1, 5, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
