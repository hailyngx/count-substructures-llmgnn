Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 7
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 8

Response:
The total number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [1].
