Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern.

Let's identify the 3-stars:
1. <0, (1, 2, 3)>
2. <0, (1, 5, 6)>
3. <0, (1, 7, 9)>
4. <1, (0, 6, 9)>
5. <2, (0, 3, 6)>
6. <3, (0, 2, 9)>
7. <6, (1, 2, 4)>
8. <6, (1, 4, 9)>
9. <6, (4, 8, 9)>
10. <6, (5, 0, 9)>
11. <6, (9, 7, 1)>
12. <6, (9, 8, 4)>
13. <6, (9, 8, 1)>

There are a total of [13] 3-stars in the given graph.
