Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. These instances represent 3-stars in the graph.

Looking at the adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<1, (4, 6, 7)>
<2, (3, 6, 7)>
<6, (1, 2, 8)>
<6, (1, 2, 9)>
<7, (0, 1, 2)>
<9, (4, 6, 9)>

Count of 3-stars: [6]
