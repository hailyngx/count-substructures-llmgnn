Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can identify the nodes that form 3-stars and then count them. 

The unique 3-stars in this graph are as follows: 
<0, (1, 8, 9)>
<1, (0, 4, 5)>
<1, (3, 4, 9)>
<1, (5, 2, 8)>
<4, (1, 2, 9)>
<5, (1, 2, 8)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
