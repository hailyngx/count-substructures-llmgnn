Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will first need to identify all the unique 3-stars in the graph. A 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Based on the given information and the definition of a 3-star:
- Node 1 is the center of a 3-star connected to nodes 2, 5, 6. This forms one 3-star. <1, (2, 5, 6)>
- Node 5 is the center of a 3-star connected to nodes 1, 6, 7. This forms another 3-star. <5, (1, 6, 7)>
- Node 6 is the center of a 3-star connected to nodes 1, 3, 9. This forms another 3-star. <6, (1, 3, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: <1, (2, 5, 6)>, <5, (1, 6, 7)>, <6, (1, 3, 9)>.
