Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:
- Identify nodes that are connected in a star pattern, where one node is connected to exactly three other nodes.
- Count the occurrences of such patterns.

Based on the provided information, the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 6, 7)>
<1, (4, 5, 8)>
<3, (5, 6, -)>
<4, (1, 5, 7)>
<5, (1, 3, 9)>
<6, (0, 3, 8)>
<7, (2, 4, 6)>
<8, (1, 6, -)>
<9, (2, 5, -)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
