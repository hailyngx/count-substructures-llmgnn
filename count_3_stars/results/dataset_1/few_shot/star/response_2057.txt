Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph with 10 nodes and 24 edges, we first need to find the 3-stars in the graph. 

Here is the list of unique 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (2, 3, 5)>
<2, (0, 6, 8)>
<3, (0, 5, 8)>
<4, (6, 8, 9)>
<8, (2, 3, 4)>
<9, (3, 4)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph by counting the occurrences of these unique 3-stars:
