Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, and node 4
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is directly connected to three other nodes. These instances represent 3-stars in the graph.

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (5, 6, 4)>
<1, (4, 6, 2)>
<2, (4, 6, 1)>
<4, (1, 2, 6)>
<5, (0, 8, 4)>
<6, (0, 1, 2)>
<8, (4, 5, 9)>
