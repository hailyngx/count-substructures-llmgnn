Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 0) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern. 

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph. 
Here are the 3-stars in the graph: 

<0, (2, 4, 7)>
<0, (2, 4, 9)>
<0, (4, 7, 1)>
<0, (4, 9, 5)>
<0, (7, 9, 8)>
<0, (9, 5, 6)>
<0, (9, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
