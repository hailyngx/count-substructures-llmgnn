Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 6

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 2 forms a 3-star with leaves 1, 4, and 6: <2, (1, 4, 6)>
2. Node 3 forms a 3-star with leaves 2, 6, and 9: <3, (2, 6, 9)>
3. Node 6 forms a 3-star with leaves 0, 7, and 8: <6, (0, 7, 8)>
4. Node 6 forms a 3-star with leaves 2, 3, and 9: <6, (2, 3, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
