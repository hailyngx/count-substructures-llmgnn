Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 5) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 2

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- Starting with Node 0: <0, (3, 5, 6)>, <0, (3, 6, 9)>, <0, (5, 6, 9)>
- Node 3: <3, (0, 4, 8)>
- Node 5: <5, (0, 7, -)>
- Node 6: <6, (0, 1, 2)>, <6, (1, 2, -)>
- Node 9: <9, (0, 2, -)>

Count of 3-stars: [6]
