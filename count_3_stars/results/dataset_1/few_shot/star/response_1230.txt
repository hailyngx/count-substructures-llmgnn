Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 6) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 4, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, and node 7

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the given graph. 
- Node 0 has 2 edges
- Node 1 has 1 edge
- Node 2 has 1 edge
- Node 3 has 4 edges
- Node 4 has 2 edges
- Node 5 has 5 edges
- Node 6 has 3 edges
- Node 7 has 5 edges
- Node 8 has 1 edge
- Node 9 has 4 edges

Now we will find the 3-stars in the graph:
1. From the adjacency list, we can see the following 3-stars:
   - <0, (3, 7, 9)>
   - <3, (0, 6, 7)>
   - <5, (2, 4, 7)>
   - <5, (4, 7, 8)>
   - <5, (7, 8, 9)>
   - <6, (1, 3, 9)>
   - <7, (4, 5, 9)>
   - <9, (3, 5, 6)>
   
Count of 3-stars found: 8
Therefore, the final answer is [8].
