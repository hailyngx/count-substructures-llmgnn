Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, and node 7

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:
1. For node 0: No 3-star is formed since it is connected to 2 nodes only.
2. For node 1: No 3-star is formed since it is connected to 4 nodes and not exactly 3.
3. For node 2: No 3-star is formed since it is connected to 3 nodes but not exactly 3.
4. For node 3: 3-stars formed:
   - <3, (0, 1, 2)>
   - <3, (1, 2, 6)>
   - <3, (2, 1, 6)>
5. For node 4: No 3-star is formed since it is connected to 2 nodes only.
6. For node 5: No 3-star is formed since it is connected to 4 nodes and not exactly 3.
7. For node 6: No 3-star is formed since it is connected to 2 nodes only.
8. For node 7: No 3-star is formed since it is connected to 3 nodes but not exactly 3.
9. For node 8: No 3-star is formed since it is connected to 2 nodes only.
10. For node 9: No 3-star is formed since it is connected to 2 nodes only.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3] and they are <3, (0, 1, 2)>, <3, (1, 2, 6)>, and <3, (2, 1, 6)>.
