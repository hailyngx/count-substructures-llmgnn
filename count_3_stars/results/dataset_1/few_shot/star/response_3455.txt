Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Based on the definition of a 3-star, we are looking for nodes that have exactly 3 neighbors (leaves) and form a star pattern.

Looking at the provided graph and adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-star structures:

<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<1, (0, 3, 9)>
<6, (0, 7, 8)>
<8, (2, 3, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
