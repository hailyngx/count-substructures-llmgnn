Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 3

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can apply the definition of a 3-star, which consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

First, let's identify the 3-star patterns in the graph:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 4, 6. <0, (2, 4, 6)>
- Node 0 forms another 3-star with nodes 4, 8, 9. <0, (4, 8, 9)>
- Node 0 forms one more 3-star with nodes 6, 8, 9. <0, (6, 8, 9)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 7, not included since it's not a 3-star.
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 9, 3. <2, (0, 9, 3)>
- Node 3 does not form a 3-star as it is not connected to exactly three nodes.
- Node 4 does not form a 3-star as it is not connected to exactly three nodes.
- Node 5 does not form a 3-star as it is not connected to exactly three nodes.
- Node 6 does not form a 3-star since it doesn't have nodes connected to it to form a 3-star.
- Node 7 does not form a 3-star since it doesn't have nodes connected to it to form a 3-star.
- Node 8 does not form a 3-star since it doesn't have nodes connected to it to form a 3-star.
- Node 9 does not form a 3-star since it is not a central node in any 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (2, 4, 6)>
- <0, (4, 8, 9)>
- <0, (6, 8, 9)>
