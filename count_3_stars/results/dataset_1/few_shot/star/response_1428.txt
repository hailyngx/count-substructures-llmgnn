Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a 3-star pattern. 

Analyzing the graph based on the provided information, we can identify the following 3-stars: 

<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<1, (0, 5, 9)>
<2, (0, 4, 8)>
<3, (4, 8, 9)>
<4, (2, 3, _)>
<5, (0, 1, 7)>
<8, (2, 3, 9)>
<9, (1, 3, 8)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we have identified 8 unique instances. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8]. 

Therefore, the final answer is [8].
