Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 5, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern with that node as the center.

Observing the given graph, we find the following 3-star patterns:
<0, (1, 4, 8)>
<1, (0, 2, 8)>
<2, (1, 3, 5)>
<4, (0, 7, 9)>
<5, (2, 3, 7)>
<7, (4, 5, 9)>
<8, (0, 2, 9)>
<9, (4, 5, 7)>

Counting all these unique 3-stars, we get a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
