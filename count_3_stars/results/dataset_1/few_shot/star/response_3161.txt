Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 7, and node 8

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (5, 6, 8)>
<2, (3, 6, 8)>
<4, (7, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 2, 4)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we have a total of [4] 3-stars in the graph.
