Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Since a 3-star consists of a central node connected to three other nodes, we will look for nodes with exactly three edges.

Looking at the given adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<4, (0, 3, 7)>
<9, (1, 6, 8)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we have found a total of [2] 3-stars.
