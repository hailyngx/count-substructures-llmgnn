Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 9) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Upon examining the adjacency list of each node, we find that:
- Node 2 is connected to exactly 3 other nodes: 0, 7, and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to exactly 2 other nodes: 2 and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to exactly 1 other node: 9.
- Node 1 is connected to exactly 1 other node: 9.

Therefore, the 3-stars in the given graph are: 
<2, (0, 7, 9)>
<7, (2, 9)>
<3, (9)>
<1, (9)>

Count of 3-stars: [4]
