Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 7) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 5

Response:
In this graph, we can identify the 3-stars by looking for nodes with exactly three neighbors where one of the neighbors is a common node. Let's find all the 3-stars in this graph.

The nodes with exactly three neighbors are:
- Node 2 with neighbors 5, 3, 7
- Node 4 with neighbors 9, 5, 0
- Node 6 with neighbors 3, 5, 0
- Node 8 with neighbors 0, 5, 9

Therefore, there are 4 unique 3-stars in this graph.
