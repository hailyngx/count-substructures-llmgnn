Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 6

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the graph. Central nodes are nodes connected to exactly three other nodes. In this case, nodes 0, 4, and 6 are central nodes.

Let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph.

1. For central node 0:
<0, (6, 7, 8)>
<0, (6, 7, 8)>
Total: 2

2. For central node 4:
<4, (1, 5, 7)>
Total: 1

3. For central node 6:
<6, (0, 2, 7)>
<6, (0, 8, 9)>
<6, (2, 7, 8)>
<6, (7, 8, 9)>
Total: 4

[Total number of 3-stars in the given graph: 7]
