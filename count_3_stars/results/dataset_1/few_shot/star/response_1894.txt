Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 0) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 7
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 7

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:
[<0, (2, 4, 9)>, <9, (1, 4, 7)]]

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
