Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 7

Response:
First, let's find all the 3-star configurations in this graph:

1. <0, (1, 6, 8)>
2. <1, (0, 6, 8)>
3. <2, (6, 7, 8)>
4. <2, (6, 8, 9)>
5. <3, (6, 7, 9)>
6. <5, (8, 9, 0)>
7. <6, (0, 1, 8)>
8. <6, (2, 7, 8)>
9. <6, (2, 8, 9)>
10. <6, (3, 7, 9)>
11. <8, (0, 1, 6)>
12. <8, (2, 5, 9)>
13. <9, (2, 3, 7)>
14. <9, (2, 5, 0)>

Counting all unique 3-star configurations, we find that there are [14] 3-stars in the given graph.
