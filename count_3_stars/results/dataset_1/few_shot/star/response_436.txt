Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will identify all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. These structures represent 3-star graphs.

Let's list the unique 3-stars below:

1. <0, (2, 4, 7)>
2. <4, (0, 6, 7)>
3. <6, (4, 8, 9)>
4. <7, (0, 2, 4)>
5. <8, (4, 6, 7)>
