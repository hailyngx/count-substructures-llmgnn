Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 7
