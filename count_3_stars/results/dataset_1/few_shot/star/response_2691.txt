Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 8

Response:
The 3-star graph is characterized by a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. In this given graph, we have the following 3-stars:

<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<0, (4, 8, 9)>
<4, (0, 3, 8)>
<4, (0, 3, 5)>
<4, (3, 5, 8)>
<5, (0, 2, 3)>
<8, (0, 4, 9)>
<8, (4, 9, 0)>
<8, (4, 9, 6)>
<9, (0, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
