Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 7

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph:

1. <0, (2, 3, 5)>
2. <2, (0, 3, 7)>
3. <3, (0, 2, 4)>
4. <4, (1, 3, 5)>
5. <5, (0, 4, 6)>
6. <7, (1, 4, 9)>

Now let's count the total number of 3-star graphs in the given graph.
