Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the 3-stars based on the definition provided.

Given the number of nodes and edges, and the adjacency list for each node, we look for each potential central node and check if it has exactly three edges stemming from it. If it does, we form a 3-star centered at that node.

Here are the 3-stars found in the graph along with their respective central nodes:

<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<2, (1, 3, 5)>
<2, (0, 3, 1)>
<2, (3, 1, 5)>
<2, (5, 7, 8)>
<2, (7, 5, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
