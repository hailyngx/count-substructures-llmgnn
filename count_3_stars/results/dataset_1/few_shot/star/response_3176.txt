Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 6, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern.

Looking at the adjacency list, we see that the nodes and their connections are as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 7
- Node 1 is connected to node 6
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 4 and 6
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 5, and 7
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 8, and 9
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 7
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 8, and 9
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 5, and 9
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 9
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 4, 6, 7, and 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. <0, (3, 5, 7)>
2. <2, (4, 6, 8)>
3. <2, (4, 6, 9)>
4. <4, (2, 8, 9)>
5. <6, (1, 8, 9)>
6. <6, (2, 8, 9)>
7. <8, (4, 6, 9)>
8. <9, (4, 6, 8)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
