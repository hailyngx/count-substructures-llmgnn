Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's determine the unique 3-stars present. 

Let's start by identifying the 3-stars:

1. <0, (2, 3, 8)>
2. <1, (3, 4, 8)>
3. <2, (0, 3, 8)>
4. <3, (0, 1, 2)>
5. <4, (1, 5, 8)>
6. <5, (1, 3, 4)>
7. <6, (3, 4, 5)>
8. <8, (0, 1, 2)>
9. <9, (4, 8,  )]
    
Since node 9 only has one connection to node 8, it cannot form a 3-star. Therefore, such a 3-star will be considered invalid.

Counting the valid 3-stars, the final answer is: [8].
