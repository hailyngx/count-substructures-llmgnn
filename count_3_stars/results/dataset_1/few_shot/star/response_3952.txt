Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star. Remember that a 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Nodes with the correct number of connections:
- Node 0 is a potential center of a 3-star as it is connected to 3 other nodes (4, 5, 6).
- Node 4 is a potential center as it is also connected to 3 other nodes (0, 3, 6).
- Node 5 is a potential center as it is connected to 3 other nodes (0, 1, 6).
- Node 6 is a potential center as it is connected to 6 other nodes (0, 1, 4, 5, 7, 9).

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- The 3-star with center node 0: <0, (4, 5, 6)>
- The 3-star with center node 4: <4, (0, 3, 6)>
- The 3-star with center node 5: <5, (0, 1, 6)>
- The 3-star with center node 6: <6, (0, 1, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
