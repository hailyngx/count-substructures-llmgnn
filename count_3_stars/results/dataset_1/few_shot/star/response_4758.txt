Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, and node 7

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 4, and 6 <0, (2, 4, 6)>
- Node 0 forms another 3-star with nodes 4, 6, and 9 <0, (4, 6, 9)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 6, and 7 <1, (3, 6, 7)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 6, and 9 <2, (0, 6, 9)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 6, and 9 <3, (4, 6, 9)>
- Node 4 forms two 3-stars as mentioned above
- Node 5 does not form any 3-star
- Node 6 forms multiple 3-stars:
  - With nodes 0, 1, and 2 <6, (0, 1, 2)>
  - With nodes 0, 3, and 4 <6, (0, 3, 4)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 8, and 9 <7, (1, 8, 9)>
- Node 8 does not form any 3-star
- Node 9 forms multiple 3-stars:
  - With nodes 0, 4, and 6 <9, (0, 4, 6)>
  - With nodes 4, 7, and 9 <9, (4, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
