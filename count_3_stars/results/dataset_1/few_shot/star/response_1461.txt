Response:
First, let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

Since a 3-star has one central node and three leaves, we can iterate through each node and check if it satisfies the conditions of being a central node of a 3-star. A central node has degree 3 in a 3-star.

Looking at the adjacency list, nodes 0, 4, 7, 8, and 9 have degree 3, so they can potentially be central nodes of 3-stars.

Let's analyze each potential central node:

1. Node 0:
    - Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 8, 9.
    - 3-stars with node 0 as the central node: 
        <0, (2, 8, 9)>
    - Since we've considered node 0, we can skip nodes 2, 8, and 9 as central nodes.

2. Node 4:
    - Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3.
    - 3-stars with node 4 as the central node: 
        <4, (0, 1, 3)>
    - Since we've considered node 4, we can skip nodes 0, 1, and 3 as central nodes.

3. Node 7:
    - Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 6.
    - <7, (2, 5, 6)>
    - Here, we cannot skip any other nodes.

4. Node 8:
    - Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 9.
    - <8, (0, 9, -)>
    - In this case, we can skip node 9.

5. Node 9:
    - Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 8.
    - <9, (0, 8, -)>
    - In this case, we can skip node 8.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (2, 8, 9)>, 
<4, (0, 1, 3)>, 
<7, (2, 5, 6)>, 
<8, (0, 9, -)>, 
<9, (0, 8, -)>
