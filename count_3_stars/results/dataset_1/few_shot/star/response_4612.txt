Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
To count the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star structure. 

Let's go through each node to identify the 3-stars:

1. For Node 0:
   - <0, (2, 3, 4)>
   - <0, (2, 4, 8)>
   - <0, (3, 4, 8)>

2. For Node 1:
   - No 3-star structure with Node 1 as the center.

3. For Node 2:
   - No 3-star structure with Node 2 as the center.

4. For Node 3:
   - No 3-star structure with Node 3 as the center.

5. For Node 4:
   - <4, (0, 1, 6)>
   - <4, (0, 1, 7)>
   - <4, (0, 6, 7)>

6. For Node 5:
   - No 3-star structure with Node 5 as the center.

7. For Node 6:
   - No 3-star structure with Node 6 as the center.

8. For Node 7:
   - No 3-star structure with Node 7 as the center.

9. For Node 8:
   - No 3-star structure with Node 8 as the center.

The unique 3-stars in the graph are <0, (2, 3, 4)>, <0, (2, 4, 8)>, <0, (3, 4, 8)>, <4, (0, 1, 6)>, <4, (0, 1, 7)>, and <4, (0, 6, 7)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [6].
