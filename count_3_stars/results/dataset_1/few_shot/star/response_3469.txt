Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's start by listing the unique 3-stars:

    <0, (2, 3, 4)>
    <0, (2, 3, 5)>
    <0, (2, 3, 6)>
    <0, (2, 3, 9)>
    <0, (2, 4, 5)>
    <0, (2, 4, 6)>
    <0, (2, 4, 9)>
    <0, (2, 5, 6)>
    <0, (2, 5, 9)>
    <0, (2, 6, 9)>
    <0, (3, 4, 5)>
    <0, (3, 4, 6)>
    <0, (3, 4, 9)>
    <0, (3, 5, 6)>
    <0, (3, 5, 9)>
    <0, (3, 6, 9)>
    <0, (4, 5, 6)>
    <0, (4, 5, 8)>
    <0, (4, 5, 9)>
    <0, (4, 6, 8)>
    <0, (4, 6, 9)>
    <0, (4, 8, 9)>
    <1, (3, 5, 9)>
    <4, (5, 6, 9)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars:
