Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph and list the unique 3-stars, we will first identify all possible 3-stars where the central node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

To find the 3-stars, we follow these steps:
1. Identify nodes with degree greater than or equal to 3 as potential central nodes.
2. For each potential central node, check if it has exactly three neighbors.
3. If a potential central node has three neighbors, form a 3-star using it as the center and its neighbors as leaves.
4. Count the total number of unique 3-stars found.

Let's start by identifying the potential central nodes:
- Node 0, 3, 4, and 6 have a degree equal to 4, making them potential central nodes.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars by checking each potential central node:
- For Node 0: (0, 1, 3, 7), (0, 1, 7, 9)
- For Node 3: (3, 0, 5, 6)
- For Node 4: (4, 1, 6, 8)
- For Node 6: (6, 3, 4, 7), (6, 4, 5, 7)

Putting all unique 3-stars together, we get: 
<0, (1, 3, 7)>, <0, (1, 7, 9)>, <3, (0, 5, 6)>, <4, (1, 6, 8)>, <6, (3, 4, 7)>, <6, (4, 5, 7)>
Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
