Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 4
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Since a 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can go through each node and identify if it forms a 3-star structure.

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 0: <0, (2, 5, 6)>
2. Node 1: Not a center of a 3-star
3. Node 2: <2, (0, 4, 5)> 
4. Node 3: Not a center of a 3-star
5. Node 4: Not a center of a 3-star
6. Node 5: <5, (0, 2, 3)> 
7. Node 6: <6, (0, 2, 3)>
8. Node 7: Not a center of a 3-star
9. Node 8: Not a center of a 3-star
10. Node 9: Not connected to any other nodes, so it cannot be a center of a 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3]. 
The unique 3-stars are <0, (2, 5, 6)>, <2, (0, 4, 5)>, and <5, (0, 2, 3)>.
