Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 5

Response:
The number of 3-star graphs can be counted by finding all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through the list of nodes and their connections to identify the 3-stars:

1. Node 0: (1, 3, 4), (1, 3, 6), (1, 4, 6), (3, 4, 6)
2. Node 1: (0, 2, 3), (0, 3, 6)
3. Node 2: (1, 3, 4), (1, 3, 7), (1, 4, 7), (3, 4, 7)
4. Node 3: (0, 1, 2), (0, 2, 4), (0, 2, 8), (0, 4, 6), (0, 4, 8), (0, 6, 8)
5. Node 4: (0, 2, 5), (0, 2, 7), (0, 5, 7)
6. Node 5: (2, 4, 6), (2, 4, 7), (2, 6, 7)
7. Node 6: (0, 1, 3), (0, 1, 5), (0, 3, 5)
8. Node 7: (2, 4, 5), (2, 5, 6)
9. Node 8: (2, 3, 5)
10. Node 9: (2, 3, 5)

Thus, the 3-stars in the given graph are:
<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<2, (1, 3, 4)>
<4, (0, 2, 5)>
<5, (2, 4, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
