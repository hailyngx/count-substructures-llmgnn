Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 6
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars in this graph:
<0, (2, 6, 5)>
<1, (5, 9, 8)>
<2, (4, 5, 6)>
<4, (2, 7, 5)>
<5, (1, 2, 6)>
<7, (4, 9, 8)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars in the graph gives us a total of [6].
