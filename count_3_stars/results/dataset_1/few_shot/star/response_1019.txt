Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern with itself as the center and the three connected nodes as leaves.

Based on the provided graph information, the nodes and their connections, we can identify the following 3-stars:
1. <2, (1, 7, 8)>
2. <3, (5, 8, 9)>
3. <5, (3, 7, 8)>
4. <7, (2, 5, 8)>
5. <8, (2, 3, 6)>
6. <9, (3, 8, 0)>  (Note: Node 9 is connected to Node 0)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
