Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 6

Response:
To identify the 3-stars in this graph, we need to find the central node and the nodes connected to it. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. From the adjacency list, we can see that the nodes 1, 2, 6, 7, 8, and 9 have at least three connections, so they have the potential to be central nodes of 3-stars.

2. Let's start by examining each of these potential central nodes:
    - For node 1, the nodes connected to it are 2, 7, and 9.
    - For node 2, the nodes connected to it are 1, 6, and 7.
    - For node 6, the nodes connected to it are 2, 3, 8, and 9.
    - For node 7, the nodes connected to it are 0, 1, and 2.
    - For node 8, the nodes connected to it are 5 and 6.
    - For node 9, the nodes connected to it are 1 and 6.

3. Now, let's list out the unique 3-stars based on the potential central nodes:
    - <1, (2, 7, 9)>
    - <2, (1, 6, 7)>
    - <6, (2, 3, 8)>
    - <7, (0, 1, 2)>
    - <8, (5, 6)>
    - <9, (1, 6)>

4. Counting the number of unique 3-stars gives us [6]. 

Final result: [6]
