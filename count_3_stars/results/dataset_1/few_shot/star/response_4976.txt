Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Looking at the adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars:

<1, (2, 5, 7)>
<5, (1, 4, 6)>
<7, (0, 1, 3)>
<9, (0, 4, 7)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars found in the graph.
