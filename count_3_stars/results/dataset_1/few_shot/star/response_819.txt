Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 5, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star configuration.

Let's analyze the graph based on the given information:

1. Node 0: (3, 7, 9)
   - <0, (3, 7, 9)>

2. Node 1: (5, 6, 8)
   - <1, (5, 6, 8)>

3. Node 2: (3, 6, 7) and (3, 7, 9)
   - <2, (3, 6, 7)>
   - <2, (3, 7, 9)>

4. Node 3: (0, 2, 5)
   - <3, (0, 2, 5)>

5. Node 4: (7, 8, 9)
   - <4, (7, 8, 9)>

6. Node 5: (1, 3, 9)
   - <5, (1, 3, 9)>

7. Node 6: (1, 2, 8)
   - <6, (1, 2, 8)>

8. Node 7: (0, 2, 4) and (2, 4, 9)
   - <7, (0, 2, 4)>
   - <7, (2, 4, 9)>

9. Node 8: (1, 4, 6)
   - <8, (1, 4, 6)>

10. Node 9: (0, 4, 7) and (2, 5, 7)
    - <9, (0, 4, 7)>
    - <9, (2, 5, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
