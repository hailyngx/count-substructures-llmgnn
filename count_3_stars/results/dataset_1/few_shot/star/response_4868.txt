Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 46 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star shape.

Based on the provided adjacency list and understanding of 3-star graphs, we can identify the following unique 3-stars:
  
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<0, (2, 6, 7)>
<0, (2, 8, 6)>
<2, (0, 5, 6)>
<2, (0, 7, 8)>
<2, (0, 9, 6)>
<4, (0, 1, 5)>
<4, (0, 5, 8)>
<4, (0, 8, 9)>
<6, (0, 2, 7)>
<6, (0, 7, 8)>
<6, (0, 9, 7)>
<7, (0, 2, 8)>
<7, (0, 6, 8)>
<7, (0, 8, 7)>
<8, (0, 2, 6)>
<8, (0, 4, 7)>
<8, (0, 6, 7)>

Thus, the total number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [18].
