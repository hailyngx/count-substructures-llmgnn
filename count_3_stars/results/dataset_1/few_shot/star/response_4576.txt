Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible 3-stars, which consist of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes.

In this graph, the nodes with the appropriate connections to form 3-stars are:  
- Node 0: (1, 2, 8)
- Node 2: (0, 3, 9)
- Node 9: (1, 2, 8) and (2, 5, 8)

Finding all 3-stars that can be formed:
<0, (1, 2, 8)>
<2, (0, 3, 9)>
<9, (1, 2, 8)>
<9, (2, 5, 8)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
