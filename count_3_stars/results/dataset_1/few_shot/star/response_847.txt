Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 7
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 2
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first identify each 3-star in the graph. 

Based on the definition of a 3-star graph, a 3-star can be formed when a center node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Here are the unique 3-stars in the given graph:
<0, (6, 7, 8)>
<1, (3, 6, 7)>
<1, (3, 6, 8)>
<1, (6, 7, 8)>

Now, we can count the total number of 3-stars in the graph.
