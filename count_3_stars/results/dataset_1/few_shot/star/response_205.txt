Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify these 3-stars:

<0, (3, 8, 9)>
<1, (6, 7, 2)>
<2, (7, 8, 0)>
<3, (0, 7, 8)>
<4, (6, 9, 0)>
<5, (7, 1, 3)>
<6, (1, 7, 9)>
<7, (2, 1, 3)>
<8, (0, 2, 3)>
<9, (3, 4, 6)>

Now, we need to count the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph. 
Count: 10
