Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 4, 7, and node 8

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph:

1. Node 0 forms a 3-star: <0, (1, 3, 4)>
2. Node 2 forms a 3-star: <2, (1, 3, 6)>
3. Node 4 forms a 3-star: <4, (0, 6, 7)>
4. Node 9 forms a 3-star: <9, (2, 7, 8)>

Finally, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
