Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list down the 3-stars present in the graph:

<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<1, (0, 4, 6)>
<1, (2, 3, 5)>
<1, (4, 5, 8)>
<5, (1, 3, 6)>
<5, (8, 7, 9)>
<7, (8, 9, 5)>

Count of 3-stars: [7]
