Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will be the central nodes of the 3-stars. 

After examining the adjacency list for each node, the nodes that qualify as central nodes are:
- Node 0 (connected to nodes 4, 5, and 6)
- Node 2 (connected to nodes 1, 4, and 6)
- Node 9 (connected to nodes 1, 4, and 6)

Now, let's find the unique 3-stars:
<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<2, (1, 4, 6)>
<9, (1, 4, 6)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
