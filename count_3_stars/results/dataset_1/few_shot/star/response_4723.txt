Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a 3-star pattern.

Since the graph contains 10 nodes with specific edges, we can proceed by looking at each node in the adjacency list to find 3-stars. Let's identify the 3-stars:

<1, (4, 2, 5)>
<3, (6, 8, 5)>
<5, (9, 1, 4)>
<6, (7, 8, 3)>
<7, (9, 6, 5)>
<8, (9, 3, 6)>
<9, (7, 5, 8)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars found: [7]
