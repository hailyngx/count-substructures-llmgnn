Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 1) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the unique 3-stars present.
Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (3, 6, 7)>
<1, (3, 4, 9)>
<2, (8, 7, -)>
<3, (0, 1, -)>
<4, (1, -, -)>
<5, (7, -, -)>
<6, (0, 1, 9)>
<7, (0, 5, 8)>
<8, (2, 7, -)>
<9, (1, 6, 7)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the given graph: 
[9]
