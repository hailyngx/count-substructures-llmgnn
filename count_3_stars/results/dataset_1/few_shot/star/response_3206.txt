Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star present. 

Given the definition of a 3-star in the context of this graph, it will consist of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

In this case, the central node can only be nodes 1, 3, 4, 6, or 9 as they have degree 4. 

Let's list all the 3-stars:

<1, (2, 6, 7)>
<1, (2, 7, 9)>
<1, (6, 7, 9)>
<3, (4, 6, 7)>
<3, (4, 7, 9)>
<4, (1, 3, 6)>
<4, (1, 3, 7)>
<4, (1, 6, 9)>
<4, (1, 7, 9)>
<6, (1, 3, 7)>
<6, (1, 7, 9)>
<9, (1, 4, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [12].
