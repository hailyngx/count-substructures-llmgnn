Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node and the three leaves connected to it. A 3-star has the following structure: (Center, Leaf1, Leaf2, Leaf3).

Looking at the provided data, we notice that a 3-star can be formed with node 6 as the central node:

1. <6, (2, 4, 8)> 
2. <6, (4, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
