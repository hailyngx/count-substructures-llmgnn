Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 8

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph. 

Given the definition of a 3-star graph, we need to find nodes that have exactly 3 edges connected to them, forming a structure where one node (the center) is connected to three other nodes (the leaves).

Looking at the adjacency list, we can see that the nodes with exactly 3 edges connected to them are:
- Node 0 (connected to 4 and 6)
- Node 1 (connected to 2 and 6)
- Node 7 (connected to 4)
- Node 9 (connected to 3 and 8)

Next, we need to check if these nodes form 3-stars. Let's check the connections for each of these nodes:

Node 0: (0, 4) (0, 6) [3-star: <0, (4, 6)>]
Node 1: (1, 2) (1, 6) [No 3-star]
Node 7: (7, 4) [No 3-star]
Node 9: (9, 3) (9, 8) [No 3-star]

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1], and the unique 3-star found is <0, (4, 6)>.
