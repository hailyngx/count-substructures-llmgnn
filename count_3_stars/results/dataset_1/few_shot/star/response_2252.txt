Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's start by examining each node and its neighbors to identify the 3-stars.

Given the adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (1, 3, 7)>
<1, (0, 6, 7)>
<2, (3, 6, 7)>
<3, (0, 2, 8)>
<4, (6, 7, -)>
<5, (6, 9, -)>
<6, (1, 2, 4)>
<7, (0, 1, 2)>
<8, (3, -, -)>
<9, (0, 5, -)>

Now, we count the total number of unique 3-stars: 
[9]
