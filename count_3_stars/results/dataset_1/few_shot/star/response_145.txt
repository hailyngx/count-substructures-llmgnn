Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 4
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we first need to identify the 3-star structures present in the graph. As a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can identify them based on this definition. We will then count the total number of unique 3-stars.

Based on the given adjacency list and the definition of a 3-star, we can identify the following unique 3-stars:
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<1, (2, 4, 5)>
<4, (0, 1, 5)>
<7, (1, 8, *)> (Note: Node 7 serves as the center node, but there are only 2 connected nodes aside from the center; the third node could be any other node connected to node 7)

Therefore, there are [3] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
