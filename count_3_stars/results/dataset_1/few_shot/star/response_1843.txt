Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-star subgraphs, we need to identify each 3-star in the graph. A 3-star in this case will consist of a central node and three leaves connected to the central node. Let's identify the unique 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (2, 5, 9)>
2. <1, (4, 7, 9)>
3. <2, (0, 5, 7)>
4. <2, (5, 6, 8)>
5. <2, (7, 8, 9)>
6. <4, (1, 9, 7)>
7. <5, (2, 6, 7)>
8. <6, (5, 7, 8)>
9. <7, (1, 6, 8)>
10. <8, (2, 6, 7)>
11. <9, (2, 4, 7)>
  
Counting the unique 3-stars seen above, we find that there are [11] 3-star subgraphs in the given graph.
