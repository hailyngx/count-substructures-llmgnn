Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. We can look for nodes that have exactly two edges connected to them (excluding the edge connecting them to the center node).

Based on the given information, let's identify the 3-stars:

- Node 0 has 2 edges: (0, 7) and (0, 9)
  <0, (7, 9)>

- Node 1 has 2 edges: (1, 2) and (1, 5)
  <1, (2, 5)>

- Node 2 has 3 edges: (2, 1), (2, 5), and (2, 7)
  <2, (1, 5, 7)>

- Node 3 has 2 edges: (3, 5) and (3, 8)
  <3, (5, 8)>

- Node 6 has 3 edges: (6, 5), (6, 7), and (6, 8)
  <6, (5, 7, 8)>

- Node 9 has 2 edges: (9, 0) and (9, 3)
  <9, (0, 3)>

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
