Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 7) (1, 9) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, 7, and node 8

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph step by step. 

1. Identify all nodes connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 0, Node 5, and Node 7 are connected to 3 other nodes each.

2. For each of these nodes, check if they form a 3-star:
- For Node 0: (0, 4, 5, 7) is not a 3-star as there are more than 3 nodes connected to Node 0.
- For Node 5: (5, 0, 8) is not a 3-star as there are only 2 nodes connected to Node 5.
- For Node 7: (7, 0, 1, 8) and (7, 1, 8, 9) are not 3-stars as there are more than 3 nodes connected to Node 7.

3. Calculate the number of 3-stars found:
- No valid 3-stars were found.
