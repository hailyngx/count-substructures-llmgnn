Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a 3-star pattern. Let's list the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<1, (0, 2, 4)>
<2, (0, 1, 4)>
<3, (5, 8, 9)>
<4, (1, 2, 7)>
<5, (3, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
