Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern where a node is connected as the center to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the given graph, we can see that the following 3-stars exist:
<0, (2, 4, 7)>
<0, (4, 7, 8)>
<4, (0, 1, 6)>
<4, (1, 2, 6)>
<4, (2, 6, 9)>
<5, (2, 3, 6)>
<5, (3, 6, 7)>
<5, (6, 7, 5)>
<7, (0, 5, 9)>

Therefore, there are a total of [8] 3-star patterns in the given graph.
