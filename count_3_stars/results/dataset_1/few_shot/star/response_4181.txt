Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through each node and find the 3-stars.

Starting from each node:
1. Node 0: No 3-star centered at node 0 since it is connected to only 2 nodes.

2. Node 1: <1, (0, 5, 7)>

3. Node 2: No 3-star centered at node 2 since it is connected to only 1 node.

4. Node 3: <3, (0, 6, 7)>

5. Node 4: No 3-star centered at node 4 since it is not connected to any other nodes.

6. Node 5: <5, (1, 2, 7)>, <5, (1, 7, 8)>

7. Node 6: No 3-star centered at node 6 since it is connected to only 2 nodes.

8. Node 7: No additional 3-star centered at node 7 since we already counted <1, (0, 5, 7)> and <3, (0, 6, 7)>.

9. Node 8: No 3-star centered at node 8 since it is connected to only 2 nodes.

10. Node 9: No 3-star centered at node 9 since it is connected to only 1 node.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
Unique 3-stars: 
<1, (0, 5, 7)>
<3, (0, 6, 7)>
<5, (1, 2, 7)>
<5, (1, 7, 8)>
