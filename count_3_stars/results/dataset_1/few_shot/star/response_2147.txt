Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 6

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph step-by-step. 

1. First, let's identify the central node and its adjacent nodes for each node:
   - Node 0: (2, 3, 6, 7, 9)
   - Node 1: (2, 3, 4, 7)
   - Node 2: (0, 1)
   - Node 3: (0, 1, 6, 7)
   - Node 4: (1, 6, 7, 9)
   - Node 5: (7, 9)
   - Node 6: (0, 3, 4, 9)
   - Node 7: (0, 1, 3, 4, 5)
   - Node 8: Not connected to any other nodes.
   - Node 9: (0, 4, 5, 6)

2. From the given information, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:
   <0, (2, 3, 6)>
   <0, (2, 3, 7)>
   <0, (2, 3, 9)>
   <0, (2, 6, 7)>
   <0, (2, 6, 9)>
   <0, (3, 6, 7)>
   <0, (3, 6, 9)>
   <0, (3, 7, 9)>
   <0, (6, 7, 9)>
   <1, (2, 3, 4)>
   <1, (2, 3, 7)>
   <1, (2, 4, 7)>
   <1, (3, 4, 7)>
   <3, (0, 1, 6)>
   <3, (0, 1, 7)>
   <3, (1, 4, 7)>
   <4, (1, 6, 7)>
   <4, (1, 6, 9)>
   <4, (1, 7, 9)>
   <4, (6, 7, 9)>
   <6, (0, 3, 4)>
   <6, (0, 3, 9)>
   <6, (3, 4, 7)>
   <7, (0, 1, 4)>
   <7, (1, 4, 5)>
   <7, (1, 4, 6)>
   <7, (1, 5, 9)>
   <7, (4, 5, 9)>
   <9, (0, 4, 5)>
   <9, (0, 4, 6)>
   <9, (0, 5, 6)>
   <9, (4, 5, 6)>
   <9, (5, 6, 7)>
   
   Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [32].
