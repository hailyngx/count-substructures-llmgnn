Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 2, and 5. <0, (1, 2, 5)>
2. Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 3, and 5. <2, (0, 3, 5)>
3. Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 7, and 8. <5, (0, 7, 8)>
4. Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 3, and 7. <6, (2, 3, 7)>
5. Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 5, and 0. <8, (2, 5, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
