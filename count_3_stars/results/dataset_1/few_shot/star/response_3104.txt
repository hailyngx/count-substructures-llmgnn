Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 3

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all unique 3-stars. 

Let's go through the graph:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 5, and 9: <0, (4, 5, 9)>
- Node 1 does not form any 3-star since it has only two connected nodes.
- Node 2 does not form any 3-star since it has more than three connected nodes.
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 5, and 7: <3, (2, 5, 7)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 6, and 8: <4, (0, 6, 8)>
- Node 5 does not form any 3-star since it has more than three connected nodes.
- Node 6 does not form any 3-star since it has more than three connected nodes.
- Node 7 does not form any 3-star since it has more than three connected nodes.
- Node 8 does not form any 3-star since it has more than three connected nodes.
- Node 9 does not form any 3-star since it has only two connected nodes.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are: 
<0, (4, 5, 9)>, <3, (2, 5, 7)>, <4, (0, 6, 8)>

As there are 3 unique 3-stars, the final answer is [3].
