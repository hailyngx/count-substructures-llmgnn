Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes (forming a 3-star). Let's go step-by-step to find and count these 3-stars:

1. Nodes with exactly three neighbors are potential centers of 3-stars. Let's identify these nodes:
   - Node 1 has neighbors 6 and 9.
   - Node 2 has neighbors 5 and 6.
   - Node 4 has neighbors 5, 6, and 9.
   - Node 5 has neighbors 2, 4, and 9.
   - Node 6 has neighbors 1, 2, and 8.
   - Node 9 has neighbors 1, 4, and 5.

2. Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found: 
   - <1, (6, 9)>
   - <2, (5, 6)>
   - <4, (5, 6, 9)>
   - <5, (2, 4, 9)>
   - <6, (1, 2, 8)>
   - <9, (1, 4, 5)>

3. Finally, let's count the total number of 3-stars in this graph: 
   - There are 6 unique 3-stars based on the identified combinations above.

Therefore, the final answer is [6].
