Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 9
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star structure. 

Looking at the given graph, the central node in a 3-star structure must have exactly 3 edges connected to it (since a 3-star has 3 leaves). 

Let's list the 3-stars in this graph by identifying the central node and its 3 leaves:

<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<4, (1, 3, 9)>
<5, (0, 2)>
<7, (0, 2, 9)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
