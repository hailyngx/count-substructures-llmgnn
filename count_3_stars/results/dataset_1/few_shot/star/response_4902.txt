Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 8

Response:
First, let's identify all 3-stars in the graph:
1. Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 4, and 5: <0, (3, 4, 5)>
2. Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 7, and 8: <0, (3, 7, 8)>
3. Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 3, and 7: <0, (4, 3, 7)>
4. Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 7, and 8: <0, (5, 7, 8)>
5. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 6, and 7: <1, (2, 6, 7)>
6. Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 6, and 7: <2, (1, 6, 7)>
7. Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 8, and 9: <5, (7, 8, 9)>
8. Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 2, and 7: <6, (1, 2, 7)>
9. Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 5, and 9: <8, (7, 5, 9)>
10. Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 5, and 8: <9, (6, 5, 8)>

There are a total of 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the final answer is [10].
