Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 5

Response:
The 3-stars in this graph are:

<0, (2, 3, 6)>
<0, (2, 6, 7)>
<1, (6, 8, 9)>
<2, (0, 5, 6)>
<3, (0, 4, 8)>
<4, (3, 5, 9)>
<5, (2, 4, 9)>
<6, (0, 1, 2)>
<7, (0, 8, 7)>
<8, (1, 3, 7)>
<9, (1, 5, 9)>
