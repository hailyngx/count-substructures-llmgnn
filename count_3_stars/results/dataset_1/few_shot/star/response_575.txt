Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to find all possible unique combinations where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Here are the steps to identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Identify nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them. These nodes could potentially be the centers of 3-stars.
2. For each of these identified nodes, check if the nodes at the other end of its edges also form a 3-star pattern around it.

Let's go through the process step by step:

Nodes with exactly three edges connected to them:
- Node 2 (connected to nodes 1, 4, and 9)
- Node 3 (connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, and 9)
- Node 8 (connected to nodes 6 and 9)

Now, we check each of these nodes to see if they form a 3-star pattern around them:

For Node 2:
- <2, (1, 4, 9)> (3-star)

For Node 3:
- <3, (0, 1, 4)> (3-star)
- <3, (1, 4, 9)> (3-star)

For Node 8:
- No 3-star can be formed as it has only 2 connected nodes besides itself.

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is: [2]

The unique 3-stars are:
- <2, (1, 4, 9)>
- <3, (0, 1, 4)>
