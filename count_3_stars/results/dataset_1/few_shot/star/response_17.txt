Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 8

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

Looking at the edges and adjacency list, we can identify the 3-star structures:
1. 3-star centered at node 0: <0, (4, 6, 7)>
2. 3-star centered at node 1: <1, (3, 4, 5)>, <1, (4, 7, 9)>, <1, (5, 7, 9)>
3. 3-star centered at node 2: <2, (3, 9)>
4. 3-star centered at node 3: <3, (1, 2, 5)>
5. 3-star centered at node 4: <4, (0, 1, 6)>, <4, (1, 6, 8)>
6. 3-star centered at node 5: <5, (1, 3, 7)>, <5, (1, 7, 9)>
7. 3-star centered at node 6: <6, (0, 4, 7)>
8. 3-star centered at node 7: <7, (0, 1, 5)>, <7, (0, 5, 6)>
9. 3-star centered at node 8: <8, (4, 9)>
10. 3-star centered at node 9: <9, (1, 5, 7)>, <9, (1, 7, 8)>

Thus, there are a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph. 
The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 6, 7)>, <1, (3, 4, 5)>, <1, (4, 7, 9)>, <1, (5, 7, 9)>, <2, (3, 9)>, <3, (1, 2, 5)>, <4, (0, 1, 6)>, <4, (1, 6, 8)>, <5, (1, 3, 7)>, <5, (1, 7, 9)>, <6, (0, 4, 7)>, <7, (0, 1, 5)>, <7, (0, 5, 6)>, <8, (4, 9)>, <9, (1, 5, 7)>, <9, (1, 7, 8)>
