Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 5

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 

To count the number of 3-stars, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star configuration. Let's list them step-by-step:

1. For Node 4:
   Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.
   This forms two 3-stars with Node 4 as the central node: <4, (0, 5, 8)> and <4, (6, 7, 9)>.
   
2. For Node 5:
   Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 7, 8, and 9.
   This forms one 3-star with Node 5 as the central node: <5, (0, 4, 8)>.
   
Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<4, (0, 5, 8)>
<4, (6, 7, 9)>
<5, (0, 4, 8)>
