Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, first, we identify the central nodes with exactly 3 neighbors (leaves). Then, we check for each central node if its neighbors form a 3-star configuration. 

Given the adjacency list, the central nodes with exactly 3 neighbors are nodes 0, 3, and 8. Let's check their neighbors to find the 3-stars:

For Node 0:
- <0, (2, 6, 8)>
- [1]

For Node 3:
- <3, (2, 4, 8)>
- [1]

For Node 8:
- <8, (0, 3, -)>
- [1]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3]. 
The unique 3-stars found are <0, (2, 6, 8)>, <3, (2, 4, 8)>, and <8, (0, 3, -)>.
