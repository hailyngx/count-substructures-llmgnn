Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's go through the adjacency list for each node:

1. Node 0: Connected to nodes 3, 4, 6, 7, 9
2. Node 1: Connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8
3. Node 2: Connected to nodes 1, 6
4. Node 3: Connected to nodes 0, 1, 4
5. Node 4: Connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, 5, 8, 9
6. Node 5: Connected to node 4
7. Node 6: Connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 9
8. Node 7: Connected to nodes 0, 1
9. Node 8: Connected to nodes 1, 4
10. Node 9: Connected to nodes 0, 4, 6

From the adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars:

<0, (3, 4, 6)>
<0, (3, 4, 9)>
<0, (4, 6, 9)>
<1, (2, 6, 8)>
<1, (3, 4, 8)>
<1, (4, 6, 8)>
<4, (0, 3, 9)>
<4, (0, 6, 9)>
<4, (3, 5, 8)>
<4, (5, 8, 9)>
<4, (6, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10] when counting unique instances only.
