Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, and node 7

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the answer is [4].
      
Unique 3-stars: 
<1, (2, 4, 7)>
<1, (3, 7, 9)>
<1, (4, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 6, 9)>
