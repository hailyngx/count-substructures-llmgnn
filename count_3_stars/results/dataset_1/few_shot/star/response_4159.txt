Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star. 

Let's first find all the 3-stars in the graph based on the definition provided:
1. A 3-star involves a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Based on the adjacency list, the central nodes along with their connected nodes are:
- Node 0: 3, 5, 6, 7, 8
- Node 2: 3, 7, 9
- Node 3: 0, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8
- Node 5: 0, 3, 9
- Node 6: 0, 9
- Node 7: 0, 2, 3
- Node 8: 0, 1, 3
- Node 9: 2, 5, 6

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<0, (3, 7, 8)>
<3, (0, 2, 4)>
<3, (0, 5, 7)>
<3, (0, 7, 8)>
<5, (0, 3, 9)>
<6, (0, 9, 8)>
<9, (2, 5, 6)>

Count of 3-stars: [7]
