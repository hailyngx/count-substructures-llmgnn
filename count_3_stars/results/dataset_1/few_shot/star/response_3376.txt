Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a 3-star pattern.

Given the graph information, here are the 3-stars found:

[<0, (2, 8, 9)>]
[<1, (2, 5, 6)>]
[<2, (0, 1, 3)>]
[<2, (0, 1, 7)>]
[<2, (1, 3, 7)>]
[<8, (0, 3, 6)>]
[<8, (0, 3, 7)>]
[<8, (1, 3, 7)>]

After counting all unique 3-stars, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
