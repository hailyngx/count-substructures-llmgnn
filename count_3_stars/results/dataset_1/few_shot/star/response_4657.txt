Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-star configurations in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern.

After examining the adjacency list for each node, we can list the unique 3-star configurations:

<0, (3, 1, 1)>
<2, (4, 5, 7)>
<5, (2, 3, 4)>
<6, (1, 2, 1)>

Therefore, there are a total of [4] 3-stars in the given graph.
