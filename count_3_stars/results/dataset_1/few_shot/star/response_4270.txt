Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 7) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 5

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star pattern. 

Given the adjacency list and the definition of a 3-star graph, we can see that only nodes 0, 1, 5, and 8 have 3 edges connected to them. These nodes are the potential centers of 3-star graphs.

Let's go through each potential center node and list the unique 3-stars they form:

For node 0:
- <0, (4, 6, 8)>
- <0, (4, 6, 8)>
- <0, (4, 6, 8)>
  
For node 1:
- <1, (2, 5, 9)>
- <1, (2, 5, 9)>
  
For node 5:
- <5, (1, 8, 9)>
- <5, (1, 8, 9)>
  
For node 8:
- <8, (0, 5, 9)>
  
Counting the unique 3-stars, we find that there are [7] 3-stars in total. 

Therefore, the final answer is [7].
