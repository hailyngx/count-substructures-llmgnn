Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 6, and node 8

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

From the adjacency list, we can see that the nodes with exactly three neighbors are:
- Node 0
- Node 1
- Node 3
- Node 4
- Node 6
- Node 9

For each of these nodes, we can see if they form a 3-star by checking their neighbors. 

Let's start with node 0:
Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 8. This forms a 3-star with node 0 as the center and nodes 2, 3, and 8 as the leaves. So, we have <0, (2, 3, 8)>.

Moving on to node 1:
Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 6. This forms a 3-star with node 1 as the center and nodes 2, 5, and 6 as the leaves. So, we have <1, (2, 5, 6)>.

Next, node 3:
Node 3 is connected to nodes 0 and 7. Although node 3 has only two neighbors, it cannot form a 3-star.

Moving on to node 4:
Node 4 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 7. This forms a 3-star with node 4 as the center and nodes 5, 6, and 7 as the leaves. So, we have <4, (5, 6, 7)>.

Next, node 6:
Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 5, and 9. This forms two 3-stars with node 6 as the center:
1. <6, (1, 4, 5)>
2. <6, (4, 5, 9)>

Lastly, node 9:
Node 9 is connected to nodes 6 and 8. Although node 9 has only two neighbors, it cannot form a 3-star.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (2, 3, 8)>, <1, (2, 5, 6)>, <4, (5, 6, 7)>, and <6, (1, 4, 5)>.
