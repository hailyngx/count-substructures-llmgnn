Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 6
