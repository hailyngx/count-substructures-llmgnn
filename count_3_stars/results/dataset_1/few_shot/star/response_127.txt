Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 6

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible 3-stars by looking for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step by step:

1. Identify nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, 5, and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0 and 3.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 6.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0 and 6.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 6 and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 3, 6, and 7.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 6.

2. Assemble the identified 3-stars:
- <0, (2, 3, 9)>
- <0, (4, 3, 6)>
- <0, (5, 6, 9)>
- <3, (0, 2, 9)>
- <3, (4, 6, 8)>
- <3, (9, 0, 6)>
- <6, (4, 0, 3)>
- <6, (5, 0, 9)>
- <6, (7, 8, 3)>
- <6, (9, 0, 3)>

3. Count the total number of unique 3-stars: [9] 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
