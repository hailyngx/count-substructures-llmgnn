Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 2

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star, which consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through the nodes one by one to find the 3-stars:

1. For Node 0:
   - Node 0 does not form a 3-star because it does not have 3 neighbors.

2. For Node 1:
   - <1, (0, 5, 6)>
   - <1, (2, 5, 6)>
   - <1, (5, 6, 7)>

3. For Node 2:
   - Node 2 does not form a 3-star because it does not have 3 neighbors.

4. For Node 3:
   - Node 3 does not form a 3-star because it does not have 3 neighbors.

5. For Node 4:
   - Node 4 does not form a 3-star because it does not have 3 neighbors.

6. For Node 5:
   - Node 5 does not form a 3-star because it does not have 3 neighbors.

7. For Node 6:
   - <6, (0, 4, 8)>
   - <6, (1, 3, 8)>
   - <6, (3, 4, 8)>

8. For Node 7:
   - Node 7 does not form a 3-star because it does not have 3 neighbors.

9. For Node 8:
   - Node 8 does not form a 3-star because it does not have 3 neighbors.

10. For Node 9:
   - Node 9 does not form a 3-star because it does not have 3 neighbors.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3]. 
The unique 3-stars are: <1, (0, 5, 6)>, <1, (2, 5, 6)>, and <1, (5, 6, 7)>.
