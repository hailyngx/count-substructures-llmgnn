Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all possible 3-stars by finding the central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

1. Identify the potential central nodes:
   - Nodes with degree 3 can be potential central nodes: Nodes 1, 3, and 9.

2. For each potential central node, check if it forms a 3-star:
   
   Potential central node: 1
   - (1, 2, 4) forms a 3-star with node 1 as the center. <1, (2, 4, 5)>
   
   Potential central node: 3
   - (3, 4, 5) forms a 3-star with node 3 as the center. <3, (4, 5, 7)>
   
   Potential central node: 9
   - (9, 2, 7) forms a 3-star with node 9 as the center. <9, (2, 3, 7)>
   
Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
