Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 7

Response:
Let's find the 3-star graphs in the given graph:

1. Node 1: (2, 5, 6)
2. Node 2: (1, 6, 8)
3. Node 4: (6, 8, 0)
4. Node 5: (1, 2, 3)
5. Node 6: (1, 2, 4)
6. Node 8: (2, 4, 5)

Count of 3-stars: [6]
