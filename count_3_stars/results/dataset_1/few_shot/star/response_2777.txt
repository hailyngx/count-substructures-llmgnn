Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 5, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible 3-stars. 

Let's start by listing the 3-stars using the adjacency list provided:

<0, (5, 6, 7)>
<1, (4, 6, 7)>
<2, (3, 6, 8)>
<3, (2, 6, 9)>
<4, (1, 6, 9)>
<5, (0, 8, 9)>
<6, (0, 1, 2), (0, 3, 4), (1, 2, 3), (1, 4, 7), (2, 8, 9), (5, 9, 8), (7, 9, 0)>
<7, (0, 1, 6), (0, 6, 9)>
<8, (2, 5, 9)>
<9, (2, 3, 4), (3, 5, 7), (4, 6, 1), (5, 8, 9), (7, 0, 9)>

After listing all the possible 3-stars, we can count them to get the total number of 3-stars which is [13].
