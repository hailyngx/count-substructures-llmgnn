Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 6) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 2) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 2

Response:
Let's first identify the central nodes in this graph. Central nodes are nodes with exactly 3 neighbors.

From the adjacency list, the central nodes are: 0, 2, 6.

Next, we want to count the number of 3-stars in this graph.

Let's start with the central node 0:
- <0, (2, 4, 6)>
- Total 3-stars centered at 0: 1

Move on to central node 2:
- <2, (0, 8, 9)>
- Total 3-stars centered at 2: 1

Finally, central node 6:
- <6, (0, 4, 7)>
- Total 3-stars centered at 6: 1

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is: [3].
