Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, 8, and node 9

Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern. 

Let's consider each node as the potential center of a 3-star and identify the 3-stars around it:
- Node 0 cannot form a 3-star as it is connected to 3 nodes (4, 5, 6).
- Node 1 cannot form a 3-star as it is connected to 4 nodes (2, 4, 8, 9).
- Node 2 forms a 3-star: <2, (1, 4, 5)>
- Node 3 cannot form a 3-star as it is connected to 2 nodes (6, 9).
- Node 4 forms a 3-star: <4, (0, 1, 2)>
- Node 5 cannot form a 3-star as it is connected to 2 nodes (0, 2).
- Node 6 forms a 3-star: <6, (0, 2, 3)>
- Node 7 cannot form a 3-star as it is connected to 3 nodes (2, 6, 9).
- Node 8 cannot form a 3-star as it is connected to 1 node (1).
- Node 9 cannot form a 3-star as it is connected to 4 nodes (1, 3, 6, 7).

The 3-stars identified are: 
<2, (1, 4, 5)>, <4, (0, 1, 2)>, <6, (0, 2, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
