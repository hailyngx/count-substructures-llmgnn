Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 3

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern with the connected nodes. 

Looking at the adjacency list for each node, we can identify the following 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (3, 7, 8)>
<1, (3, 5, 6)>
<2, (4, 9, 3)>
<3, (0, 1, 5)>
<4, (0, 2, 6)>
<5, (1, 3, -)>
<6, (1, 4, 7)>
<7, (0, 3, 4)>
<8, (0, -, -)>
<9, (1, 2, 3)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we find there are 9 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [9].
