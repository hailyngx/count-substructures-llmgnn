Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the possible 3-stars. 

Let's list the possible 3-star configurations based on the graph information provided:
1. Node 0: adjacent to nodes 1, 2, 4
   <0, (1, 2, 4)>
   
2. Node 1: adjacent to nodes 0, 3, 7, 8, 9
   <1, (0, 7, 8)>
   <1, (0, 3, 9)>
   
3. Node 2: adjacent to nodes 0, 3, 7
   <2, (0, 3, 7)>
   
4. Node 3: adjacent to nodes 1, 2, 8
   <3, (1, 8, 2)>
   
5. Node 4: adjacent to node 0
   (This is not a 3-star structure since it does not have 3 connected nodes)

6. Node 6: adjacent to node 4
   (This is not a 3-star structure since it does not have 3 connected nodes)

7. Node 7: adjacent to nodes 0, 1, 2, 9
   <7, (0, 1, 9)>
   <7, (0, 2, 9)>

8. Node 8: adjacent to nodes 1, 2, 3, 9
   <8, (1, 3, 9)>
   <8, (1, 2, 9)>
   
9. Node 9: adjacent to nodes 1, 3, 7, 8
   <9, (1, 3, 8)>
   <9, (1, 7, 8)>

Combining all unique 3-star configurations, the final count of 3-stars in the given graph is [11], and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 2, 4)>, <1, (0, 7, 8)>, <1, (0, 3, 9)>, <2, (0, 3, 7)>, <3, (1, 8, 2)>, <7, (0, 1, 9)>, <7, (0, 2, 9)>, <8, (1, 3, 9)>, <8, (1, 2, 9)>, <9, (1, 3, 8)>, <9, (1, 7, 8)>
