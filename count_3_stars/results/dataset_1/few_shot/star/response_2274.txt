Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 8) (6, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's start by identifying the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 4, and 6: <0, (3, 4, 6)>
2. Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 8, and 9: <4, (0, 8, 9)>
3. Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 8, and 9: <6, (0, 8, 9)>
4. Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 4, and 6: <9, (3, 4, 6)>

Therefore, there are a total of [4] 3-stars in the given graph.
