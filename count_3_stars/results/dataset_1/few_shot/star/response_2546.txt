Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. We will then identify the unique 3-stars based on the central node and the three leaves.

Here are the 3-stars found in the given graph:

[4]
<0, (2, 4, 7)>
<1, (3, 4, 7)>
<2, (0, 7, 9)>
<3, (1, 4, 9)>
<4, (0, 1, 7)>
<6, (4, 5, 8)>
<7, (0, 1, 2)>
<9, (2, 3, 5)>

Total number of 3-stars: [8]
