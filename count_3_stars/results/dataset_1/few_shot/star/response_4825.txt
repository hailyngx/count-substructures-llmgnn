Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 9
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 4

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph:

Nodes with 3 neighbors:
- Node 0
- Node 3
- Node 4

Now, let's identify the unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<3, (0, 1, 4)>
<4, (0, 2, 3)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we have a total of [3] 3-stars in the graph.
