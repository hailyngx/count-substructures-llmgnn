Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 7
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 8

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are:

<1, (2, 6, 8)>
<3, (4, 6, 8)>
<3, (4, 8, 9)>
<8, (1, 3, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
