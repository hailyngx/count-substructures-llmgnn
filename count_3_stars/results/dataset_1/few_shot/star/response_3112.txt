Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern. 

There are 3 such 3-stars in the given graph. 

[3]

Unique 3-stars: 
<0, (1, 3, 9)>
<3, (0, 5, 8)>
<4, (2, 6, 9)>
