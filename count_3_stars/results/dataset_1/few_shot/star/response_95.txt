Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 9
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the unique instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's analyze the graph to determine the 3-stars present.

Considering the adjacency list provided, let's list out the 3-star configurations:

<0, (9, 2, 4)>  
<2, (4, 6, 9)>  
<2, (6, 3, 4)>  
<2, (9, 0, 4)>  
<3, (1, 5, 6)>  
<4, (9, 2, 6)>  
<6, (2, 4, 5)>  
<9, (0, 2, 4)>  

Counting all the unique 3-stars, we find that there are [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
