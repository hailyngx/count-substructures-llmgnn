Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:
<0, (7, 9)>
<1, (4, 5, 7)>
<1, (5, 6, 9)>
<3, (4, 6, 8)>
<5, (1, 6, 9)>
<6, (2, 3, 5)>
<7, (0, 1, 9)>
<7, (1, 8, 9)>
