Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all possible 3-stars in the graph based on the definition provided.

Based on the definition of a 3-star graph, we need to find all instances where a node in the graph is connected to exactly 3 other nodes.

In the given graph, the possible 3-stars are:
<2, (0, 4, 5)>
<4, (2, 5, 9)>
<5, (2, 4, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].  
The unique 3-stars found are: 
<2, (0, 4, 5)>
<4, (2, 5, 9)>
<5, (2, 4, 9)>
