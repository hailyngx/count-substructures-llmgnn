Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 4

Response:
Based on the given graph, we can identify the 3-stars present. Let's list them step by step:

1. From the adjacency list, we can see that nodes 0, 2, and 7 are potential central nodes as they have degree 3.
2. For these central nodes:
   - Node 0 has neighbors 2, 4, 5, and 7.
   - Node 2 has neighbors 0, 4, and 7.
   - Node 7 has neighbors 0, 1, and 6.
3. Identifying the 3-stars:
   - For node 0: <0, (2, 4, 5)>, <0, (2, 4, 7)>
   - For node 2: <2, (0, 4, 7)>
   - For node 7: <7, (0, 1, 6)>

Count of 3-stars [] is [4].
Unique 3-stars found:
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<0, (2, 4, 7)>
<2, (0, 4, 7)>
<7, (0, 1, 6)>
