Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes forming a star pattern. Since a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can iterate through each node in the graph and check if it satisfies this property.

From the given adjacency list, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<3, (0, 1, 5)>
<4, (1, 2, 7)>
<5, (0, 2, 9)>
<6, (3, 7, 9)>
<7, (2, 4, 6)>
<8, (0, 3, 9)>
<9, (0, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
