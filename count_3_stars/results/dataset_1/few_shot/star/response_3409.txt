Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will form the center of the 3-star, and the nodes they are connected to will be the leaves of the 3-star.

Upon examining the adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars:

<1, (0, 3, 9)>
<3, (1, 2, 9)>
<3, (4, 5, 7)>
<5, (3, 4, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4]. 
<1, (0, 3, 9)>, <3, (1, 2, 9)>, <3, (4, 5, 7)>, <5, (3, 4, 6)>
