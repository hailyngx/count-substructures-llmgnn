Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 7

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 0: <0, (3, 4, 5)>
2. Node 2: <2, (4, 8, 9)>
3. Node 4: <4, (0, 1, 2)>
4. Node 7: <7, (4, 9, -)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the given graph.
