Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 7

Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify these 3-stars step by step:

1. Nodes with exactly three neighbors:
   - Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 7
   - Node 2 is connected to nodes 3 and 8

2. For each of these nodes, we check if they form a 3-star:
   - Node 1 can form a 3-star with nodes 3, 4, and 7: <1, (3, 4, 7)>
   - Node 2 cannot form a 3-star because it doesn't have exactly three neighbors

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars in the given graph is [1]. 

The 3-star found is: <1, (3, 4, 7)>
