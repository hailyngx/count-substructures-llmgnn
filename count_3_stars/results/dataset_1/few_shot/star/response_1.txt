Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star shape.

Looking at the provided graph and adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars in the graph:

[5]

Count of 3-stars: [1]
