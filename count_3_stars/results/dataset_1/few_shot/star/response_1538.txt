Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will look for each node that has exactly three neighbors and check if it forms a 3-star. 

Here are the steps:
1. Look for nodes with exactly three neighbors.
2. Check if these neighbors form a 3-star with the node at the center.

Let's find the 3-stars. 

1. Node 1: Neighbors are 3, 4, 8, 9. Forms a 3-star: <1, (3, 4, 8)>.
2. Node 2: Neighbors are 0, 3, 8. Forms a 3-star: <2, (0, 3, 8)>.
3. Node 3: Neighbors are 1, 2. Does not form a 3-star.
4. Node 4: Neighbors are 1, 8, 9. Forms a 3-star: <4, (1, 8, 9)>.
5. Node 5: Neighbors are 6, 7, 9. Forms a 3-star: <5, (6, 7, 9)>.
6. Node 7: Neighbors are 5, 6, 9. Forms a 3-star: <7, (5, 6, 9)>.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3]. 
The unique 3-stars found are <1, (3, 4, 8)>, <2, (0, 3, 8)>, and <5, (6, 7, 9)>.
