Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern. 

In a 3-star pattern, there is a central node connected to exactly three other nodes (leaves). Given the graph, we can identify the 3-star patterns as follows:
- For Node 0: <0, (1, 6, 8)>
- For Node 1: <1, (0, 2, 4)>, <1, (0, 3, 7)>, <1, (2, 3, 4)>, <1, (2, 4, 7)>
- For Node 2: <2, (1, 6, 7)>, <2, (1, 7, 8)>, <2, (6, 7, 8)>
- For Node 3: <3, (1, 4, 6)>, <3, (4, 6, 9)>
- For Node 4: <4, (1, 3, 7)>, <4, (1, 5, 7)>, <4, (3, 5, 7)>, <4, (3, 7, 9)>, <4, (5, 7, 9)>
- For Node 7: <7, (1, 2, 4)>, <7, (1, 4, 5)>, <7, (2, 4, 5)>
- For Node 9: <9, (3, 4, 6)>, <9, (3, 4, 7)>

Counting the total number of unique 3-star patterns gives us the number of 3-stars in the graph. 

Thus, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [16]. 
Unique 3-stars: <0, (1, 6, 8)>, <1, (0, 2, 4)>, <1, (0, 3, 7)>, <1, (2, 3, 4)>, <1, (2, 4, 7)>, <2, (1, 6, 7)>, <2, (1, 7, 8)>, <2, (6, 7, 8)>, <3, (1, 4, 6)>, <3, (4, 6, 9)>, <4, (1, 3, 7)>, <4, (1, 5, 7)>, <4, (3, 5, 7)>, <4, (3, 7, 9)>, <4, (5, 7, 9)>, <9, (3, 4, 6)>, <9, (3, 4, 7)>
