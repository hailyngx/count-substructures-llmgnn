Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a central node (with exactly 3 neighbors) forms a 3-star with its neighbors. 

Here are the unique 3-stars identified in the graph:

<1, (2, 6, 9)>
<2, (1, 6, 7)>
<3, (6, 9, -)>
<4, (9, -, -)>
<5, (0, 9, -)>

Count of 3-stars: [5]
