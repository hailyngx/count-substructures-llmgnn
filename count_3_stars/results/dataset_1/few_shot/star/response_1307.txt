Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will identify all the occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern. Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (2, 7, 9)>
<1, (3, 4, -)>
<2, (0, -, -)>
<3, (1, 8, -)>
<4, (1, 5, 8)>
<5, (4, 6, 7)>
<6, (5, -, -)>
<7, (0, 5, 9)>
<8, (3, 4, 5)>
<9, (0, 7, -)>

Count of 3-stars: [9]
