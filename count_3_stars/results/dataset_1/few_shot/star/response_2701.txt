Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 4, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for each node's neighbors and identify any 3-stars around them. 

Let's start by finding the 3-stars related to each node:
- Node 0: <0, (2, 5, 6)>
- Node 1: No 3-stars
- Node 2: <2, (0, 5, 9)>; <2, (1, 7, 8)>; <2, (5, 7, 9)> 
- Node 3: No 3-stars
- Node 4: <4, (6, 7, 9)>
- Node 5: <5, (0, 2, 9)>
- Node 6: No 3-stars
- Node 7: No 3-stars
- Node 8: No 3-stars
- Node 9: <9, (1, 2, 5)>; <9, (2, 3, 5)>; <9, (2, 4, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7]. 

<List of unique 3-stars>: 
<0, (2, 5, 6)>, <2, (0, 5, 9)>, <2, (1, 7, 8)>, <2, (5, 7, 9)>, <4, (6, 7, 9)>, <5, (0, 2, 9)>, <9, (1, 2, 5)>, <9, (2, 3, 5)>, <9, (2, 4, 7)>
