Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 6

Response:
First, let's examine each node in the graph to identify the 3-stars present.

Node 0: Not a part of any 3-star.
Node 1: <1, (2, 5, 9)>
Node 2: <2, (1, 6, 9)>
Node 3: Not a part of any 3-star.
Node 4: <4, (6, 9, 2)>
Node 5: Not a part of any 3-star.
Node 6: <6, (2, 4, 9)>
Node 7: Not a part of any 3-star.
Node 8: Not a part of any 3-star.
Node 9: <9, (1, 2, 4)>

Count of 3-stars in the given graph: [3].
