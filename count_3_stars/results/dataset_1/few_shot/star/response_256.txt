Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 7

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that can be the center of a 3-star graph. Since a 3-star graph has a center node connected to exactly three other nodes, we need to find nodes with at least three neighbors.

Nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, and 8 have at least three neighbors, so they can potentially be the center of a 3-star graph.

Next, let's examine each potential center node and identify the 3-stars they form:

For Node 0:
- <0, (1, 8)>
- [1 3-star]

For Node 2:
- <2, (3, 5, 8)>
- [1 3-star]

For Node 3:
- <3, (2, 4, 5)>
- [1 3-star]

For Node 4:
- <4, (3, 6, 5)>
- [1 3-star]

For Node 8:
- <8, (0, 2, 5)>
- [1 3-star]

Combining all unique 3-stars found, we get:
[5]
