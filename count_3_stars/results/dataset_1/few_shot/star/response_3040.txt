Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 4, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 6

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars. 

Let's go through each node and its neighbors to see if there are any 3-stars.

From the adjacency list:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2 and 3.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, and 8.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, and 7.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 3.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0 and 8.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0 and 3.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 2 and 5.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0 and 6.

Let's list the unique 3-stars: 
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<0, (3, 6, 7)>
<2, (0, 4, 6)>

There are [3] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
