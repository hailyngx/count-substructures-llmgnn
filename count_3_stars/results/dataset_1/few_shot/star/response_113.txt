Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Since a 3-star consists of a central node connected to three other nodes, we need to examine each node in the graph and check if it is part of a 3-star structure.

Upon inspection, we can find the following 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (1, 4, 8)>
<1, (0, 4, 9)>
<3, (4, 5, 6)>
<4, (0, 1, 9)>
<5, (3, 7, 8)>
<6, (3, 7, 8)>
<7, (2, 5, 6)>
<8, (0, 5, 9)>
<9, (1, 4, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
