Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 5) (3, 1) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 5
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph provided, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern. Let's start by listing all the 3-stars in the graph:

<1, (3, 6, 4)>
<6, (1, 5, 4)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
