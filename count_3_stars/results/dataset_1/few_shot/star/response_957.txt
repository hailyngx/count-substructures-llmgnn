Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 4, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 
Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 5, and 6: <1, (0, 5, 6)>
2. Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 8, and 9: <2, (5, 8, 9)>

So there are [2] 3-stars in the given graph.
