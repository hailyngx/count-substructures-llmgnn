Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 6

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

To form a 3-star, we need to find nodes that have exactly three neighbors, one of which should be a shared neighbor of the other two.

Nodes with 3 neighbors:
- Node 2: Connected to nodes 0, 1, 3
- Node 3: Connected to nodes 2, 5
- Node 6: Connected to nodes 0, 7, 8
- Node 8: Connected to nodes 4, 6, 7

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars in the graph:
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<3, (2, 5)>
<6, (0, 7, 8)>
<8, (4, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
