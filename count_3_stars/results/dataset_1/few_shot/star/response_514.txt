Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star. 

Looking at the given graph and adjacency list, we can determine the 3-stars as follows:

1. <0, (2, 4, 6)>
2. <1, (3, 7, 8)>
3. <2, (0, 4, 6)>
4. <3, (1, 7, 8)>
5. <4, (0, 1, 6)>
6. <5, (3, 7, 9)>
7. <6, (2, 4, 5)>
8. <7, (1, 3, 5)>
9. <8, (1, 3, 7)>
10. <9, (3, 4, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
