Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each occurrence of a 3-star pattern. 
A 3-star pattern consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the graph:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 5, 7, 8, and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to node 0.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 8, and 9.
- Node 4 is isolated.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 7, and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to node 0.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 5.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 3.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 5.

We can see there are 4 instances of 3-stars in this graph.

Therefore, the answer is:
[4]

The unique 3-stars in this graph are:
<0, (2, 3, 5)>
<0, (5, 6, 7)>
<1, (5, 7, 9)>
<3, (8, 9, 5)>
