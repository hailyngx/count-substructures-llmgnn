Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 1

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to look for structures where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's find all the 3-stars in this graph:

1. Node 1 is part of <1, (3, 4, 5)>, with edges (1,3), (1,4), and (1,5).
2. Node 3 is part of <3, (1, 6, 7)>, with edges (3,1), (3,6), and (3,7).
3. Node 5 is part of <5, (1, 2, 6)>, with edges (5,1), (5,2), and (5,6).
4. Node 6 is part of <6, (0, 3, 5)>, with edges (6,0), (6,3), and (6,5).
5. Node 9 is part of <9, (0, 1, 0)>, with edges (9,0), (9,1), and (9,0).

Therefore, we have found 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
