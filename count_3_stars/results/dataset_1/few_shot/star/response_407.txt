Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 3
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 6

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0: (1, 6, 7)
2. Node 1: (0, 3, 7)
3. Node 3: (1, 5, 7)
4. Node 6: (0, 7, 9)
5. Node 7: (0, 1, 2)
6. Node 9: (6)

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph.
