Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 7, and node 8

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph based on the definition provided.

The center and leaves for each 3-star will be as follows:
- Center: A node that has exactly three edges connecting it to other nodes.
- Leaves: The three nodes that are connected to the center node.

Looking at the given graph and information, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<1, (6, 7, 2)>
<2, (7, 6, 4)>
<7, (1, 2, 5)>
<9, (8, 7, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
