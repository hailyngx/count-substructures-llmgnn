Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 6

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

The 3-star structures in this graph are:
<0, (4, 6, 9)>
<1, (3, 5, 9)>
<4, (0, 6, 9)>
<5, (1, 2, 6)>
<6, (0, 4, 5)>
<9, (1, 4, 5)>

Counting the number of 3-stars, we have a total of [6] 3-stars in this graph.
