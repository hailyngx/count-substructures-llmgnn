Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 7

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars in the graph are:
<0, (2, 6, 7)>
<1, (5, 7, 8)>
<2, (0, 6, 9)>
<3, (4, 8, -)>
<4, (3, 5, -)>
<5, (1, 4, -)>
<6, (1, 2, 7)>
<7, (0, 1, 6)>
<8, (1, 3, -)>
<9, (2, 7, -)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we get a total of [9].
