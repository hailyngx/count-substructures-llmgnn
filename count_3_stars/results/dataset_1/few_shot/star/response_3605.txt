Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through each node and check if it is the central node of a 3-star graph.

Here are the 3-stars found in the graph:
<1, (4, 5, 6)>
<3, (4, 5, 6)>
<4, (0, 7, 1)>
<4, (1, 2, 3)>
<4, (3, 7, 5)>
<7, (3, 8, 9)>
<8, (1, 6, 7)>

Count of 3-stars: [7]
