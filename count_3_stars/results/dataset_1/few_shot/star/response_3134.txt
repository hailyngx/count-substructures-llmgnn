Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (6, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 7

Response:
First, let's find the 3-stars in the graph.

Possible 3-stars in the graph:
- <0, (2, 9)>
- <2, (0, 5)>
- <3, (4)>
- <4, (3, 6)>
- <7, (8, 9)>
- <8, (7)>
- <9, (0, 7)>

Count of 3-stars: [7]
