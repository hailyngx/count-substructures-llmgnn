Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where one node is connected to three other nodes. Let's go through the nodes to find the 3-stars:

- Node 2:
    - 3-star: <2, (0, 4, 5)>
    - 3-star: <2, (0, 4, 9)>
- Node 3:
    - 3-star: <3, (4, 6, 9)>
- Node 4:
    - 3-star: <4, (0, 2, 8)>
- Node 5:
    - No 3-stars as it is not connected to exactly 3 nodes.
- Node 6:
    - No 3-stars as it is not connected to exactly 3 nodes.
- Node 7:
    - No 3-stars as it is not connected to exactly 3 nodes.
- Node 8:
    - No 3-stars as it is not the central node of any 3-star.
- Node 9:
    - No 3-stars as it is not the central node of any 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is: [3].  
The unique 3-stars found are: <2, (0, 4, 5)>, <2, (0, 4, 9)>, and <3, (4, 6, 9)>.
