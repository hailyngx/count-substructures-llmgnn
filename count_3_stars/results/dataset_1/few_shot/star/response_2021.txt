Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 6, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star and then count them. Remember that a 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes.

The possible 3-stars in this graph are as follows:
<0, (3, 6, 8)>
<1, (6, 8, -)>
<2, (3, 4, 9)>
<3, (0, 2, -)>
<4, (2, -, -)>
<5, (6, -, -)>
<6, (0, 1, 5)>
<7, (9, -, -)>
<8, (0, 1, 9)>
<9, (2, 6, 7)>

Now, counting the unique 3-stars found, we have:
[9]
