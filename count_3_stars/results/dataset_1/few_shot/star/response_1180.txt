Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 4
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, and node 5

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that can serve as the center of a 3-star. The center node needs to be connected to exactly three other nodes. Based on the given adjacency list, nodes 0, 1, 2, and 5 satisfy this criterion.

Next, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- <0, (1, 8, 9)>
- <1, (0, 2, 9)>
- <2, (1, 5, 9)>
- <5, (2, 4, 8)>
- <5, (2, 8, 9)>
- <5, (4, 8, 9)>
- <8, (0, 5, 9)>
- <9, (0, 1, 5)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we get a total of [8].
