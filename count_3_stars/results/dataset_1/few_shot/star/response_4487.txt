Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, 6, and node 7

Response:
The central nodes for the 3-stars will be each node in the graph. We will check each node if it is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

1. For Node 0:
   Node 0 is not connected to exactly three other nodes, so it is not a central node for a 3-star.

2. For Node 1:
   Node 1 is connected to nodes 0 and 9. It is not connected to exactly three other nodes, so it is not a central node for a 3-star.

3. For Node 2:
   Node 2 is connected to nodes 3. It is not connected to exactly three other nodes, so it is not a central node for a 3-star.

4. For Node 3:
   Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 8, and 9. Node 3 forms the following 3-stars:
   <3, (2, 8, 9)>

5. For Node 4:
   Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes, so it is not a central node for a 3-star.

6. For Node 5:
   Node 5 is connected to nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9. It is not connected to exactly three other nodes, so it is not a central node for a 3-star.

7. For Node 6:
   Node 6 is connected to nodes 5 and 9. It is not connected to exactly three other nodes, so it is not a central node for a 3-star.

8. For Node 7:
   Node 7 is connected to nodes 5 and 9. It is not connected to exactly three other nodes, so it is not a central node for a 3-star.

9. For Node 8:
   Node 8 is connected to nodes 3 and 5. It is not connected to exactly three other nodes, so it is not a central node for a 3-star.

10. For Node 9:
   Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 5, 6, and 7. It is not connected to exactly three other nodes, so it is not a central node for a 3-star.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1], and the unique 3-star found is <3, (2, 8, 9)>.
