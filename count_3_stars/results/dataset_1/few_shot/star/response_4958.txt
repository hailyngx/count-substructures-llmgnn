Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star pattern. 

From the adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<1, (0, 2, 8)>
<2, (1, 6, 8)>
<3, (0, 7, 8)>
<5, (0, 6, 7)>
<6, (2, 5, 7)>
<7, (2, 3, 5)>
<8, (1, 2, 3)>
<9, (6, 8)>

By counting the unique 3-stars, we find that there are a total of 9 3-stars in the graph. 
Therefore, the final answer is [9].
