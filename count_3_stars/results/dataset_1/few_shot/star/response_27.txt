Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph (represented by the adjacency list and edge list provided), we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we identify the 3-star structures by finding nodes that have exactly three neighbors. Let's list the unique 3-stars found:

<0, (1, 6, 8)>  
<1, (0, 4, 9)>  
<2, (3, 5, 6)>  
<3, (2, 4, -)>  
<4, (1, 3, 8)>  
<5, (2, 6, 9)>  
<6, (0, 2, 8)>  
<7, (9, -,-)>  
<8, (1, 4, 6)>  
<9, (1, 5, 7)>  

Counting the number of unique 3-stars found in the given graph, we get a total of [9].
