Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 7

Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern. 

Let's identify the 3-stars step-by-step:
1. Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 5, forming a 3-star with node 1 as the center. (<1, (2, 4, 5)>)
2. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 5, forming a 3-star with node 2 as the center. (<2, (0, 1, 5)>)
3. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 5, forming a 3-star with node 3 as the center. (<3, (0, 4, 5)>)
4. Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 3, forming a 3-star with node 5 as the center. (<5, (1, 2, 3)>)
5. Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 7, forming a 3-star with node 6 as the center. (<6, (1, 2, 7)>)
6. Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 9, and 2, forming a 3-star with node 8 as the center. (<8, (1, 9, 2)>)
7. Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 8, forming a 3-star with node 9 as the center. (<9, (2, 5, 8)>) 

Now, count the number of unique 3-stars found: 
[7]
