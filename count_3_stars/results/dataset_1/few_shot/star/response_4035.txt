Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes as leaves. Let's go through the nodes and their connections to find all the 3-stars.

1. Node 0:
   Possible 3-stars:
   - <0, (1, 4, 7)>
   - <0, (1, 7, 8)>
   Total: 2

2. Node 1:
   Possible 3-stars:
   - <1, (0, 7, 9)>
   Total: 1

3. Node 2:
   Possible 3-stars: None (Not connected to three nodes)

4. Node 3:
   Possible 3-stars: None (Not connected to three nodes)

5. Node 4:
   Possible 3-stars: None (Not connected to three nodes)

6. Node 5:
   Possible 3-stars: None (Not connected to three nodes)

7. Node 6:
   Possible 3-stars: None (Not connected to any other nodes)

8. Node 7:
   Possible 3-stars:
   - <7, (0, 1, 8)>
   Total: 1

9. Node 8:
   Possible 3-stars:
   - <8, (0, 2, 9)>
   Total: 1

10. Node 9:
    Possible 3-stars: None (Not connected to three nodes)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
Unique 3-stars: 
<0, (1, 4, 7)>
<0, (1, 7, 8)>
<1, (0, 7, 9)>
<7, (0, 1, 8)>
<8, (0, 2, 9)>
