Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is the center of a 3-star. 

Let's analyze each node to see if it is the center of any 3-star:
1. Node 0: <0, (1, 6, 8)> (Since node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 6, and 8)
2. Node 1: <1, (0, 3, 9)> (Since node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 9)
3. Node 2: Not a center of any 3-star
4. Node 3: Not a center of any 3-star
5. Node 4: Not a center of any 3-star
6. Node 5: Not a center of any 3-star
7. Node 6: <6, (0, 4, 8)> (Since node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 8)
8. Node 7: <7, (0, 4, 8)> (Since node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 8)
9. Node 8: <8, (0, 6, 9)> (Since node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 6, and 9)
10. Node 9: <9, (1, 3, 8)> (Since node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 8)

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
<0, (1, 6, 8)>, <1, (0, 3, 9)>, <6, (0, 4, 8)>, <7, (0, 4, 8)>, <8, (0, 6, 9)>
