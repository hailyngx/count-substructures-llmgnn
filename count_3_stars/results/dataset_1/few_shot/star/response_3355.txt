Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star-like pattern. 

Looking at the given graph, we can identify the following 3-star patterns:

<0, (6, 7)>
<2, (4, 6)>
<4, (1, 2, 8)>
<8, (1, 4, 5)>

Count of 3-stars: [4]
Unique 3-stars: <0, (6, 7)>, <2, (4, 6)>, <4, (1, 2, 8)>, <8, (1, 4, 5)>
