Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern.

Looking at the graph and the given adjacency list:
- Node 0 has neighbors 1, 3, 6, but it has 4 neighbors. So, it doesn't form a 3-star.
- Node 1 has neighbors 0 and 3, but it doesn't form a 3-star.
- Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 3 has neighbors 0, 1, 4, 8, and 9. Possible 3-star with center node 3: <3, (0, 1, 9)>.
- Node 4 has neighbors 3, 5, 7, and 9, but node 7 is not connected to any other node. So, it doesn't form a 3-star.
- Node 5 has neighbors 4 and 8, but it doesn't form a 3-star.
- Node 6 has neighbors 0 and 9, but it doesn't form a 3-star.
- Node 7 is connected only to node 4, so it doesn't form a 3-star.
- Node 8 has neighbors 0, 3, and 5. Possible 3-star with center node 8: <8, (0, 3, 5)>.
- Node 9 has neighbors 3, 4, and 6. Possible 3-star with center node 9: <9, (3, 4, 6)>.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: <3, (0, 1, 9)> and <8, (0, 3, 5)>.
