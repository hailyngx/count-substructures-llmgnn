Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 3

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where there is a central node connected to exactly three other nodes (leaves).

Looking at the adjacency list provided:
- Node 0 has 3 connections: (2, 3, 9)
- Node 2 has 4 connections: (0, 3, 4, 7)
- Node 3 has 4 connections: (0, 2, 6, 9)
- Node 4 has 3 connections: (1, 2, 7)
- Node 5 has 1 connection: (8)
- Node 6 has 1 connection: (3)
- Node 7 has 3 connections: (2, 4, 8)
- Node 8 has 2 connections: (5, 7)
- Node 9 has 2 connections: (0, 3)

Observing the nodes, we can see the following 3-stars:
1. <0, (2, 3, 9)>
2. <2, (0, 3, 7)>
3. <3, (0, 2, 9)>
4. <4, (1, 2, 7)>
5. <7, (2, 4, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].  
The unique 3-stars are: <0, (2, 3, 9)>, <2, (0, 3, 7)>, <3, (0, 2, 9)>, <4, (1, 2, 7)>, <7, (2, 4, 8)>.
