Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 5

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph by looking for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

After analyzing the adjacency list, we find that there are two 3-stars in the given graph. 

The 3-stars are:
<2, (0, 5, 6)>
<7, (2, 4, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
