Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 7

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (4, 8)>
<1, (5, 6, 9)>
<4, (0, 2, 6)>
<5, (1, 6, 7)>
<6, (1, 4, 5)>
<9, (1, 5, 7)>
