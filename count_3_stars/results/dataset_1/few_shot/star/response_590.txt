Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern with that node being the center.

Let's list the 3-stars present in the graph:
<0, (4, 8, 9)>
<1, (3, 5, 8)>
<4, (0, 9, 8)>
<5, (1, 8, 8)>
<6, (7, 8, 9)>
<7, (6, 9, 8)>
<8, (0, 5, 6)>
<9, (4, 7, 8)>

Count of 3-stars: [8]
