Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Upon examining the given graph: 
- Node 0 is a 3-star center with leaf nodes 4, 5, and 7.
- Node 5 is a 3-star center with leaf nodes 0, 3, and 4.
- Node 8 is a 3-star center with leaf nodes 0, 7, and 9.

Hence, we have found three unique 3-stars: 
<0, (4, 5, 7)>
<5, (0, 3, 4)>
<8, (0, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
