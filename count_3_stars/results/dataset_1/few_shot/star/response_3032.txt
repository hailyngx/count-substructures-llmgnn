Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 4, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. These instances represent 3-stars in the graph.

Looking at the adjacency list for each node, we can identify the 3-stars as follows:
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with leaves 0, 1, and 2: <3, (0, 1, 2)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with leaves 4, 7, and 9: <5, (4, 7, 9)> 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
