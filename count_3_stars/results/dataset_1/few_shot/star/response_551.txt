Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we look for nodes that have exactly three neighbors. These nodes serve as the centers of the 3-star graphs.

We can identify the 3-stars as follows:
<1, (2, 4, 7)>
<4, (1, 2, 5)>
<7, (0, 1, 4)>
<9, (4, 6, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
