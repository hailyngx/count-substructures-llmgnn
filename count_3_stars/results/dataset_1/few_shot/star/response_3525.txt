Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the possible 3-stars. A 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

By looking at the given graph and the definition of a 3-star, we can identify the following unique 3-stars:
<2, (1, 3, 6)>
<3, (1, 2, 9)>
<4, (5, 9, 7)>
<5, (4, 9, 7)>
<6, (2, 7, 9)>
<7, (6, 9, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
