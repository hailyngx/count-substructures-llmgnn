Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: Identify the central nodes with exactly 3 neighbors (3-leaved nodes).  
- Central nodes are nodes 0, 2, 6, and 8.  

Step 2: For each central node, count the number of 3-stars it participates in:  
- For node 0:  
  - Node 0 is connected to nodes 5 and 6.  
  - Possible 3-stars centered at node 0:  
    - <0, (5, 6, x)>  
    - Count: 1  

- For node 2:  
  - Node 2 is connected to nodes 3 and 6.  
  - Possible 3-stars centered at node 2:  
    - <2, (3, 5, x)>  
    - Count: 1  

- For node 6:  
  - Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 8.  
  - Possible 3-stars centered at node 6:  
    - <6, (0, 2, x)>  
    - Count: 1  

- For node 8:  
  - Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 6, and 7.  
  - Not a central node with exactly 3 neighbors.  

Step 3: Calculate the total number of 3-stars in the given graph by summing up all individual counts:  
Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3  

Therefore, the final answer is [3].  
The unique 3-stars found are:  
- <0, (5, 6, x)>  
- <2, (3, 5, x)>  
- <6, (0, 2, x)>
