Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 8

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars present. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Based on the given graph and the definition of a 3-star, we can identify the following unique 3-stars:
<0, (2, 5, 9)>
<1, (5, 6, 9)>
<2, (0, 5, 7)>
<3, (0, 1, 7)>
<4, (5, 8, -)>
<5, (0, 1, 2)>
<6, (1, 2, 8)>
<7, (1, 2, 3)>
<8, (4, 6, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 8)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars found, we get a total of [9] 3-stars in the graph.
