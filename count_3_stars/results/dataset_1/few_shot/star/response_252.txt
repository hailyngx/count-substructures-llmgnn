Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (5, 3) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
Count of 3-stars: [2]

Unique 3-stars: 
<1, (0, 7, 8)>
<3, (4, 5, 8)>
