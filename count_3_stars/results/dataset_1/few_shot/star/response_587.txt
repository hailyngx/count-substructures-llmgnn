Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes and form 3-stars around them.

Here are the unique 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (6, 9)> - Forms a 3-star around node 0.
<2, (4, 8, 9)> - Forms a 3-star around node 2.
<5, (1, 2, 9)> - Forms a 3-star around node 5.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
