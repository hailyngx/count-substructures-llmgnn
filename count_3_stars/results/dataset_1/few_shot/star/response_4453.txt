Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star-like pattern.

Based on the given graph information and the definition of a 3-star graph, we can identify the following 3-stars:

<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<1, (3, 4, 7)>
<2, (1, 4, 6)>
<2, (4, 6, 8)>
<3, (1, 6, 7)>
<3, (6, 7, 8)>
<4, (1, 2, 7)>
<4, (2, 7, 8)>
<5, (7, 8, 9)>
<6, (2, 3, 8)>
<6, (3, 8, 9)>
<7, (3, 4, 5)>
<7, (4, 5, 9)>
<8, (5, 6, 9)>
<9, (0, 7, 8)>

Count the unique 3-stars listed above and provide the final answer inside brackets [].

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].
