Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star-like manner. Since the 3-star graph has a center node connected to exactly three other nodes, we will look for nodes that meet this criteria. 

Let's analyze the adjacency list for each node and identify the 3-stars:
1. Node 0: No 3-stars as it's connected to 2 nodes.
2. Node 1: No 3-stars as it's connected to 2 nodes.
3. Node 2: No 3-stars as it's connected to 2 nodes.
4. Node 3: <3, (0, 1, 7)> [1]
5. Node 4: No 3-stars as it's connected to 2 nodes.
6. Node 5: No 3-stars as it's connected to 1 node.
7. Node 6: No 3-stars as it's connected to 2 nodes.
8. Node 7: <7, (1, 3, 4)>, <7, (3, 4, 6)> [2]
9. Node 8: No 3-stars as it's connected to 3 nodes.
10. Node 9: No 3-stars as it's connected to 2 nodes.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].  
The unique 3-stars are: <3, (0, 1, 7)>, <7, (1, 3, 4)>, and <7, (3, 4, 6)>.
