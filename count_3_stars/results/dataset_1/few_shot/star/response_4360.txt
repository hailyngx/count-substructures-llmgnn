Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Taking a look at the adjacency list:
- Node 0, Node 4, and Node 6 satisfy the condition of being connected to exactly three other nodes.

Therefore, there are 3 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

[3]  
Unique 3-stars: 
<0, (2, 4, 9)>  
<4, (0, 6, 8)>  
<6, (2, 4, 9)>
