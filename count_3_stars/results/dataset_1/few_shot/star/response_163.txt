Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Based on the provided information, the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes are nodes 0, 3, and 7. Each of these nodes forms a 3-star with its directly connected nodes. 

Therefore, the <3, (0, 5, 8)>, <7, (0, 2, 5)>, and <0, (2, 3, 5)> are the three unique 3-stars in the graph. 

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
