Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through the nodes and their connections:
- Node 0: Not a 3-star as it is only connected to 1 node.
- Node 1: Not a 3-star as it is connected to 2 nodes.
- Node 2: Not a 3-star as it is connected to 3 nodes but not in a star configuration.
- Node 3: Not a 3-star as it is only connected to 1 node.
- Node 4: 3-star found: <4, (2, 5, 8)>
- Node 5: Not a 3-star as it is connected to 3 nodes but not in a star configuration.
- Node 6: Not a 3-star as it is only connected to 1 node.
- Node 7: Not a 3-star as it is connected to 2 nodes.
- Node 8: Not a 3-star as it is connected to 3 nodes but not in a star configuration.
- Node 9: Not a 3-star as it is only connected to 2 nodes.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1].
