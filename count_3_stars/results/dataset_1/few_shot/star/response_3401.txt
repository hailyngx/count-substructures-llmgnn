Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes with the central node being the one connected to all the other three nodes.

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in this graph:

<2, (5, 6, 7)>
<5, (2, 3, 6)>
<6, (2, 5, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
