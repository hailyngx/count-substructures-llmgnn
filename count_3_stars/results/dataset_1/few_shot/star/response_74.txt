Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the nodes that form 3-stars. 

Let's start by listing the 3-star patterns based on the definition:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 7, and 8 <0, (3, 7, 8)>
2. Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 4 <2, (1, 3, 4)>
3. Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 5 <4, (1, 2, 5)>
4. Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 5 <7, (0, 4, 5)>
5. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 9 <8, (0, 4, 9)>

Now, let's count the number of occurrences of these unique 3-stars in the graph.
