Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 6

Response:
We will identify the 3-stars in the graph by looking for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list the unique 3-stars found:

<0, (4, 6, 9)>
<1, (6, 0, 8)>
<2, (3, 8, 6)>
<3, (2, 5, 7)>
<4, (0, 5, 6)>
<5, (3, 4, 6)>
<6, (0, 1, 8)>
<7, (3, 2, 5)>
<8, (2, 6, 1)>
<9, (6, 0, 0)>

There are a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
