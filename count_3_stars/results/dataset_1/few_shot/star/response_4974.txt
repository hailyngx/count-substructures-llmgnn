Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Given the adjacency information, the 3-stars in this graph are as follows:
<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<1, (0, 6, 9)>
<2, (3, 7, 8)>
<3, (2, 4, 8)>
<4, (0, 3, 6)>
<5, (6, 8, 9)>
<6, (0, 5, 7)>
<7, (2, 6, 9)>
<8, (2, 5, 3)>
<9, (1, 6, 7)>

Count of 3-stars: [10]
