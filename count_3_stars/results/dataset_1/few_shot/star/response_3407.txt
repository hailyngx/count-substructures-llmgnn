Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star configuration. 

Based on the definition provided, a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<1, (2, 3, 4)>
<1, (4, 6, 8)>
<1, (2, 4, 8)>
<2, (1, 3, 4)>
<2, (1, 4, 9)>
<2, (4, 9, 3)>
<3, (1, 4, 9)>
<3, (1, 4, 5)>
<3, (4, 5, 9)>
<4, (1, 2, 3)>
<4, (1, 2, 8)>
<4, (1, 3, 5)>
<4, (2, 3, 9)>
<4, (8, 6, 1)>
<4, (8, 1, 6)>
<4, (8, 2, 1)>
<4, (8, 1, 2)>
<4, (8, 1, 3)>
<4, (8, 1, 9)>
<4, (8, 1, 5)>
<4, (8, 3, 9)>
<5, (3, 4, 9)>
<6, (1, 4, 8)>
<6, (1, 9, 3)>
<6, (1, 9, 5)>
<7, (4, 8, 1)>
<8, (1, 4, 6)>
<8, (2, 4, 1)>
<8, (4, 1, 2)>
<8, (4, 1, 3)>
<8, (4, 1, 9)>
<9, (2, 4, 3)>
<9, (2, 4, 1)>
<9, (2, 3, 5)>
<9, (2, 3, 4)>
<9, (3, 1, 5)>
<9, (3, 1, 6)>
<9, (3, 1, 4)>
<9, (3, 5, 2)>
<9, (3, 5, 4)>
<9, (3, 5, 1)>
<9, (3, 5, 6)>
<9, (5, 3, 9)>
<9, (5, 3, 4)>
<9, (5, 3, 1)>
<9, (6, 1, 9)>
<9, (6, 1, 3)>
