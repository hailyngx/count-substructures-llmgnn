Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Looking at the adjacency list, we can see that the nodes with proper 3-star connections are:
- Node 0: Connected to nodes 4, 5, 6
- Node 7: Connected to nodes 2, 5, 6
- Node 8: Connected to nodes 1, 3, 5

Let's list the unique 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<7, (2, 5, 6)>
<8, (1, 3, 5)>

Therefore, the number of unique 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
