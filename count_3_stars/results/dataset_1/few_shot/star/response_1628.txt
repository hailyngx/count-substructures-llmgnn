Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, creating a 3-star pattern.

Let's go through each node to find all the 3-stars:

1. Node 0: Not part of any 3-star.
2. Node 1: <1, (2, 4, 7)>
3. Node 2: <2, (1, 6, 7)>
4. Node 3: Not part of any 3-star.
5. Node 4: <4, (1, 5, 8)>
6. Node 5: <5, (0, 4, 7)>
7. Node 6: Not part of any 3-star.
8. Node 7: <7, (0, 1, 2)> and <7, (3, 5, 9)>
9. Node 8: Not part of any 3-star.
10. Node 9: Not part of any 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6]. 
The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (2, 4, 7)>
<2, (1, 6, 7)>
<4, (1, 5, 8)>
<5, (0, 4, 7)>
<7, (0, 1, 2)>
<7, (3, 5, 9)>
