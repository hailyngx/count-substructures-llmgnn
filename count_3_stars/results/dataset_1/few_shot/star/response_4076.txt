Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 8

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the given graph. 

We can see that a 3-star can be formed when a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list down all the 3-stars based on this information: 

<0, (1, 2, 6)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<3, (1, 5, 6)>
<4, (1, 7, 8)>
<5, (1, 3, 7)>
<6, (0, 1, 9)>
<7, (3, 4, 5)>
<8, (1, 4, 9)>
<9, (4, 6, 8)>

Now, we have found all possible 3-stars in the given graph. Let's count the total number of unique 3-stars. 

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
