Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 3

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for each node that is the center of a 3-star. 

By observing the adjacency list given:
- Node 1, 5, and 7 have degree 2, so they cannot be the center of a 3-star.
- Node 3 and 8 have degree 4, so they can potentially be the center of a 3-star.
- All other nodes have degree less than 3 and are not suitable to be the center of a 3-star.

Now let's find the 3-stars centered at nodes 3 and 8:

For Node 3:
- (3, 5, 6) forms a 3-star. (3 is the center, and 5, 6 are the leaves)
- (3, 5, 8) also forms a 3-star. (3 is the center, and 5, 8 are the leaves)
- (3, 6, 8) also forms a 3-star. (3 is the center, and 6, 8 are the leaves)
Therefore, for Node 3, there are 3 unique 3-stars: <3, (5, 6, 8)>

For Node 8:
- (8, 4, 5) forms a 3-star. (8 is the center, and 4, 5 are the leaves)
Therefore, for Node 8, there is 1 unique 3-star: <8, (4, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
