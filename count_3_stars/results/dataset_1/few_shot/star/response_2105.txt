Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 4, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star pattern.

Looking at the adjacency list:
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, and 8, forming a 3-star with nodes (0, 1, 2) as leaves. <3, (0, 1, 2)>
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 7, 8, and 9, forming a 3-star with nodes (3, 4, 7) as leaves. <6, (3, 4, 7)>
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3 and 9, forming a 3-star with nodes (3, 9) as leaves. <0, (3, 9)>
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3 and 9, forming a 3-star with nodes (3, 9) as leaves. However, this is already counted with node 0.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 3 and 8, forming a 3-star with nodes (3, 8) as leaves.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 3 and 5, but it does not form a 3-star since it has only 2 leaves.
- Node 5 does not form a 3-star as it is only connected to node 4.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 3 and 9, forming a 3-star with nodes (3, 9) as leaves. However, this is already counted with node 0.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 2 and 3, forming a 3-star with nodes (2, 3) as leaves.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 6, and 7, forming two 3-stars: <9, (0, 1, 6)> and <9, (0, 1, 7)>. 

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4]. The unique 3-stars found are <3, (0, 1, 2)>, <6, (3, 4, 7)>, <0, (3, 9)>, and <8, (2, 3)>.
