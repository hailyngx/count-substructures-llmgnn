Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 5

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the 3-stars by looking for nodes with exactly 3 neighbors. These nodes can potentially be the center of a 3-star.

Central Nodes: 2, 3, 4, 7

Next, we will check each central node and see if they are connected to exactly three other nodes, which would form a 3-star.

1. For node 2:
    Node 2 is connected to only one other node (node 6), so it cannot be the center of a 3-star.

2. For node 3:
    Node 3 is connected to two other nodes (node 1 and node 4), so it cannot be the center of a 3-star.

3. For node 4:
    Node 4 is connected to one other node (node 3), so it cannot be the center of a 3-star.

4. For node 7:
    Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes, so it cannot be the center of a 3-star.

Therefore, there are no 3-stars in this graph.
