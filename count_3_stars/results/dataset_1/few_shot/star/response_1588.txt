Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that satisfies the definition of a 3-star. 

Observations:
- Nodes connected to only one other node cannot form a 3-star.
- Nodes connected to two other nodes cannot form a 3-star.
- Nodes connected to three other nodes will form a 3-star.

Based on the given adjacency list and the definition of a 3-star, the nodes that can form 3-stars are 1, 3, 4, and 5. Let's analyze each of these nodes to count the total number of unique 3-stars:

For node 1:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 6.
- A 3-star can be formed with node 1 as the center. 
- <1, (4, 5, 6)>

For node 3:
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 6, and 9.
- A 3-star can be formed with node 3 as the center. 
- <3, (4, 5, 9)>

For node 4:
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 5, and 8.
- A 3-star can be formed with node 4 as the center. 
- <4, (1, 3, 8)>
- <4, (1, 5, 8)>
- <4, (3, 5, 8)>

For node 5:
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, and 9.
- A 3-star can be formed with node 5 as the center.
- <5, (1, 4, 8)>
- <5, (1, 3, 8)>
- <5, (1, 8, 9)>
- <5, (2, 4, 8)>
- <5, (2, 3, 8)>
- <5, (2, 8, 9)>
- <5, (3, 4, 8)>
- <5, (3, 8, 9)>

Counting the total number of unique 3-stars: 
[8]

<1, (4, 5, 6)>
<3, (4, 5, 9)>
<4, (1, 3, 8)>
<4, (1, 5, 8)>
<4, (3, 5, 8)>
<5, (1, 4, 8)>
<5, (1, 3, 8)>
<5, (1, 8, 9)>
<5, (2, 4, 8)>
<5, (2, 3, 8)>
<5, (2, 8, 9)>
<5, (3, 4, 8)>
<5, (3, 8, 9)>
