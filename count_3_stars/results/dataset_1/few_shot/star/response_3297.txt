Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 1

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 6, and 7: <0, (1, 6, 7)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 4, and 7: <1, (0, 4, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
