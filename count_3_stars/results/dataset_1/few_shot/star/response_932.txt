Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph and to list the unique 3-stars, we will focus on identifying nodes that are part of a 3-star pattern. 

From the given information, we can see that a 3-star pattern is formed when a node (center) is connected to exactly three other nodes (leaves). 

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph and then count them:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, and 8. This forms a 3-star: <0, (2, 3, 8)>
2. Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 5, 6, and 9. This forms two 3-stars: <7, (2, 3, 5)> and <7, (2, 3, 6)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].  
The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (2, 3, 8)>, <7, (2, 3, 5)>, and <7, (2, 3, 6)>
