Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 8

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star configurations in the given graph:

<2, (4, 7, 9)>
<8, (4, 7, 9)>
