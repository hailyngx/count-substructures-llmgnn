Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern.

Based on the provided adjacency list, the possible 3-star combinations are:
- Node 0: (3, 4, 9)
- Node 1: (7, 8, None) - Not a valid 3-star
- Node 2: (3, 4, 9)
- Node 3: (0, 2, 4) and (0, 2, 9)
- Node 4: (0, 2, 9)
- Node 5: (2, 3, 7)
- Node 6: (2, 3, 4)
- Node 7: (1, 5, None) - Not a valid 3-star
- Node 8: (1, 2, None) - Not a valid 3-star
- Node 9: (0, 2, 4)

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the graph are:
<0, (3, 4, 9)>
<2, (3, 4, 9)>
<3, (0, 2, 4)>
<3, (0, 2, 9)>
<4, (0, 2, 9)>

Count the number of unique 3-stars found inside brackets []: [5]
