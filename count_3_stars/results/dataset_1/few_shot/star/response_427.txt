Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, and node 7

Response:
Initially, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
1. Node 0 is not part of any 3-stars as it does not have three neighbors.
2. Node 1 is not part of any 3-stars as it does not have three neighbors.
3. Node 2 is not part of any 3-stars as it does not have three neighbors.
4. Node 3 is a part of a 3-star with nodes 6, 9, and 7. <3, (6, 9, 7)>
5. Node 4 is not part of any 3-stars as it does not have three neighbors.
6. Node 5 is not part of any 3-stars as it does not have three neighbors.
7. Node 6 is a part of a 3-star with nodes 3, 9, and 7. <6, (3, 9, 7)>
8. Node 7 is a part of a 3-star with nodes 5, 9, and 6. <7, (5, 9, 6)>
9. Node 8 is not part of any 3-stars as it does not have three neighbors.
10. Node 9 is not part of any 3-stars as it does not have three neighbors.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3]. 
The unique 3-stars are: <3, (6, 9, 7)>, <6, (3, 9, 7)>, <7, (5, 9, 6)>.
