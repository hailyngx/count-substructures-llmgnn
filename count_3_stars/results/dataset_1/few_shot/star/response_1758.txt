Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 3

Response:
The total number of 3-star subgraphs in the given graph is [4].

Unique 3-stars:
<1, (3, 6, 9)>
<3, (1, 2, 6)>
<3, (1, 6, 9)>
<5, (0, 2, 8)>
