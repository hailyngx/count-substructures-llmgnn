Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 5

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are:

<0, (1, 2, 3)>  
<0, (1, 3, 9)>  
<1, (0, 7, 9)>  
<2, (0, 4, 6)>  
<3, (0, 4, 6)>  
<3, (0, 6, 9)>  
<3, (4, 2, 6)>  
<3, (4, 2, 6)>  
<6, (2, 3, 7)>  
<9, (0, 1, 3)>  

Therefore, there are [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
