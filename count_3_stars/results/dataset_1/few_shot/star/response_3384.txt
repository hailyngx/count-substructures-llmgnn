Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 5) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 8

Response:
The nodes that can be the center of a 3-star are nodes 0, 1, 4, 5, 8, and 9 since they have exactly 3 neighbors each. Let's find the number of 3-stars around each potential center node:

- Node 0: There are no 3-stars around node 0 since its neighbors (nodes 3 and 4) are not connected.
- Node 1: There is 1 3-star around node 1: <1, (2, 3, 9)>.
- Node 4: There are no 3-stars around node 4 because its neighbors are not directly connected to each other.
- Node 5: There are 3 3-stars around node 5: <5, (4, 6, 8)>, <5, (4, 7, 8)>, and <5, (6, 7, 8)>.
- Node 8: There is 1 3-star around node 8: <8, (4, 5, 9)>.
- Node 9: There is no 3-star around node 9 since its neighbors (nodes 1 and 2) are not directly connected.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: 
<1, (2, 3, 9)>, 
<5, (4, 6, 8)>, 
<5, (4, 7, 8)>, 
<5, (6, 7, 8)>, 
<8, (4, 5, 9)>.
