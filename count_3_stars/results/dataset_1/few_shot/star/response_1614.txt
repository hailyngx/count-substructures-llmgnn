Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 3) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the 3-stars present. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars present in the graph:

<1, (2, 4, 5)>
<1, (2, 5, 4)>
<1, (4, 5, 2)>
<1, (4, 2, 5)>
<1, (5, 2, 4)>
<1, (5, 4, 2)>
<6, (0, 9, 1)>
<6, (0, 1, 9)>
<6, (1, 9, 0)>
<6, (1, 0, 9)>
<9, (3, 6, 8)>
<9, (3, 8, 6)>
<9, (6, 8, 3)>
<9, (6, 3, 8)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the given graph [14].
