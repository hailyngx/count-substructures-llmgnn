Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 3

Response:
The center node of a 3-star can have at most 3 neighbors. Let's analyze each node:

- Node 0: Connected to 3, 7, 9. Forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 7, 9.
- Node 1: Connected to 2, 3, 5, 6. Forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 3, 5.
- Node 2: Connected to 1, 7, 8. Forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 7, 8.
- Node 3: Connected to 0, 1, 9. Forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, 9.
- Node 4: Connected to 7. Not part of any 3-star.
- Node 5: Connected to 1, 7. Not part of any 3-star.
- Node 6: Connected to 1. Not part of any 3-star.
- Node 7: Connected to 0, 2, 4, 5, 8. Forms multiple 3-stars which are: <0, 7, 9>, <1, 2, 7>, and <3, 7, 9>.
- Node 8: Connected to 2, 7. Not part of any 3-star.
- Node 9: Connected to 0, 3. Forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 3, 9.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, 3, 9>, <1, 2, 7>, <3, 7, 9>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
