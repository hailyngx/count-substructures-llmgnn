Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 8
