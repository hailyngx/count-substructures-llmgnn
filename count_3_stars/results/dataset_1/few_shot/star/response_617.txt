Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 4

Response:
Based on the given information, we can identify the 3-star configurations. Here is the step-by-step process:

1. Identify all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
   - Nodes 0, 1, 3, and 6 have less than three connections.
   - Nodes 5 and 9 have only one connection.
   - Nodes 2, 4, and 8 are connected to exactly three other nodes.

2. For each of the nodes connected to exactly three other nodes (nodes 2, 4, 8), check if they form a 3-star configuration. A 3-star configuration is formed when a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes (leaves).

3. Let's list the unique 3-stars found:
   - <2, (0, 1, 4)>
   - <4, (2, 3, 6)>
   - <8, (2, 3, 7)>

4. Finally, count the total number of 3-stars. 
   - There are 3 unique 3-star configurations identified.

Therefore, the final answer is [3].
