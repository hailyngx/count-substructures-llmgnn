Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 8
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
Let's start by identifying the 3-star structures in the given graph:

- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 5, and 7
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 7, and 8
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 2, and 8
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, and 8
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 5, and 7

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5]. 

<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<1, (0, 7, 8)>
<5, (0, 2, 8)>
<7, (0, 1, 8)>
<8, (1, 5, 7)>
