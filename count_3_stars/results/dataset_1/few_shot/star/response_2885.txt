Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 6) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all unique occurrences where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Here is the information from the given graph formatted for easy analysis:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (0, 4), (1, 6), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 6), (3, 9), (4, 0), (4, 7), (4, 9), (5, 6), (5, 9), (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 5), (6, 7), (6, 9), (7, 4), (7, 6), (9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 6)

Let's identify the 3-stars:

<0, (4, 7, 9)>
<1, (6, 3, 5)>
<2, (3, 6, 9)>
<3, (2, 6, 9)>
<4, (0, 7, 9)>
<5, (6, 9, 3)>
<6, (1, 5, 9)>
<7, (4, 6, 9)>
<9, (3, 4, 5)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
