Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 6, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will first identify all possible 3-stars.

The 3-stars in this graph are:
<0, (2, 6, 4)>
<1, (3, 8, 6)>
<2, (0, 4, 9)>
<3, (1, 4, 5)>
<4, (2, 3, 5)>
<5, (3, 4, 6)>
<6, (0, 5, 9)>
<7, (6, 9, 4)>
<8, (1, 6, 9)>
<9, (4, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
