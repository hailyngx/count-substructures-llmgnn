Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify nodes that are connected to exactly 3 other nodes. These nodes will be the centers of the 3-stars.
2. For each of these central nodes, count how many unique 3-stars can be formed with the connected nodes.
3. Sum up the total count of unique 3-stars.

Let's go through the process step by step:

1. Identify nodes connected to exactly 3 other nodes:
- Node 0, Node 1, Node 6, and Node 7 are connected to exactly 3 other nodes. These will be the central nodes of the 3-stars.

2. Count unique 3-stars for each central node:
- For Node 0: (2, 3, 6), (2, 6, 7) <0, (2, 6, 7)> [2 unique 3-stars]
- For Node 1: (2, 3, 4) <1, (2, 3, 4)> [1 unique 3-star]
- For Node 6: (0, 2, 4), (0, 4, 8), (0, 5, 8), (2, 4, 8) <6, (0, 2, 4)> [4 unique 3-stars]
- For Node 7: (0, 5, 9) <7, (0, 5, 9)> [1 unique 3-star]

3. Sum up the total count of unique 3-stars: [8 unique 3-stars]

Therefore, the final answer is: [8].
