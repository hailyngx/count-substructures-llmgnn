Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 8

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars present. 

Let's start by listing the 3-stars we can find based on the given information. 

Identifying 3-stars:
- Node 0: (5, 2, 0), (2, 5, 0)
- Node 1: (3, 8, 1)
- Node 2: (0, 7, 2), (9, 4, 2), (4, 7, 2), (7, 4, 2)
- Node 5: (0, 8, 5), (8, 0, 5)
- Node 8: (1, 9, 8), (9, 1, 8)

Counting the number of unique 3-stars: 
<0, (5, 2, 0)>, <0, (2, 5, 0)>, <1, (3, 8, 1)>, <2, (0, 7, 2)>, <2, (9, 4, 2)>, <2, (4, 7, 2)>, <2, (7, 4, 2)>, <5, (0, 8, 5)>, <5, (8, 0, 5)>, <8, (1, 9, 8)>, <8, (9, 1, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [11].
