Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 6, and node 7

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
1. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 5, and 6. <1, (2, 5, 6)>
2. Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 5, and 7. <4, (3, 5, 7)>
3. Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 2, and 6. <9, (1, 2, 6)>
4. Node 9 forms another 3-star with nodes 0, 1, and 7. <9, (0, 1, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
