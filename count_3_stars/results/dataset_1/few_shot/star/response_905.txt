Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all occurrences where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars:

1. <1, (2, 7, 8)>
2. <2, (1, 6, 7)>
3. <2, (1, 7, 8)>
4. <2, (6, 7, 9)>
5. <4, (0, 3, 6)>
6. <4, (0, 6, 8)>
7. <6, (0, 2, 3)>
8. <6, (0, 2, 4)>
9. <6, (2, 3, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
