Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 4

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star. 

Let's list each 3-star first:
<0, (1, 9)>  
<1, (0, 7, 9)>  
<3, (4, 6, 8)>  
<4, (3, 7, 8, 9)>  
<7, (1, 2, 4, 6, 8)>  
<8, (3, 4, 5, 7)>  
<9, (0, 1, 4)>  

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars: [7].
