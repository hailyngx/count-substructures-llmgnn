Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 3

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are:
<0, (2, 5, 9)>
<1, (3, 6, 9)>
<2, (0, 6, 7)>
<6, (1, 2, 4)>
<6, (1, 5, 8)>
<8, (5, 6, 0)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
