Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 5, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a star pattern. Let's go step by step:

We will list all possible 3-stars, each in the format <center, (leaf1, leaf2, leaf3)>. Once we list them all out, we will count the total number of unique 3-stars.

Here are the 3-stars in the given graph:
<0, (2, 7, 8)>
<1, (5, 8, 9)>
<2, (0, 8, 9)>
<4, (5, 9, 4)>
<5, (1, 4, 6)>
<8, (0, 1, 2)>
<9, (1, 4, 8)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars:
