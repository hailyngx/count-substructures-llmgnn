Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star in the graph. A 3-star consists of a central node that is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's go through the graph and identify the 3-stars step by step:

1. Node 0: Not part of any 3-star since it is connected to only 2 nodes (2 and 3).
2. Node 1: Not part of any 3-star since it is connected to more than 3 nodes (3, 6, and 9).
3. Node 2: Forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 5, and 7.
4. Node 3: Not part of any 3-star since it is connected to more than 3 nodes (0, 1, and 7).
5. Node 4: Forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 5, and 9.
6. Node 5: Forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 4, and 8.
7. Node 6: Not part of any 3-star since it is connected to only 2 nodes (1 and 2).
8. Node 7: Not part of any 3-star since it is connected to only 2 nodes (2 and 3).
9. Node 8: Not part of any 3-star since it is connected to only 2 nodes (5 and 9).
10. Node 9: Not part of any 3-star since it is connected to more than 3 nodes (1, 4, and 8).

Therefore, the 3-stars in the given graph are <2, (4, 5, 7)>, <4, (2, 5, 9)>, <5, (2, 4, 8)>.

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
