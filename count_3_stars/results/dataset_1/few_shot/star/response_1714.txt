Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 1
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in the graph.

Based on the provided edge list and adjacency list, the 3-stars in the graph are as follows:
<2, (4, 5, 9)>
<4, (2, 5, 9)>
<5, (2, 4, 9)>
<6, (2, 5, 9)>
