Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 8

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph. 

The nodes with exactly 3 neighbors are:
- Node 4 (neighbors: 1, 2, 6)
- Node 8 (neighbors: 4, 7, 9)

Now let's count the number of 3-stars and list them:

Number of 3-stars: [2]
<4, (1, 2, 6)>
<8, (4, 7, 9)>
