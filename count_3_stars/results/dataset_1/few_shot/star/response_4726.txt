Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that has exactly three neighbors (connected nodes). Since a 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes, we will identify these structures in the graph.

Based on the information provided, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:
1. <1, (2, 5, 7)>
2. <2, (1, 5, 8)>
3. <7, (1, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
