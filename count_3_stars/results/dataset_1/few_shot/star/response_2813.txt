Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Looking at the adjacency list for each node and the definition of a 3-star graph, we can identify the following unique 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (4, 6, 8)>
<0, (4, 8, 9)>
<0, (6, 8, 9)>
<2, (1, 3, 8)>
<4, (0, 3, 9)>
<8, (0, 2, 7)>
<7, (3, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
