Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 4, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. Since a 3-star has a central node and three leaves, we need to find nodes that have exactly 3 neighbors. Let's list the nodes with 3 neighbors:

- Node 0: (4, 5, 8)
- Node 2: (5, 6, 9)
- Node 3: (4, 5, 8)

From the listed nodes above, we can represent the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (4, 5, 8)>
<2, (5, 6, 9)>
<3, (4, 5, 8)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
