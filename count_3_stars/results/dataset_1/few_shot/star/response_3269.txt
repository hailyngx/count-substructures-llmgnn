Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 4

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph. 

Node 0: <0, (2, 3, 7)>
Node 1: <1, (2, 5, 7)>
Node 2: <2, (0, 1, 4)>
Node 4: <4, (2, 6, 9)>
Node 7: <7, (0, 1, 6)>

Now, let's count the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph.
