Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 2) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 2
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 5

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 2 forms a 3-star: <2, (0, 5, 7)>
2. Node 5 forms a 3-star: <5, (2, 9, 9)>
3. Node 9 forms a 3-star: <9, (1, 4, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
