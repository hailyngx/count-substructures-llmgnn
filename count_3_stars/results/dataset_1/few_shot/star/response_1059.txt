Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can identify each possible 3-star by checking each node in the graph as a potential center node and then looking at its neighbors to determine if a 3-star exists. 

Here are the steps we can follow to count the number of 3-stars:

1. Identify potential center nodes in the graph.
   - Nodes with exactly 3 neighbors can be potential center nodes.

2. For each potential center node, check if it forms a 3-star configuration with its neighbors.

Now let's go ahead and count the number of 3-stars in the given graph. 

The graph has the following potential center nodes:
- Potential center nodes: 1, 3, 5, 6, 8

Now, we will check each potential center node to see if a 3-star configuration exists:

- For potential center node 1, the 3-star configurations are: 
  <1, (0, 5, 6)>
  <1, (3, 5, 6)>
  [2]
 
- For potential center node 3, the 3-star configurations are: 
  <3, (1, 8, 9)>
  [1]

- For potential center node 5, the 3-star configurations are: 
  <5, (1, 8, 9)>
  [1]

- For potential center node 6, the 3-star configurations are: 
  <6, (1, 8, 9)>
  [1]

- For potential center node 8, the 3-star configurations are: 
  <8, (3, 5, 6)>
  [1]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6]. 
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<1, (0, 5, 6)>, <1, (3, 5, 6)>, <3, (1, 8, 9)>, <5, (1, 8, 9)>, <6, (1, 8, 9)>, <8, (3, 5, 6)>
