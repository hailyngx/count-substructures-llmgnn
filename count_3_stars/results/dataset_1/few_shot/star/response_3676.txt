Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 4, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to understand that a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

- 3-star with center at node 0: <0, (1, 2, 3)>
- 3-star with center at node 1: <1, (0, 2, 6)>
- 3-star with center at node 2: <2, (0, 1, 3)>
- 3-star with center at node 3: <3, (0, 2, 6)>
- 3-star with center at node 8: <8, (1, 3, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
