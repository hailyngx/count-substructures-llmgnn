Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all possible 3-stars based on the definition provided. 

Since a 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes, we will look for nodes in the graph that have exactly three neighbors. These nodes have the potential to be the center of a 3-star.

In this graph, the nodes with exactly three neighbors are nodes 0, 1, and 4. Let's list the 3-stars that can be formed with these nodes:

<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<0, (1, 8, 5)>
<1, (0, 7, 8)>
<1, (0, 8, 9)>
<4, (2, 5, 7)>
<4, (5, 0, 7)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars, we have found a total of [7] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
