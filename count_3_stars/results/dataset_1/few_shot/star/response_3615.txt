Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node and its connected leaves for each 3-star. 

Let's analyze the given graph:

- Node 0 is not part of any 3-star because it has only one connection.
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 6, and 7.
- Node 2 is not part of any 3-star because it has only two connections.
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 7, and 9.
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, and 9.
- Node 5 is not part of any 3-star because it has only two connections.
- Node 6 is not part of any 3-star because it has only two connections.
- Node 7 is not part of any 3-star because it has only two connections.
- Node 8 is not part of any 3-star because it has only two connections.
- Node 9 is not part of any 3-star because it has only two connections.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].


Unique 3-stars:
<1, (4, 6, 7)>
<3, (4, 7, 9)>
