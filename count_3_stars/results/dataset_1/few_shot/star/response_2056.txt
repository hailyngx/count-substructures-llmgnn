Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a 3-star pattern.

Looking at the adjacency list, we can identify the 3-stars as follows:
- <0, (2, 4, 7)>
- <0, (2, 7, 9)>
- <0, (4, 7, 9)>
- <1, (4, 6, 7)>
- <1, (4, 7, 8)>
- <1, (6, 7, 9)>
- <1, (7, 6, 8)>
- <2, (0, 5, 7)>
- <2, (0, 7, 8)>
- <2, (5, 4, 8)>
- <2, (7, 6, 8)>
- <4, (0, 5, 9)>
- <4, (1, 5, 8)>
- <4, (5, 0, 6)>
- <4, (5, 6, 9)>
- <5, (2, 4, 8)>
- <6, (1, 4, 9)>
- <6, (4, 0, 7)>
- <6, (4, 7, 9)>
- <6, (7, 0, 9)>
- <7, (0, 2, 8)>
- <7, (1, 2, 8)>
- <8, (1, 2, 9)>
- <8, (2, 0, 5)>
- <8, (2, 5, 4)>
- <8, (5, 4, 9)>

Count of 3-stars: [25]
