Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 2

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star pattern.

Looking at the graph's adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (5, 9)>
<1, (3, 6, 8)>
<8, (1, 5, 6)>
<9, (0, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
