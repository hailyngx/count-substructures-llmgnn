Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 5) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 9
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 7

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph. 

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<3, (0, 7, 9)>
<5, (1, 2, 4)>
<7, (3, 4, 9)>
<9, (3, 7, 9)>
