Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 2

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in the graph. Let's identify the 3-stars step by step.

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 8, and 9:
   - <0, (5, 6, 8)>
   - <0, (5, 6, 9)>
   - <0, (5, 8, 9)>
   - <0, (6, 8, 9)>
   [4]

2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 7, 8, and 9:
   - <1, (3, 5, 7)>
   - <1, (3, 5, 8)>
   - <1, (3, 5, 9)>
   - <1, (3, 7, 8)>
   - <1, (3, 7, 9)>
   - <1, (3, 8, 9)>
   - <1, (5, 7, 8)>
   - <1, (5, 7, 9)>
   - <1, (5, 8, 9)>
   - <1, (7, 8, 9)>
   [10]

3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 4 and 9:
   - <2, (4, 9)>
   [1]

4. Node 4 is connected to nodes 2 and 6:
   - <4, (2, 6)>
   [1]

5. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0 and 1:
   - <5, (0, 1)>
   [1]

6. Node 6 is connected to nodes 0 and 4:
   - <6, (0, 4)>
   [1]

7. Node 7 is connected to nodes 1 and 8:
   - <7, (1, 8)>
   [1]

8. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 7:
   - <8, (0, 1, 7)>
   [1]

9. Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 2:
   - <9, (0, 1, 2)>
   [1]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
