Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a 3-star pattern.

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<2, (6, 8, 9)>
<3, (0, 4, 5)>
<4, (0, 3, 7)>
<5, (0, 3, 6)>
<8, (2, 5, 9)>
<9, (2, 5, 8)>

Count of 3-stars in the graph: [7]
