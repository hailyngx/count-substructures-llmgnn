Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 9
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify sets of nodes that form 3-stars. 

Let's list out all the 3-stars by looking at each node as a potential center node and identifying its adjacent nodes:

1. For node 1:
   <1, (2, 4, 6)> (1 is the center, connected to nodes 2, 4, and 6)

2. For node 2:
   <2, (1, 4, 6)> (2 is the center, connected to nodes 1, 4, and 6)

3. For node 4:
   <4, (1, 2, 5)> (4 is the center, connected to nodes 1, 2, and 5)

4. For node 5:
   <5, (0, 4, 6)> (5 is the center, connected to nodes 0, 4, and 6)

5. For node 6:
   <6, (1, 2, 5)> (6 is the center, connected to nodes 1, 2, and 5)

6. For node 9:
   <9, (1, 2, 7)> (9 is the center, connected to nodes 1, 2, and 7)

Counting the unique 3-stars found:
