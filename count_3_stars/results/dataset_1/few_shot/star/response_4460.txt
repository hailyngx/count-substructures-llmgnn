Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 4
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. From the adjacency list, we can see that each of the nodes in the graph is connected to at least one other node, except nodes 6, 8, and 9. Since a 3-star must have a central node and three leaves, nodes 6, 8, and 9 cannot be part of any 3-star.

2. For each node that is connected to at least one other node, we will check if it forms a 3-star by having exactly 3 edges. If so, we will list the 3-star configuration.

3. We will list the unique 3-stars found.

Let's start:

From the edges given, we find the following 3-stars:

<0, (5, 7, 7)>
<1, (3, 3, 1)>
<2, (4, 4, 7)>
<4, (2, 7, 7)>
<7, (0, 2, 4)>
