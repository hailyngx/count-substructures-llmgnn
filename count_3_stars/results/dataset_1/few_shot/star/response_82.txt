Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 7

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
1. Node 0 forms a 3-star: <0, (4, 5, 2)>
2. Node 3 forms a 3-star: <3, (5, 9, 6)>
3. Node 4 forms a 3-star: <4, (0, 5, 2)>
4. Node 6 forms a 3-star: <6, (7, 9, 3)>
5. Node 7 forms a 3-star: <7, (6, 9, 3)>
6. Node 9 forms a 3-star: <9, (3, 6, 7)>

So, there are a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
