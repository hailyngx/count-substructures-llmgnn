Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 3) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the unique 3-stars present. 

Here are the unique 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (5, 9)>
<1, (3, 4, 8)>
<2, (7)>
<3, (1, 4, 5)>
<4, (1, 3, 8)>
<5, (0, 3)>
<6, (3)>
<7, (2)>
<8, (1, 4)>
<9, (0, 3, 4)>

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars: [10].
