Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 2

Response:
First, let's list all the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (6, 7, 9)>
<2, (6, 0, 9)>
<9, (0, 2, 6)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars in the graph, we find that there are [3] 3-stars.
