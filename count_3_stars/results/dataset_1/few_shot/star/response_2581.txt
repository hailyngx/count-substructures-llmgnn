Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 6) (3, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 9
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star configuration. Let's go step by step to find all the 3-stars:

1. Node 0:
   - Node 0 is not part of any 3-star configuration as it is only connected to one node.

2. Node 1:
   - Node 1 is not part of any 3-star configuration as it is only connected to one node.

3. Node 2:
   - Node 2 is not part of any 3-star configuration as it is only connected to one node.

4. Node 3:
   - Node 3 is not part of any 3-star configuration as it is only connected to one node.

5. Node 4:
   - Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes, so it cannot form a 3-star.

6. Node 5:
   - Node 5 forms a 3-star: <5, (1, 6, 8)>

7. Node 6:
   - Node 6 forms two 3-stars: <6, (2, 5, 7)> and <6, (6, 7, 9)>

8. Node 7:
   - Node 7 is not part of any 3-star configuration as it is only connected to two nodes.

9. Node 8:
   - Node 8 is not part of any 3-star configuration as it is only connected to two nodes.

10. Node 9:
   - Node 9 forms two 3-stars: <9, (0, 6, 8)> and <9, (3, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: <5, (1, 6, 8)>, <6, (2, 5, 7)>, <6, (6, 7, 9)>, <9, (0, 6, 8)>.
