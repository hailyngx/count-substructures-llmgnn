Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to understand that a 3-star is formed by a central node connected to exactly three leaf nodes. 

Next, we can identify all the 3-stars by looking at each node and checking if it is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars in the graph using the format <central node, (leaf node 1, leaf node 2, leaf node 3)>:

<0, (1, 4, 8)>
<1, (0, 4, 7)>
<2, (5, 6, 8)>
<4, (0, 1, 6)>
<7, (1, 3, 9)>
<9, (2, 5, 7)>

Count for the number of 3-stars in the graph is: [6].
