Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a 3-star configuration.

Based on the given information, the 3-stars in this graph are:
<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<1, (0, 6, 7)>
<3, (0, 4, 6)>
<4, (0, 3, 9)>
<6, (1, 3, 7)>
<8, (1, 2, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
