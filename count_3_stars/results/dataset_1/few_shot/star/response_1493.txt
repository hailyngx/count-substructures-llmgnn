Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, and node 8

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all occurrences where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's go through each node to identify the 3-stars:

- Node 0: Not a 3-star (has 4 connections)
- Node 1: Not a 3-star (has 4 connections)
- Node 2: Not a 3-star (has 4 connections)
- Node 3: <3, (1, 2, 6)>
- Node 4: Not a 3-star (has 3 connections)
- Node 5: Not a 3-star (has 1 connection)
- Node 6: <6, (0, 3, 4)>
- Node 7: Not a 3-star (has 3 connections)
- Node 8: Not a 3-star (has 2 connections)
- Node 9: Not a 3-star (has 6 connections)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2]. 
The unique 3-stars found are <3, (1, 2, 6)> and <6, (0, 3, 4)>.
