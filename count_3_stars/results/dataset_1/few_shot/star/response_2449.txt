Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's list the 3-stars present in the graph:

<0, (1, 9, 9)>
<1, (0, 5, 5)>
<2, (4, 5, 5)>
<3, (1, 6, 6)>
<4, (2, 7, 7)>
<5, (1, 2, 6)>
<6, (3, 5, 8)>
<6, (5, 8, 9)>
<6, (9, 8, 9)>
<8, (6, 9, 6)>
<9, (0, 6, 9)>
<9, (6, 8, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
