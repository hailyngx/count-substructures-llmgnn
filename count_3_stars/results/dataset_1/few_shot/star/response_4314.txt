Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to understand that a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Looking at the given edges and adjacency list, it seems that there are a few 3-stars in this graph:

1. (2, 5, 9, 6) - Node 2 is the central node, and it is connected to nodes 5, 9, and 6.
2. (3, 7, 8, 9) - Node 3 is the central node, and it is connected to nodes 7, 8, and 9.
3. (5, 2, 9, 6) - Node 5 is the central node, and it is connected to nodes 2, 9, and 6.
4. (6, 2, 9, 5) - Node 6 is the central node, and it is connected to nodes 2, 9, and 5.
5. (8, 0, 2, 3) - Node 8 is the central node, and it is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 3.
6. (9, 1, 3, 6) - Node 9 is the central node, and it is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 6.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [6].

<1, (2, 5, 9, 6)> <2, (3, 7, 8, 9)> <3, (5, 2, 9, 6)> <4, (6, 2, 9, 5)> <5, (8, 0, 2, 3)> <6, (9, 1, 3, 6)>
