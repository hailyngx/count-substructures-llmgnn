Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars present. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Observations:
1. The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9.
2. From the adjacency list, we can determine the connections for each node.

Now, let's identify all the 3-stars:

<1, (0, 6, 9)>
<1, (5, 7, 9)>
<4, (3, 6, 9)>
<7, (1, 5, 9)>

Count of 3-stars: [4]
