Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 7

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are:
<1, (5, 6, 9)>
<3, (0, 6, 8)>
<5, (1, 7, 9)>
<6, (1, 3, 8)>
<7, (4, 5, 9)>
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
