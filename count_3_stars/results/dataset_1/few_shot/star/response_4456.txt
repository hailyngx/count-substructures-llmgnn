Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 5

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Looking at the adjacency information provided, we can determine the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 0 forms a 3-star with (4, 9)
2. Node 2 forms a 3-star with (4, 6, 7)
3. Node 4 forms a 3-star with (0, 2, 5)
4. Node 7 forms a 3-star with (2, 4, 6)
5. Node 8 forms a 3-star with (3, 5, 7)
6. Node 9 forms a 3-star with (0, 1, 5)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

Unique 3-stars: 
<0, (4, 9)>
<2, (4, 6, 7)>
<4, (0, 2, 5)>
<7, (2, 4, 6)>
<8, (3, 5, 7)>
<9, (0, 1, 5)>
