Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify each 3-star by finding the central node and its three connected nodes. 

Given the adjacency list and edge information, we can determine the 3-stars in the graph:

1. For Node 0:
   - <0, (1, 4, 5)>
   - <0, (1, 7, 9)>

2. For Node 1:
   - No 3-stars centered at Node 1.

3. For Node 2:
   - No 3-stars centered at Node 2.

4. For Node 3:
   - No 3-stars centered at Node 3.

5. For Node 4:
   - <4, (0, 5, 8)>

6. For Node 5:
   - No 3-stars centered at Node 5.

7. For Node 6:
   - No 3-stars centered at Node 6.

8. For Node 7:
   - No 3-stars centered at Node 7.

9. For Node 8:
   - No 3-stars centered at Node 8.

10. For Node 9:
   - No 3-stars centered at Node 9.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2]. 
The unique 3-stars are: <0, (1, 4, 5)>, <0, (1, 7, 9)>.
