Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's identify the 3-stars one by one:

<0, (2, 4, 8)>
<2, (0, 1, 6)>
<4, (0, 8, -)>
<5, (3, 9, -)>
<6, (2, 8, -)>
<8, (4, 6, 7)>
<9, (5, -, -)>

So, there are a total of [7] 3-stars in the given graph.
