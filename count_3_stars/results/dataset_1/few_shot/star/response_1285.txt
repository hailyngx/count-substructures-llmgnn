Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 8

Response:
We are looking for 3-star subgraphs in this graph. Let's go through each node to check if it is the center of a 3-star.

Node 0:
- Node 0 is not the center of a 3-star.

Node 1:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2 and 8.
- <1, (2, 8, -)> is a 3-star with node 1 as the center.

Node 2:
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1 and 5.
- <2, (1, 5, -)> is a 3-star with node 2 as the center.

Node 3:
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 6 and 9.
- <3, (6, 9, -)> is a 3-star with node 3 as the center.

Node 4:
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 9.
- <4, (5, 6, 9)> is a 3-star with node 4 as the center.

Node 5:
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, and 7.
- <5, (0, 2, 7)> is a 3-star with node 5 as the center.

Node 6:
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 8.
- <6, (3, 4, 8)> is a 3-star with node 6 as the center.

Node 7:
- Node 7 is not the center of a 3-star.

Node 8:
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 6, and 9.
- <8, (1, 6, 9)> is a 3-star with node 8 as the center.

Node 9:
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 8.
- <9, (3, 4, 8)> is a 3-star with node 9 as the center.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7]. 
The unique 3-stars are: <1, (2, 8, -)>, <2, (1, 5, -)>, <3, (6, 9, -)>, <4, (5, 6, 9)>, <5, (0, 2, 7)>, <6, (3, 4, 8)>, <8, (1, 6, 9)>.
