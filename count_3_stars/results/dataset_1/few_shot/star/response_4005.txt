Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern.

Looking at the adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-star patterns:

<2, (3, 6, 8)>
<3, (2, 5, 7)>
<4, (7, 8, 9)>
<6, (2, 8, 9)>
<7, (0, 3, 4)>
<8, (2, 4, 6)>
<9, (3, 4, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
