Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 3

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the graph. Central nodes are the nodes with exactly 3 edges connected to them. The central nodes in this graph are: 0, 2, 3, and 8.

Next, let's find 3-stars in the graph. 

For node 0, the 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 7, 8)>
<0, (6, 7, 8)>

For node 2, the 3-stars are:
<2, (0, 3, 8)>
<2, (0, 8, 9)>

For node 3, the 3-stars are:
<3, (2, 5, 8)>
<3, (2, 7, 8)>
<3, (7, 8, 9)>

For node 8, the 3-stars are:
<8, (0, 2, 3)>
<8, (0, 3, 5)>
<8, (0, 3, 8)>
<8, (0, 5, 8)>
<8, (2, 3, 4)>
<8, (2, 3, 5)>
<8, (2, 4, 8)>
<8, (2, 5, 8)>
<8, (3, 5, 8)>

Counting the unique 3-stars gives us a total of 9 3-stars.
