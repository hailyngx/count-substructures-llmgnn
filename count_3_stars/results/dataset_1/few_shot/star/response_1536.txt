Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 1

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (1, 6, -)>
<1, (0, 2, 4)>
<1, (0, 4, 5)>
<1, (0, 5, 8)>
<1, (0, 8, 9)>
<2, (1, 4, 5)>
<2, (1, 5, 8)>
<4, (1, 2, 5)>
<4, (1, 5, 6)>
<4, (1, 6, 7)>
<5, (1, 2, 8)>
<5, (1, 4, 6)>
<5, (1, 6, 8)>
<8, (1, 2, 5)>
