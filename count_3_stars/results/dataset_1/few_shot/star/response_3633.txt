Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 3

Response:
To count the number of 3-star subgraphs in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through the nodes and determine the 3-stars:

1. Start with each node and check if it is connected to exactly three other nodes:
   
   - Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9. Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 5, and 6: <0, (1, 5, 6)>.
   - Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 5. Node 1 does not form a 3-star.
   - Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 5. Node 2 does not form a 3-star.
   - Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 6, 8, and 9. Node 3 does not form a 3-star.
   - Node 4 is connected to nodes 0 and 3. Node 4 does not form a 3-star.
   - Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 2. Node 5 does not form a 3-star.
   - Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 8. Node 6 does not form a 3-star.
   - Node 7 is connected to nodes 0 and 8. Node 7 does not form a 3-star.
   - Node 8 is connected to nodes 3, 6, and 7. Node 8 does not form a 3-star.
   - Node 9 is connected to nodes 0 and 3. Node 9 does not form a 3-star.

Count of 3-stars in the graph: [1]

Therefore, the unique 3-star found is <0, (1, 5, 6)>.
