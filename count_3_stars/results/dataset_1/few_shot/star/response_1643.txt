Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern. 

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
<2, (3, 7, 9)>
<3, (2, 4, 7)>
<4, (3)>
<5, (6, 7)>
<6, (5, 9)>
<7, (2, 5, 9)>
<9, (2, 6, 7)>

Count of 3-stars: [7]
