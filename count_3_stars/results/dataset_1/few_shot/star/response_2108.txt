Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 2
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

From the adjacency list provided, we can see that there are potential 3-stars centered at nodes 0, 1, 2, and 7. We will check each of these nodes to see if they form 3-stars.

1. For node 0:
   - <0, (1, 2, 3)>
   - <0, (1, 7, 3)>
   [2 unique 3-stars for node 0]

2. For node 1:
   - <1, (0, 2, 4)>
   - <1, (0, 7, 3)>
   [2 unique 3-stars for node 1]

3. For node 2:
   - <2, (0, 1, 3)>
   [1 unique 3-star for node 2]

4. For node 7:
   - <7, (0, 1, 3)>
   [1 unique 3-star for node 7]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2 + 2 + 1 + 1] = [6].
