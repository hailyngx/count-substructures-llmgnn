Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 4

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

1. Node 0: <0, (2, 6, 7)>, <0, (2, 6, 8)>, <0, (2, 7, 8)>, <0, (6, 7, 8)>
2. Node 1: No 3-stars with node 1 as the center
3. Node 2: No 3-stars with node 2 as the center
4. Node 3: No 3-stars with node 3 as the center
5. Node 4: <4, (1, 5, 7)>, <4, (1, 5, 9)>, <4, (1, 7, 9)>, <4, (5, 7, 9)>
6. Node 5: No 3-stars with node 5 as the center
7. Node 6: No 3-stars with node 6 as the center
8. Node 7: No 3-stars with node 7 as the center
9. Node 8: No 3-stars with node 8 as the center
10. Node 9: No 3-stars with node 9 as the center

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
