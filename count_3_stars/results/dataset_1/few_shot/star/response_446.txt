Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 8
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars in the graph based on the definition provided.

A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. So, we need to find nodes in the graph that satisfy this condition.

Looking at the adjacency list:
- Node 1, 2, 4, and 8 are potential central nodes as they have 3 edges each.
- For each potential central node, we check if it forms a 3-star:

1. Based on the given edges, the 3-stars in the graph are:
   - <1, (4, 7, 9)>
   - <2, (0, 4, 8)>
   - <4, (1, 2, 8)>
   - <8, (2, 4, 7)>

Counting the number of 3-stars, we find that there are [4] 3-stars in the given graph. 

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
