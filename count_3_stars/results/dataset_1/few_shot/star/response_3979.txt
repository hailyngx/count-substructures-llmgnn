Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes, which will form a 3-star pattern with that node as the center. 

Here are the 3-stars found in the graph:
<[0, (3, 5, 6)]>
<[2, (4, 6, 7)]>
<[3, (0, 4, 5)]>
<[5, (0, 4, 9)]>
<[6, (0, 2, 8)]>
<[7, (1, 5, 8)]>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
