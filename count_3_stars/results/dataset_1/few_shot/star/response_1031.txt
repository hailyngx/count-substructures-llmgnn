Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify the 3-star structures in the graph.

A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list the 3-stars in the graph:

<1, (2, 6, 8)>
<2, (1, 3, 6)>
<3, (2, 7, 8)>
<6, (0, 1, 2)>
<9, (1, 3, 5)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars yields [5].
