Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5

Response:
Let's find the 3-star graphs in the given graph. 

1. Node 2 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 9. This forms a 3-star: <2, (5, 6, 9)>.
2. Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 8, and 9. This forms a 3-star: <5, (2, 8, 9)>.
3. Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 7. This forms a 3-star: <6, (2, 4, 7)>.

Therefore, there are [3] 3-star graphs in the given graph.
