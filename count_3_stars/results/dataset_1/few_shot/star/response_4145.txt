Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, and node 7

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Looking at the adjacency lists, we can see that the following nodes are connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 1: (3, 5, 8)
- Node 2: (3, 5, 7)
- Node 4: (3, 5, 7)
- Node 5: (1, 2, 4)
- Node 7: (0, 2, 9)
- Node 8: (1, 4, 7)
- Node 9: (5, 7)

Let's count the number of unique 3-stars:
<1, (3, 5, 8)>
<2, (3, 5, 7)>
<4, (3, 5, 7)>
<5, (1, 2, 4)>
<7, (0, 2, 9)>
<8, (1, 4, 7)>
<9, (5, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
