Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 3

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in the form of a 3-star pattern. 

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<1, (3, 5, 9)>
<2, (3, 4, 5)>
<3, (1, 2, 6)>
<5, (1, 2, 6)>
<7, (5, 8, -)>
<9, (1, 3, -)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
