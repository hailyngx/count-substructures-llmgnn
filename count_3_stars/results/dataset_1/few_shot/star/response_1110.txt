Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in the pattern of a 3-star graph.

Given the adjacency list and the definition of a 3-star graph, we can identify the following 3-stars:

<1, (0, 5, 8)>
<5, (1, 6, 8)>
<7, (3, 6, 9)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
