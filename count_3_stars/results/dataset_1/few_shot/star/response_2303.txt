Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 4

Response:
Following the definition of a 3-star graph, we are looking for nodes that are connected to exactly 3 other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

<0, (1, 4, 9)>
<1, (0, 8, -)>
<4, (0, 3, 9)>
<3, (4, 5, 6)>
<5, (3, 6, -)>
<6, (3, 5, -)>
<7, (3, 8, -)>
<8, (1, 3, 7)>
<9, (0, 4, -)>

There are a total of [9] 3-star structures in the given graph.
