Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 8

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each occurrence of a central node connected to exactly three leaf nodes.

Given the graph and its adjacency list, we can start by looking at each node and its neighbors to identify the 3-stars.

Let's list the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<1, (3, 4, 5)>
<2, (0, 7, 9)>
<4, (1, 7, 9)>
<9, (2, 4, 8)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars found in the graph and provide the answer inside brackets:

[4]
