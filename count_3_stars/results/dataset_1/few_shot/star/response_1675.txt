Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 4, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, and node 7

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step by step:

1. **Identify Nodes with 3 Connections:**
   From the adjacency list provided:
   - Node 0, Node 1, Node 4, and Node 6 are all connected to exactly 3 other nodes.
   
2. **List the 3-Stars:**
   - <0, (1, 7, 8)>
   - <1, (0, 2, 3)>
   - <1, (0, 4, 6)>
   - <4, (1, 2, 3)>
   - <4, (1, 6, 6)>
   - <6, (0, 1, 8)>

3. **Count the Total Number of 3-Stars:**
   There are a total of [6] 3-stars in this graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [6].
