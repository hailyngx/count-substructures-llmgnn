Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 9
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. This forms the definition of a 3-star graph.

Looking at the given graph and its adjacency list, we can find the following 3-stars:

<0, (2, 5, 6)>
<1, (3, 5, 6)>
<5, (0, 1, 6)>
<6, (0, 1, 5)>
<8, (5, 6, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
