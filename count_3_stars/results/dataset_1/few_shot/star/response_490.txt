Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all possible 3-stars. In a 3-star, the center node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a star-like structure.

Looking at the adjacency list and edges provided, we can see that there are three possible 3-stars in this graph:
1. Center node: 2, Leaves: 3, 4, 6
2. Center node: 4, Leaves: 2, 5, 8
3. Center node: 6, Leaves: 0, 9, 7

Thus, we have identified all the 3-stars in the given graph. Now, we can calculate the final count of 3-stars:
