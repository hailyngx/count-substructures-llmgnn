Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 2

Response:
There are 3-stars centered at nodes 0, 1, 3, 5, and 6 in the given graph.
Hence, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].

Let's list the unique 3-stars:
<0, (5, 6, 8)>
<1, (2, 3, 6)>
<3, (1, 6, 7)>
<5, (0, 7, 8)>
<6, (0, 1, 3)>
