Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 4, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each possible 3-star. A 3-star in a graph consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (7, 8, 0)>
<1, (5, 7, 1)>
<2, (5, 8, 2)>
<3, (4, 5, 8)>
<4, (3, 5, 4)>
<5, (1, 2, 5)>
<6, (5, 9, 6)>
<7, (0, 1, 7)>
<8, (0, 2, 8)>
<9, (4, 6, 9)>

Since there are 10 unique 3-stars listed above, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
