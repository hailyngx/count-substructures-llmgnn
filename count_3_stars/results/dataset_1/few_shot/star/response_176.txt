Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star pattern.

From the adjacency list provided, we can see that the nodes that have exactly three connections (forming a 3-star) are:
- Node 0: connected to nodes 2, 3, 5
- Node 1: connected to nodes 2, 3, 8
- Node 2: connected to nodes 0, 1, 4
- Node 3: connected to nodes 0, 1, 6
- Node 6: connected to nodes 1, 3, 9
- Node 8: connected to nodes 1, 3, 5

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (2, 3, 5)>
<1, (2, 3, 8)>
<2, (0, 1, 4)>
<3, (0, 1, 6)>
<6, (1, 3, 9)>
<8, (1, 3, 5)>
