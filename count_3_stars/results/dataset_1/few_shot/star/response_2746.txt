Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 3

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that can act as the central node in a 3-star. The central node must have exactly three edges connected to it. In this case, only nodes 0, 2, and 3 meet this criterion.

Next, we will look at each of these central nodes and identify the 3-stars centered at them:

1. For node 0:
    - <0, (2, 3, 4)>
    - <0, (2, 3, 5)>
    - <0, (2, 3, 7)>
    - <0, (3, 2, 5)>
    - <0, (3, 2, 7)>
    - <0, (4, 0, 6)>
    - <0, (5, 0, 6)>
    [7 unique 3-stars]

2. For node 2:
    - <2, (0, 3, 5)>
    - <2, (0, 3, 7)>
    [2 unique 3-stars]

3. For node 3:
    - <3, (0, 2, 8)>
    [1 unique 3-star]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
