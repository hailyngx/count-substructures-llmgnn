Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node has exactly three neighbors, creating a 3-star pattern with that node as the center. 

In the given graph, the nodes along with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: (3, 7, 8)
- Node 1: (5, 7, 8)
- Node 2: (3, 4, 6)
- Node 3: (0, 2, 4, 5, 9)
- Node 4: (2, 3, 7)
- Node 5: (1, 3, 6)
- Node 6: (2, 5, 7)
- Node 7: (0, 1, 4, 6)
- Node 8: (0, 1, 9)
- Node 9: (3, 8)

Let's identify the 3-star patterns:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with (3, 7, 8)
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with (5, 7, 8)
- Node 2 does not form a 3-star as it has more or less than three neighbors.
- Node 3 does not form a 3-star as it has more than three neighbors.
- Node 4 does not form a 3-star as it has more or less than three neighbors.
- Node 5 does not form a 3-star as it has more or less than three neighbors.
- Node 6 does not form a 3-star as it has more or less than three neighbors.
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with (0, 4, 6)
- Node 8 does not form a 3-star as it has more or less than three neighbors.
- Node 9 does not form a 3-star as it has more or less than three neighbors.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].

<0, (3, 7, 8)>, <1, (5, 7, 8)>
