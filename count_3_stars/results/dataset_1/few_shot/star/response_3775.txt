Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 8

Response:
Let's first identify the 3-stars by checking each node if they are the central node of a 3-star and count them. Once we identify all 3-stars, we will count them to get the final answer.

- Node 0: <0, (1, 4, 6)> is a 3-star.
- Node 1: <1, (0, 2, 3)> is a 3-star.
- Node 2: <2, (1, 6, 7)> is a 3-star.
- Node 3: <3, (0, 5, 9)> is a 3-star.
- Node 4: <4, (0, 8, 9)> is a 3-star.
- Node 5: No 3-star as it has only 2 connections.
- Node 6: <6, (0, 2, 7)> is a 3-star.
- Node 7: <7, (1, 2, 6)> is a 3-star.
- Node 8: <8, (0, 4, 9)> is a 3-star.
- Node 9: <9, (0, 3, 4)> is a 3-star.

Count of 3-stars: 5
Therefore, the final answer is [5].
