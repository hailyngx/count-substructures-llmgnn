Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 4
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes and their adjacent nodes. The central nodes in a 3-star graph will be those with exactly 3 adjacent nodes.

Central nodes:
- Node 0 (Connected to nodes 1, 2, 4)
- Node 4 (Connected to nodes 0, 2, 7)

Now, let's determine the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<0, (1, 4, 2)>
<0, (2, 1, 4)>
<0, (2, 4, 1)>
<0, (4, 1, 2)>
<0, (4, 2, 1)>

<4, (0, 2, 7)>
<4, (0, 7, 2)>
<4, (2, 0, 7)>
<4, (2, 7, 0)>
<4, (7, 0, 2)>
<4, (7, 2, 0)>

Therefore, there are [12] 3-stars in this graph.
