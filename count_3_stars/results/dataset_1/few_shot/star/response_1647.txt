Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 46 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Looking at the adjacency list for each node, we can identify the following unique 3-stars:

<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<0, (6, 7, 8)>
<0, (7, 8, 9)>
<2, (0, 4, 7)>
<2, (4, 8, 9)>
<3, (0, 6, 9)>
<4, (2, 5, 8)>
<4, (5, 9)>
<7, (0, 1, 8)>
<8, (0, 1, 2)>
<8, (2, 4, 7)>
<9, (0, 3, 6)>
<9, (4, 5, 6)>
<9, (7, 8)>
