Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 6

Response:
To find the 3-stars in the graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will be the centers of the 3-stars.

Identifying the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 6, and 7
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 7, and 8
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 8

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the graph are:
<2, (3, 6, 7)>
<3, (2, 7, 8)>
<6, (2, 5, 8)>

Count of 3-stars in the given graph: [3]
