Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star pattern, which consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list the 3-stars in this graph:

<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<0, (3, 5, 7)>
<2, (3, 5, 4)>
<3, (0, 2, 5)>
<3, (0, 4, 5)>
<3, (2, 4, 5)>
<5, (0, 2, 3)>
<5, (0, 3, 4)>
<5, (2, 3, 8)>
<5, (4, 3, 8)>
<7, (0, 5, 8)>
<8, (5, 3, 7)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we find a total of [12]. 
Therefore, the final answer is [12].
