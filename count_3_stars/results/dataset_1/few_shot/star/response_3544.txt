Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 6

Response:
To find all the 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes directly. Let's find them step by step:

1. Nodes 0 and 1 form a 3-star with nodes 3 and 9:
    <0, (1, 3, 9)>
   
2. Nodes 1 and 3 form a 3-star with nodes 0 and 2:
    <1, (0, 2, 3)>
   
3. Nodes 2 and 3 form a 3-star with nodes 1 and 5:
    <2, (1, 3, 5)>
   
4. Nodes 3 and 5 form a 3-star with nodes 2 and 6:
    <3, (2, 5, 6)>
    
5. Nodes 5 and 6 form a 3-star with nodes 3 and 8:
    <5, (3, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
