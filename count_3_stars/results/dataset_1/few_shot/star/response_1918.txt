Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 8
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 5, 7, and node 8

Response:
There are two 3-stars in the given graph. 

The 3-stars are:
1. <0, (4, 6, 7)>
2. <5, (1, 6, 7)> 

Therefore, the final answer is [2].
