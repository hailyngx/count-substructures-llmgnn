Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Since a 3-star requires a central node connected to three other nodes, we can search for nodes with exactly three neighbors. Let's go step by step:

1. Identify nodes with exactly three neighbors:
   - Node 2 has 2 neighbors.
   - Node 9 has 2 neighbors.
   - All other nodes have more than three neighbors.

2. Check all edges incident on each node with more than three neighbors to see if there are any 3-stars:
   
   - For Node 0:
     - <0, (3, 7, 8)> [Potential 3-star]

   - For Node 1:
     - <1, (2, 5, 6)> [Potential 3-star]

   - For Node 3:
     - <3, (0, 6, 8)> [Potential 3-star]

   - For Node 4:
     - No 3-stars can be formed as it only has 2 neighbors.

   - For Node 5:
     - <5, (1, 7, 8)> [Potential 3-star]

   - For Node 6:
     - <6, (1, 3, 8)> [Potential 3-star]

   - For Node 7:
     - <7, (0, 4, 8)> [Potential 3-star]
     - <7, (5, 8, 9)> [Potential 3-star]

   - For Node 8:
     - <8, (0, 3, 6)> [Potential 3-star]
     - <8, (4, 5, 7)> [Potential 3-star]

3. Count the unique 3-stars found:
   - <0, (3, 7, 8)>
   - <1, (2, 5, 6)>
   - <3, (0, 6, 8)>
   - <5, (1, 7, 8)>
   - <6, (1, 3, 8)>
   - <7, (0, 4, 8)>
   - <7, (5, 8, 9)>
   - <8, (0, 3, 6)>
   - <8, (4, 5, 7)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
