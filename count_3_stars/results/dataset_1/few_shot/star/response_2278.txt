Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's examine each node to see if it is the center of a 3-star. 

Starting from each node, we will look for nodes that are adjacent to it and form a 3-star if connected to each other through the central node. 

Let's begin by listing the 3-stars we find:

<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<0, (1, 4, 9)>
<0, (4, 5, 9)>
<1, (0, 4, 7)>
<1, (3, 6, 7)>
<1, (4, 6, 7)>
<4, (0, 1, 9)>
<4, (2, 9, 7)>
<6, (1, 5, 8)>
<7, (1, 3, 9)>

Finally, we count the total number of 3-stars in the given graph:
