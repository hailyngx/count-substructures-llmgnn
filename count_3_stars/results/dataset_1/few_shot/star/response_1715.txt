Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 6

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. Specifically, we are looking for nodes that act as the center of a 3-star. 

From the given adjacency list, we can see that the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes are:
- Node 0 (connected to nodes 8, 9 and 0)
- Node 3 (connected to nodes 6, 9 and 0)
- Node 7 (connected to nodes 2, 5 and 7)

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
- <0, (8, 9, 0)>
- <3, (6, 9, 0)>
- <7, (2, 5, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
