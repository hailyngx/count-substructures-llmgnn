Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 6) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 1
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 4

Response:
There are two 3-stars in this graph. 

The 3-stars are:
<1, (0, 4, 7)>
<6, (2, 3, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
