Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for the nodes that have exactly three neighbors, as these nodes represent potential centers of 3-stars in the graph.

Based on the provided adjacency list, the nodes that have exactly three neighbors are:
- Node 1: Connected to nodes 2, 3, and 9
- Node 5: Connected to nodes 2 and 9
- Node 9: Connected to nodes 0, 1, and 5

Therefore, the 3-stars in the given graph are:
<1, (2, 3, 9)>
<5, (2, 9, 0)>
<9, (0, 1, 5)>

There are 3 unique 3-stars in total, so the final answer is [3].
