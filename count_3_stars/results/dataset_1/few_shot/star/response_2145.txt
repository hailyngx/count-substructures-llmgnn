Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 5

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

From the adjacency list, we can see that the potential center nodes for 3-stars are: 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

Now, let's list down the 3-stars:

- <2, (0, 4, 5)>
- <4, (2, 5, 7)>
- <5, (2, 4, 9)>
- <6, (0, 3, 7)>
- <7, (3, 4, 6)>
- <8, (6, 7, 0)>
- <9, (4, 5, 2)>

Now, counting the total number of 3-stars gives us [7].
