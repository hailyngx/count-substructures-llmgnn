Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify every 3-star pattern in the graph. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we see the following connections to each node:

- Node 0 is connected to 2, 3, and 6
- Node 1 is connected to 2
- Node 2 is connected to 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, and 9
- Node 3 is connected to 0, 2, 6, and 8
- Node 4 is connected to 6 and 9
- Node 5 is connected to 2 and 7
- Node 6 is connected to 0, 3, and 4
- Node 7 is connected to 2, 5, 8, and 9
- Node 8 is connected to 2, 3, and 7
- Node 9 is connected to 2, 4, and 7

From the connections above, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (2, 3, 6)>
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<2, (5, 7, 8)>
<2, (7, 8, 9)>
<3, (0, 2, 6)>
<7, (2, 5, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
