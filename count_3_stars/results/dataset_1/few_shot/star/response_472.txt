Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 5
