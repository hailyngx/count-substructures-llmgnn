Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, creating a 3-star pattern with that node as the center.

Let's go through the graph and identify the unique 3-stars:
1. Node 0: (1, 8, 9)
2. Node 3: (2, 4, 6)
3. Node 5: (1, 7, 9)
4. Node 6: (1, 3, 4)

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars: 
[4] 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 8, 9)>
<3, (2, 4, 6)>
<5, (1, 7, 9)>
<6, (1, 3, 4)>
