Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 9) (9, 1) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 7

Response:
First, let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0: <0, (2, 3, 4)> 
2. Node 1: <1, (2, 4, 9)>
3. Node 2: <2, (0, 1, 6)>
4. Node 7: <7, (0, 9, 7)>

So, there are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
