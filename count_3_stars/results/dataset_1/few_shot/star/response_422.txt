Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. 
Here are the 3-stars in the given graph:
[<0, (2, 3, 4)>]
[<0, (2, 3, 5)>]
[<0, (2, 4, 5)>]
[<3, (0, 4, 7)>]
[<3, (0, 5, 7)>]
[<3, (0, 5, 8)>]
[<3, (4, 7, 6)>]
[<3, (5, 6, 7)>]
[<3, (5, 6, 9)>]
[<6, (5, 7, 9)>]
[<7, (3, 4, 6)>]
[<7, (3, 6, 9)>]
[<7, (4, 6, 9)>]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
