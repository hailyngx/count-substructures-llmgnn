Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) (4, 1) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Given the graph description, let's find all 3-stars:

1. Node 1: (1, 2, 4, 5) - Since node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 5, it forms a 3-star.
2. Node 6: (6, 0, 5, 8) - Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 5, and 8, forming another 3-star.
3. Node 7: (7, 0, 2, 9) - Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 9, forming a 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
The unique 3-stars found are: <1, (2, 4, 5)>, <6, (0, 5, 8)>, <7, (0, 2, 9)>.
