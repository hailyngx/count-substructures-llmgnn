Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 6
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all possible 3-stars where a node serves as the center and it is connected to exactly 3 other nodes by edges. Let's identify them step by step:

1. Node 0: Not a center of any 3-star.
2. Node 1: Not a center of any 3-star.
3. Node 2: Not a center of any 3-star.
4. Node 3: Possible 3-stars include <3, (1, 5, 6)> and <3, (5, 6, 8)>.
5. Node 4: Not connected to any other nodes, so it cannot be a center.
6. Node 5: Possible 3-stars include <5, (0, 3, 7)> and <5, (3, 6, 8)>.
7. Node 6: Possible 3-stars include <6, (3, 8, 9)>.
8. Node 7: Not a center of any 3-star.
9. Node 8: Not a center of any 3-star.
10. Node 9: Not a center of any 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3]. The unique 3-stars found are <3, (1, 5, 6)>, <3, (5, 6, 8)>, and <6, (3, 8, 9)>.
