Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes (forming a 3-star pattern). 

Based on the provided adjacency list, the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes and thus form 3-stars are:
- Node 0: (1, 2, 3), (0, 1, 6), (0, 2, 6), (0, 3, 6)
- Node 1: (0, 1, 3), (1, 3, 6), (1, 6, 7)
- Node 3: (0, 1, 3), (2, 3, 4), (3, 4, 7)
- Node 4: (3, 4, 7), (4, 5, 8)
- Node 6: (0, 1, 6), (1, 6, 7), (5, 6, 9)
- Node 9: (5, 6, 9), (6, 8, 9)

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are:
<0, (1, 2, 3)>, <0, (1, 6, 3)>, <0, (2, 6, 3)>, <0, (3, 6, 0)>, <1, (0, 3, 6)>, <1, (6, 7, 1)>, <3, (0, 1, 3)>, <3, (2, 4, 3)>, <3, (4, 7, 3)>, <4, (3, 7, 4)>, <4, (5, 8, 4)>, <6, (0, 1, 6)>, <6, (1, 7, 6)>, <6, (5, 9, 6)>, <9, (5, 6, 9)>, <9, (6, 8, 9)>

Count of 3-stars: [16]
