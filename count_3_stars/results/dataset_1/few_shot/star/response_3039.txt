Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 8

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph:

1. <0, (1, 4, 6)>
2. <0, (1, 7, 9)>
3. <2, (3, 4, 8)>
4. <2, (3, 5, 8)>
5. <2, (4, 5, 8)>
6. <4, (0, 2, 5)>
7. <7, (0, 9, 1)>
8. <8, (1, 2, 9)>
9. <8, (2, 4, 9)>
10. <8, (2, 5, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [10].
