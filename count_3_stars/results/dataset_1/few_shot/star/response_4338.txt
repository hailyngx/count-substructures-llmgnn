Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node and its connected nodes. Then we look for configurations where the central node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Given the adjacency list, we can see the following connections between nodes:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 6, and 7.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 4 and 5.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0 and 5.
- Node 3 is connected to node 8.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 5, 6, and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, 8, and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0 and 4.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0 and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 7, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 8.

Now, let's list the 3-star configurations in the graph:
