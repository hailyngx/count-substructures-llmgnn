Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will be the centers of the 3-stars.

Based on the provided adjacency list, the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes are:
- Node 0 (connected to nodes 4, 5, 6, 9)
- Node 2 (connected to nodes 7, 8, 9)

Now we will determine the 3-stars involving these nodes:
1. For Node 0:
   - <0, (4, 5, 6)>
   - <0, (4, 5, 9)>
   - <0, (4, 6, 9)>
   - <0, (5, 6, 9)>
  
2. For Node 2:
   - <2, (7, 8, 9)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars, we have found 5 unique 3-stars. Therefore, the answer is [5].
