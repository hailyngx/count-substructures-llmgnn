Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 4

Response:
Step 1: Identify potential 3-stars
- Node 0: No 3-star as it is connected to fewer than 3 nodes.
- Node 1: No 3-star as it is connected to fewer than 3 nodes.
- Node 2: Potential 3-stars with nodes 6, 7, 8 and nodes 6, 8, 9.
- Node 3: Potential 3-stars with nodes 0, 1, and nodes 6, 6. (Duplicates not counted)
- Node 4: No 3-star as it is connected to fewer than 3 nodes.
- Node 5: No 3-star as it is connected to fewer than 3 nodes.
- Node 6: Potential 3-stars with nodes 2, 3, and nodes 5, 8.
- Node 7: Potential 3-stars with nodes 0, 2, 4 and nodes 2, 4, 8.
- Node 8: Potential 3-stars with nodes 2, 5, 6 and nodes 2, 7, 8.
- Node 9: No 3-star as it is connected to fewer than 3 nodes.

Step 2: Count the number of unique 3-stars
- Count of unique 3-stars: 5

Step 3: List the unique 3-stars
<2, (6, 7, 8)>
<3, (0, 1, 6)>
<6, (2, 3, 8)>
<7, (0, 2, 4)>
<8, (2, 5, 6)>
