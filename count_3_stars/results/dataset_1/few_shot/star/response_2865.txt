Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's identify the 3-stars:

1. Node 2 is a part of a 3-star: <2, (0, 1, 9)>
2. Node 6 is a part of two 3-stars: <6, (0, 1, 7)> and <6, (3, 0, 1)>

Therefore, there are `[3]` 3-stars in the given graph.
