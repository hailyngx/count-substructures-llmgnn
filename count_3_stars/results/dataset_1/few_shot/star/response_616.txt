Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 7) (2, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 4

Response:
There are two 3-stars in the given graph. Here are the unique 3-stars found:

<0, (6, 9)>
<1, (4, 6, 8)>
