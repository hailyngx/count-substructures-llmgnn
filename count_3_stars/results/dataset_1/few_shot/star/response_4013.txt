Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, and node 8

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:
    
    We observe that a 3-star can only be formed around nodes that have degree 3. These nodes can serve as the center of the 3-star.
    
    From the given adjacency list:
    
    Nodes 0, 3, and 8 have degree 3. These nodes can potentially serve as the centers of 3-stars.
    
    For node 0:
    <0, (1, 3, 8)>
    
    For node 3:
    <3, (0, 5, 7)>
    
    For node 8:
    <8, (0, 7, 9)>
    
    Therefore, there are 3 unique 3-stars in the given graph.
