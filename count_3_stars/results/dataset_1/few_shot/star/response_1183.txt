Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 5
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern where one node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Looking at the adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars:
1. <0, (3, 6)>
2. <1, (3, 9)>
3. <2, (6, 8, 9)>
4. <3, (0, 1, 5)>
5. <5, (3, 6, 9)>
6. <6, (0, 2, 5)>
7. <8, (2, 6, 7)>
8. <9, (1, 2, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
