Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in the form of a 3-star pattern.

Given the connections in the graph, the 3-stars in this graph are:
<0, (4, 5)>
<1, (4, 6)>
<2, (5, 8)>
<6, (1, 4, 9)>

Counting the unique 3-stars:
