Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 5

Response:
Given the definition of a 3-star graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's find these 3-star structures in the given graph step-by-step: 

1. Identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
   - Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 9
   - Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 7
   - Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 9
   - Node 4 is connected to nodes 6, 7, and 8

2. Create a list of all unique 3-stars found:
   <0, (1, 2, 9)>
   <1, (0, 2, 7)>
   <2, (0, 1, 9)>
   <4, (6, 7, 8)>

Now, count the number of unique 3-stars listed above to get the final answer:
