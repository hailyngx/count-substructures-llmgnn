Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, and node 8

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 

The possible 3-stars can be identified by looking for nodes connected to exactly three other nodes. 

From the given adjacency list, the 3-stars are as follows:
1. <0, (1, 7, 8)> 
2. <1, (0, 3, 5)>
3. <4, (0, 8, 9)>
4. <8, (0, 5, 6)>
5. <9, (2, 4, 6)>

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars in the graph. 
So, we have [5] unique 3-stars in the graph: 
<0, (1, 7, 8)>, <1, (0, 3, 5)>, <4, (0, 8, 9)>, <8, (0, 5, 6)>, <9, (2, 4, 6)>
