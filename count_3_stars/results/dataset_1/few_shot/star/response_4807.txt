Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 6

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the unique 3-stars where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we see that nodes 0, 1, 6, and 7 have degree 4, which means they can be the center of a 3-star. Let's start by listing the 3-stars for each of these potential central nodes:

For node 0:
<0, (2, 6, 8)>
<0, (2, 6, 9)>

For node 1:
<1, (2, 3, 5)>
<1, (2, 5, 6)>
<1, (3, 5, 6)>
<1, (5, 6, 7)>

For node 6:
<6, (0, 1, 5)>
<6, (0, 5, 8)>
<6, (0, 5, 9)>
<6, (1, 5, 8)>
<6, (1, 5, 9)>
<6, (5, 8, 9)>

For node 7:
<7, (1, 2, 3)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we have: 
[6]
