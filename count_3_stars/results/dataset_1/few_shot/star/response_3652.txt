Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we can examine each node and its neighbors to see if they form a 3-star configuration. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

1. For Node 0:
   - Node 0 is not part of any 3-star.

2. For Node 1:
   - The neighbors of Node 1: 2, 3, 6, 8
   - Possible 3-stars involving Node 1: <1, (2, 6, 8)>

3. For Node 2:
   - The neighbors of Node 2: 1, 5, 7, 9
   - Possible 3-stars involving Node 2: <2, (1, 5, 7)>, <2, (1, 5, 9)>

4. For Node 3:
   - The neighbors of Node 3: 1, 5
   - Node 3 is not part of any 3-star.

5. For Node 4:
   - The neighbors of Node 4: 0, 8, 9
   - Node 4 is not part of any 3-star.

6. For Node 5:
   - The neighbors of Node 5: 2, 3, 7, 9
   - Possible 3-stars involving Node 5: <5, (2, 7, 9)>

7. For Node 6:
   - The neighbors of Node 6: 1, 9
   - Node 6 is not part of any 3-star.

8. For Node 7:
   - The neighbors of Node 7: 2, 5, 8
   - Node 7 is not part of any 3-star.

9. For Node 8:
   - The neighbors of Node 8: 1, 4, 7
   - Node 8 is not part of any 3-star.

10. For Node 9:
    - The neighbors of Node 9: 2, 4, 5, 6
    - Node 9 is not part of any 3-star.

Count of 3-stars: [2]
Unique 3-stars: <<1, (2, 6, 8)>, <2, (1, 5, 7)>]
