Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to find all the unique 3-stars present in the graph.

Let's list the unique 3-stars with their central node and leaves:

<0, (3, 9, 7)>
<2, (4, 6, 9)>
<4, (2, 6, 7)>
<7, (3, 4, 9)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph [4].
