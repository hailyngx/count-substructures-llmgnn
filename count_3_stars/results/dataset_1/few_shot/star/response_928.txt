Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 3

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's find the 3-stars present in the graph:

1. Node 1 can form a 3-star with the following groups:
   - <1, (0, 2, 3)>
   - <1, (6, 7, 8)>
   - <1, (2, 4, 9)>
   - <1, (3, 5, 9)>

Thus, there are a total of [4] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
