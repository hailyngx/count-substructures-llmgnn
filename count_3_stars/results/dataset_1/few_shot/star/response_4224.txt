Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 6, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star pattern. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Looking at the given graph, we can find the following 3-stars:
<0, (2, 7)>
<1, (3, 5, 6)>
<2, (0, 4, 6)>
<3, (1, 6, 8)>
<6, (1, 2, 3)>
<9, (3, 7, 8)>

Count of 3-stars: [6]
