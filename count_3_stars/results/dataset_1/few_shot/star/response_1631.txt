Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 3

Response:
The graph can be visualized as follows:

```
   (1)----(2)----(5)
    |      |      |
   (0)----(6)----(4)
    |      |      
   (8)----(7)   
    |       
   (3)   
    |
   (9)   
```

To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to find all possible combinations where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes via edges.

Let's list the 3-stars:
<0, (1, 2, 6)>
<1, (0, 2, 6)>
<2, (0, 1, 5)>
<4, (5, 6, 0)>
<5, (2, 4, 6)>
<6, (0, 1, 4)>
<8, (0, 1, 7)>
<7, (2, 8, 7)>

Therefore, there are a total of [8] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
