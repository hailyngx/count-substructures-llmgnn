Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 7

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph:

- There is one 3-star with center node 0 and leaves 2, 6.
- There is one 3-star with center node 2 and leaves 0, 8.
- There is one 3-star with center node 4 and leaves 5, 6.
- There is one 3-star with center node 5 and leaves 4, 8.
- There is one 3-star with center node 6 and leaves 0, 4, 7.
- There is one 3-star with center node 7 and leaves 6, 8, 9.
- There is one 3-star with center node 8 and leaves 2, 5, 7.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7]. 

Unique 3-stars found: 
<0, (2, 6)>
<2, (0, 8)>
<4, (5, 6)>
<5, (4, 8)>
<6, (0, 4, 7)>
<7, (6, 8, 9)>
<8, (2, 5, 7)>
