Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and node 7

Response:
First, let's identify all possible 3-stars in the given graph. 

For each node, we will look at its neighbors to see if there is a 3-star centered at that node. 

Here are the unique 3-stars found:

<0, (3, 5, 9)>
<4, (6, 7, 8)>
<5, (0, 6, 8)>
<6, (4, 5, 9)>
<7, (2, 4, 9)>
<8, (4, 5, -)>
<9, (0, 1, 3)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars.
