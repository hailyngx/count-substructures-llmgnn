Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 7

Response:
To find the 3-stars in the given graph, we look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Based on the given information, the 3-stars can be identified as follows:

<0, (1, 2, 8)>
<2, (0, 4, 5)>
<4, (2, 3, 7)>
<7, (3, 4, 9)>

Therefore, there are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.
