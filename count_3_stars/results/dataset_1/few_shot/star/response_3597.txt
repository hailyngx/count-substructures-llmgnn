Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. These instances represent 3-stars with the node as the center and the three connected nodes as the leaves.

Looking at the adjacency list provided, we can identify the following 3-stars:  
<0, (1, 5, 6)>  
<1, (0, 7, 9)>  
<2, (6, 9, -)> (Incomplete)  
<3, (4, 5, 6)>  
<5, (0, 3, 9)>  

Therefore, there are [5] unique 3-stars in the graph.
