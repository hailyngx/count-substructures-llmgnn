Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique configurations of 3-stars. Let's start by listing them:

<1, (0, 5, 8)>
<3, (5, 6, 8)>
<6, (3, 4, 9)>
<8, (1, 3, 9)>

Based on the given graph and the configurations of 3-stars listed above, we can now determine the total number of 3-stars in the graph by counting the occurrences of each unique configuration. Let's do that and then provide the final answer inside brackets:
