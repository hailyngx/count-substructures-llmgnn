Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

In this graph, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (4, 5, 7)>
<1, (2, 5, 7)>
<2, (1, 3, 6)>
<7, (0, 1, 9)>

Therefore, there are a total of [4] 3-stars in the given graph.
