Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, 6, and node 8

Response:
Since we are looking for 3-star graphs, we need to find the central node and its three adjacent nodes. Let's go through the given information step by step:

1. Node 0: (1, 8, 9)
   This does not form a 3-star because it has 3 adjacent nodes instead of the required 3 edges.
   
2. Node 1: (0, 3, 6)
   This forms a 3-star: <1, (0, 3, 6)>
   
3. Node 2: (7)
   This does not form a 3-star because it has only 1 adjacent node.
   
4. Node 3: (1, 5, 7)
   This forms a 3-star: <3, (1, 5, 7)>
   
5. Node 4: (5, 9)
   This does not form a 3-star because it has 2 adjacent nodes.
   
6. Node 5: (3, 4, 8, 9)
   This does not form any additional 3-stars since the ones with Node 3 and Node 4 have already been counted.
   
7. Node 6: (1, 7, 9)
   This forms a 3-star: <6, (1, 7, 9)>
   
8. Node 7: (2, 3, 6)
   This does not form any additional 3-stars since the one with Node 3 has already been counted.
   
9. Node 8: (0, 5, 9)
   This does not form a 3-star because it has 3 adjacent nodes instead of the required 3 edges.
   
10. Node 9: (0, 4, 5, 6, 8)
    This does not form any additional 3-stars since the ones with Node 1, Node 3, and Node 6 have already been counted.
    
Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: <<1, (0, 3, 6)>, <3, (1, 5, 7)>, <6, (1, 7, 9)>>.
