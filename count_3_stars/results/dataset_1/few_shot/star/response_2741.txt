Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 8

Response:
Given the information provided, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph by looking for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's find the 3-stars step-by-step:

1. Starting with Node 0: Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 8.
   - <0, (1, 3, 8)>

2. Moving to Node 1: Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 5.
   - <1, (0, 2, 5)>

3. Moving to Node 2: Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 9.
   - <2, (1, 3, 9)>

4. Moving to Node 3: Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 5.
   - <3, (0, 2, 5)>

5. Moving to Node 4: Node 4 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 9.
   - <4, (5, 6, 9)>

6. Moving to Node 5: Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, and 9.
   - <5, (1, 3, 4)>
   - <5, (1, 3, 9)>
   - <5, (1, 4, 9)>
   - <5, (3, 4, 9)>

7. Moving to Node 6: Node 6 is connected only to Node 4, which is not a 3-star configuration.

8. Moving to Node 7: Node 7 is connected only to Node 3, which is not a 3-star configuration.

9. Moving to Node 8: Node 8 is connected to nodes 0 and 9.
   - <8, (0, 9)>

10. Moving to Node 9: Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 5, and 8.
   - <9, (2, 4, 5)>
   - <9, (2, 4, 8)>
   - <9, (2, 5, 8)>
   - <9, (4, 5, 8)>

Counting the unique 3-stars found, we get a total of [10].
