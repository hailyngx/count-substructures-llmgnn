Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we can see that the nodes connected to exactly three other nodes are: 
- Node 0: connected to nodes 1, 2, 5
- Node 1: connected to nodes 0, 2, 5
- Node 2: connected to nodes 0, 1, 4
- Node 4: connected to nodes 2, 3, 5
- Node 5: connected to nodes 0, 1, 2

Therefore, there are 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph: 
<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<1, (0, 2, 5)>
<2, (0, 1, 4)>
<4, (2, 3, 5)>
<5, (0, 1, 2)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
