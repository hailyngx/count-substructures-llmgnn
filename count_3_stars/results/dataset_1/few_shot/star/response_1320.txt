Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph given, we need to identify each 3-star configuration in the graph. 

Let's list down the unique 3-stars present in the graph:

- <1, (2, 3, 5)>
- <1, (5, 8, 9)>
- <3, (1, 4, 9)>
- <5, (1, 6, 8)>
- <8, (1, 5, 9)>
- <9, (2, 3, 6)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars in the graph, we find that there are [6] 3-stars in total.
