Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and node 8

Response:
From the given graph information, we can identify the 3-stars as follows:

<Node 0, (3, 5, 6)>  
<Node 1, (2, 3, 9)>
<Node 2, (1, 4, 8)>
<Node 3, (0, 5, 6)>
<Node 6, (0, 3, 7)>
<Node 9, (1, 2, 8)>

Therefore, there are [6] unique 3-stars in the graph.
