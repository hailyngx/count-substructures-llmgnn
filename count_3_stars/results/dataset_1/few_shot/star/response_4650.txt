Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 6, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars, we need to identify patterns where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Given the information about connections between nodes, we can analyze each node to see if they form any 3-stars. 

Here is a list of unique 3-stars found in the given graph:
<2, (0, 3, 7)>
<2, (4, 6, 7)>
<2, (6, 5, 7)>
<6, (4, 9, 7)>
<6, (5, 7, 8)>
