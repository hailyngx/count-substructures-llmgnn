Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 5

Response:
The 3-star graphs in this given graph are as follows:
<0, (2, 5, 9)>
<1, (2, 3, 6)>
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<2, (0, 5, 6)>
<2, (1, 3, 7)>
<2, (3, 5, 9)>
<5, (0, 2, 6)>
<5, (0, 6, 9)>
<6, (1, 2, 5)>
<6, (1, 2, 7)>
<6, (2, 5, 7)>
<9, (0, 4, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
