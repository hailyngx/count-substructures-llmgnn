Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 0) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible sets of 3 nodes that form a 3-star structure around a central node. 

Let's go through each node one by one to identify the 3-stars:
1. For Node 0: <0, (1, 2, 4)>, <0, (1, 4, 5)>, <0, (1, 4, 7)>, <0, (2, 4, 5)>, <0, (2, 4, 7)>, <0, (5, 4, 7)>
2. For Node 1: No 3-stars can be formed around Node 1.
3. For Node 2: No 3-stars can be formed around Node 2.
4. For Node 3: No 3-stars can be formed around Node 3.
5. For Node 4: <4, (0, 5, 6)>, <4, (0, 5, 9)>, <4, (5, 6, 7)>
6. For Node 5: No 3-stars can be formed around Node 5.
7. For Node 6: No 3-stars can be formed around Node 6.
8. For Node 7: <7, (0, 1, 3)>
9. For Node 8: No 3-stars can be formed around Node 8.
10. For Node 9: No 3-stars can be formed around Node 9.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10]. 
The unique 3-stars found are <0, (1, 2, 4)>, <0, (1, 4, 5)>, <0, (1, 4, 7)>, <0, (2, 4, 5)>, <0, (2, 4, 7)>, <0, (5, 4, 7)>, <4, (0, 5, 6)>, <4, (0, 5, 9)>, <4, (5, 6, 7)>, and <7, (0, 1, 3)>.
