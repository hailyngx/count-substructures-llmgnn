Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (2, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 7

Response:
Let's find the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

We will first identify the 3-stars present in the graph:
- From the adjacency list, we see that nodes 1, 5, 8, and 9 have exactly 3 connections each. These nodes can be central nodes in 3-stars.
- Let's check each of these nodes as central nodes to see if they form 3-stars.

<1, (5, 3, 8)>
<5, (1, 3, 8)>
<8, (4, 5, 9)>
<9, (4, 7, 8)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph: [4]
