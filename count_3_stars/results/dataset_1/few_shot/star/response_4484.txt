Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 8

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (3, 4, 6)>
2. <0, (3, 4, 9)>
3. <3, (0, 1, 5)>
4. <4, (0, 5, 7)>
5. <5, (3, 4, 8)>
6. <5, (3, 8, 9)>
7. <8, (2, 5, 9)>

Count of 3-stars: [7]
