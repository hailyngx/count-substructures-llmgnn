Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars present in the graph based on the definition provided.

Given the definition of a 3-star as having a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can identify the unique 3-stars present in the graph by looking at each node and its connections.

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<0, (1, 4, 8)>
<0, (3, 4, 6)>
<0, (3, 4, 8)>
<0, (4, 6, 8)>
<1, (0, 4, 6)>
<1, (0, 4, 8)>
<2, (4, 6, 7)>
<2, (6, 7, 8)>
<3, (0, 4, 5)>
<3, (4, 5, 6)>
<3, (4, 5, 9)>
<3, (4, 6, 9)>
<3, (4, 7, 9)>
<3, (5, 4, 9)>
<4, (0, 1, 5)>
<4, (0, 5, 6)>
<4, (0, 5, 7)>
<4, (0, 5, 8)>
<4, (0, 5, 9)>
<4, (1, 6, 7)>
<4, (1, 6, 8)>
<4, (1, 6, 9)>
<4, (3, 5, 6)>
<4, (3, 5, 9)>
<4, (5, 6, 7)>
<4, (5, 6, 9)>
<4, (6, 7, 8)>
<4, (6, 8, 9)>
<4, (7, 8, 9)>
<5, (3, 4, 6)>
<5, (4, 6, 7)>
<6, (0, 2, 4)>
<6, (2, 4, 7)>
<7, (4, 6, 8)>
<7, (6, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 4, 7)>
<8, (0, 4, 9)>
<8, (0, 7, 9)>
<9, (3, 4, 8)>

Now, we count the total number of unique 3-stars listed above and provide the final answer inside brackets:
[39]
