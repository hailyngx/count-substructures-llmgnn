Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's identify the 3-stars first. 

Based on the definition provided, a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's list the possible 3-stars in this graph:

<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<0, (3, 5, 7)>
<0, (4, 5, 7)>
<1, (0, 4, 8)>
<3, (0, 5, 6)>
<4, (0, 8, 9)>
<5, (0, 3, 7)>
<6, (3, 7, 9)>
<7, (2, 5, 6)>
<8, (1, 4, 9)>
<9, (6, 8, 0)>

Count of 3-stars in the graph: [13]
