Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 6
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in this graph is [2].

Unique 3-stars: 
<1, (3, 4, 6)>
<6, (1, 3, 5)>
