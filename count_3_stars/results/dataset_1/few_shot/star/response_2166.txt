Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, 7, and node 8

Response:
The given graph is as follows:

```
    1
    |
    0---5---6---7
    |   |   |
    8---3   4
        |
        9
```

To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to find all instances where a node has exactly 3 neighbors and they form a 3-star configuration by having the central node connected to the other three nodes.

Let's identify the 3-stars:

<0, (5, 8, 9)>
<3, (2, 8, 9)>
<6, (4, 5, 7)>
<8, (0, 3, 9)>
<9, (0, 7, 8)>
