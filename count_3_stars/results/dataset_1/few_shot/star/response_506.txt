Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star-like manner. Since each 3-star has a central node and three connected nodes, we will look for nodes with exactly three neighbors, which will form the leaves of the 3-star.

After examining the adjacency list, we find the following 3-stars:
<2, (4, 8, 5)>
<5, (8, 2, 9)>

Therefore, there are [2] 3-stars in the given graph.
