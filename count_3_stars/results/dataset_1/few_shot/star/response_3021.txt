Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 5
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
First, we need to identify the 3-stars in the graph. To do this, we look for nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them. These nodes will be the centers of the 3-stars.

Looking at the adjacency list, we can see that the nodes 0, 1, 3, 5, 6, and 7 have exactly three edges connected to them.

Next, we list out the 3-stars - each unique 3-star should only be listed once:

<0, (4, 6, 7)>
<1, (2, 4, 8)>
<2, (1, 8, 4)>
<3, (4, 6, 7)>
<4, (0, 1, 3)>
<5, (4, 7, 8)>
<6, (0, 3, 7)>
<7, (0, 3, 5)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars gives us a total of [8].
