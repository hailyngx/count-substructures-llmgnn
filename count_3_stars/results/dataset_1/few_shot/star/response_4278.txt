Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 3

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 
A 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three leaves. 

Observing the graph, we can find the following 3-stars:
<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<1, (0, 4, 6)>
<1, (0, 7, 9)>
<2, (0, 5, 3)>
<3, (5, 9, 0)>
<4, (1, 8, 7)>
<5, (2, 3, 8)>
<6, (1, 8, 0)>
<7, (1, 8, 9)>
<8, (4, 5, 6)>
<9, (1, 3, 7)>

Count the total number of 3-stars: [11]
