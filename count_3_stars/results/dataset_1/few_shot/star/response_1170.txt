Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 5

Response:
First, we need to identify the nodes that are part of a 3-star in the given graph. 
Since a 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes, we need to look for nodes in the graph that have exactly three neighbors. 

By looking at the adjacency list, we can identify the following nodes with exactly three neighbors:
- Node 0 (connected to 1, 5, 9)
- Node 1 (connected to 0, 4, 5)
- Node 2 (connected to 4, 9)
- Node 3 (connected to 6, 9)
- Node 4 (connected to 1, 2, 7)
- Node 7 (connected to 4, 5, 8)
- Node 8 (connected to 6, 7, 8)
- Node 9 (connected to 0, 2, 3)

Next, we need to find the 3-stars in the graph. 

Let's count the number of 3-stars:

[7]

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 5, 9)>
<1, (0, 4, 5)>
<2, (4, 9, 3)>
<4, (1, 2, 7)>
<7, (4, 5, 8)>
<8, (6, 7, 8)>
<9, (0, 2, 3)>
