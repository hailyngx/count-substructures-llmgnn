Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are:
<0, (3, 5, 7)>
<3, (0, 7, 9)>
<5, (0, 2, 6)>
<7, (3, 5, 6)>
