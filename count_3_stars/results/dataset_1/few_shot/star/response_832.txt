Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 8

Response:
Given the graph information provided, let's first identify the 3-stars present in the graph:

<0, (4, 6, 8)>
<4, (0, 3, 8)>
<5, (1, 3, 6)>
<8, (0, 4, 9)>
<9, (2, 5, 8)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars.
