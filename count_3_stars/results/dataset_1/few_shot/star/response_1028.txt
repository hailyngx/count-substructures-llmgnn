Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 6, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the given graph, we can identify the 3-stars by finding nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Here are the unique 3-stars in this graph:

<2, (1, 4, 7)>
<7, (2, 5, 8)>
<9, (2, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
