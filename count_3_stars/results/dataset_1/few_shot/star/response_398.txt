Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 3

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. These instances represent 3-star structures with that node being the center.

Looking at the adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (3, 5, 2)>
<1, (3, 6, 8)>
<2, (3, 5, 0)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<4, (5, 7, -)>
<5, (0, 2, 3)>
<6, (1, 3, -)>
<7, (4, -, -)>
<8, (1, -, -)>
<9, (3, -, -)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars: 
[9]
