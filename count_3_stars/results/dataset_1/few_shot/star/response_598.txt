Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 6) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 8

Response:
First, let's identify the unique 3-stars in the given graph.

The central node of a 3-star can be any node with exactly three edges connected to it. Looking at the adjacency lists, we can see that nodes 3, 4, and 6 are the only nodes that meet this criterion.

For each of these central nodes, we can list the corresponding leaves:
- For node 3: (4, 7) and (7, 4)
- For node 4: (3, 7), (7, 3), (7, 8), and (8, 7)
- For node 6: (0, 6), (1, 6), and (5, 6)

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the graph are:
<3, (4, 7), (7, 4)>
<4, (3, 7), (7, 3)>
<4, (7, 8), (8, 7)>
<6, (0, 6), (1, 6)>
<6, (5, 6)>

Counting them up, we find that there are a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
