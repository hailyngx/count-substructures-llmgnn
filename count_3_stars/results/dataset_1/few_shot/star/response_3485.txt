Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 8

Response:
Let's determine the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

First, let's identify the nodes with exactly three neighbors:
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors

These are the potential central nodes of 3-stars. Now, let's find the 3-stars:

1. For node 8:
   - <8, (0, 3, 6)>
   - <8, (0, 7, 9)>
   - <8, (3, 4, 6)>
   - <8, (3, 7, 9)>

2. For node 4:
   - <4, (0, 3, 5)>
   - <4, (3, 5, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
