Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list down the 3-stars and then count them.

Based on the given information, the possible 3-stars in the graph are:
<0, (5, 6, X)>
<2, (9, X, X)>
<3, (4, 5, X)>
<4, (3, 5, 9)>
<5, (0, 3, 4)>
<6, (0, 9, X)>
<7, (5, 8, X)>
<9, (2, 4, 6)>

Counting the number of 3-stars: [7]
