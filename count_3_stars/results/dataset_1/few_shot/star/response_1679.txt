Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (2, 5) (2, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 2
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars present in the graph. 

Looking at the adjacency list and considering the definition of a 3-star graph, we can identify the following 3-stars:

<0, (4, 5, 7)>
<2, (5, 4, 8)>
<4, (5, 7, 0)>
<5, (2, 4, 6)>
<7, (0, 4, 6)>

There are a total of [5] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
