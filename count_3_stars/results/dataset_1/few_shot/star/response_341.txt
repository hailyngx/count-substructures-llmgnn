Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find the 3-star subgraphs which consist of a center node and three leaf nodes connected to it.

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. <1, (2, 5, 6)>
2. <3, (0, 2, 4)>
3. <5, (1, 3, 7)>
4. <7, (2, 4, 5)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
