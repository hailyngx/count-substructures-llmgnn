Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star structures in the graph. Since a 3-star consists of a center node and 3 other nodes connected to the center, we need to find nodes that are connected to exactly 3 other nodes.

From the given information, we can see that the potential center nodes are: 1, 2, 7, and 8 since they are each connected to exactly 3 other nodes.

Next, let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<1, (7, 8, 9)>
<2, (6, 7, 8)>
<7, (1, 2, 8)>
<8, (1, 2, 7)>

Counting the unique 3-star structures, we find that there are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.
