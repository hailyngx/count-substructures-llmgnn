Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible 3-star subgraphs. 

We can see that a 3-star subgraph can be formed around a node if that node has exactly three connections to other nodes. 

In the given graph, the possible 3-star subgraphs are:
<0, (1, 3, 6)>
<2, (4, 6, 9)>
<4, (2, 6, 8)>
<7, (0, 3, 5)>
<9, (2, 4, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5]. 

Let me know if you need any further assistance!
