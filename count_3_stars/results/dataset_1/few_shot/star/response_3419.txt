Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<1, (6, 7, 9)>
<3, (4, 8, 7)>
<4, (2, 3, 5)>
<6, (0, 1, 9)>
<7, (1, 5, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [5].
