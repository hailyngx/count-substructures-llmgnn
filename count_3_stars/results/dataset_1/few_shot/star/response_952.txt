Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 4

Response:
The 3-star graphs can be identified by finding nodes with exactly three neighbors.

The nodes with exactly three neighbors are:
- Node 4 (neighbors: 0, 1, 2)
- Node 5 (neighbors: 0, 1, 6)
- Node 7 (neighbor: 6)
- Node 9 (neighbors: 0, 4)

There are no other nodes with exactly three neighbors.

Hence, the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is 4.

Therefore, the final answer is [4].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<4, (0, 1, 2)>
<5, (0, 1, 6)>
<7, (6)>
<9, (0, 4)>
