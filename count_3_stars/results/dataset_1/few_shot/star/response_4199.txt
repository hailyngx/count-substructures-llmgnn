Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 6, and 1 (center)
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 7, and 0 (center)
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, and 6 (center)
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 8, and 1 (center)
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 3, and 7 (center)
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 4, and 6 (center)
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 7, and 1 (center)

Thus, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is: [7]  
The unique 3-stars are given as: <0, (3, 6, 1)>, <1, (3, 7, 0)>, <3, (0, 1, 6)>, <4, (7, 8, 1)>, <6, (0, 3, 7)>, <7, (1, 4, 6)>, <8, (4, 7, 1)>
