Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 5

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (1, 8, 2)>
<1, (0, 4, 7)>
<2, (8, 9, 0)>
<3, (4, 7, 9)>
<4, (1, 3, 6)>
<5, (6, 9, 5)>
<6, (4, 5, 7)>
<7, (1, 3, 6)>
<8, (0, 2, 6)>
<9, (2, 3, 5)>

There are 10 unique 3-stars in total. Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
