Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 6) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 5

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- Node 0 forms a 3-star: <0, (1, 8, 9)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (0, 2, 8)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star: <4, (6, 8, 9)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star: <8, (0, 1, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4] <0, (1, 8, 9)>, <1, (0, 2, 8)>, <4, (6, 8, 9)>, <8, (0, 1, 4)>.
