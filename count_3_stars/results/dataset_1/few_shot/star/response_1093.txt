Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 3

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first analyze the structure and connectivity of the graph based on the provided information.

Given graph information:
- Number of Nodes: 10
- Number of Edges: 32

Based on the definition of a 3-star graph, we are looking for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes via edges with a center node. Each 3-star consists of a central node and three leaf nodes.

Let's identify the 3-stars:

<0, (2, 4, 9)>
<2, (0, 7, 8)>
<4, (0, 1, 8)>
<5, (0, 3, 6)>
<8, (1, 2, 4)>
<8, (6, 7, 4)>
