Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars. 
Based on the definition provided, we are looking for central nodes connected to exactly three other nodes (leaves).

Let's find the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 2:
   - (2, 0, 8) forms a 3-star with node 2 as the center and nodes 0 and 8 as the leaves.
   - (2, 1, 4) forms a 3-star with node 2 as the center and nodes 1 and 4 as the leaves.
   - (2, 7, 6) forms a 3-star with node 2 as the center and nodes 7 and 6 as the leaves.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
The unique 3-stars found are: 
<2, (0, 8, 1)>
<2, (1, 4, 2)>
<2, (7, 6, 2)>
