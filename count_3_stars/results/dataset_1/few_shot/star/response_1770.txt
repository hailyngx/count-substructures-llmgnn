Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 4

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star patterns in the graph. 

- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 8, and 9. 
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 4, and 5. 
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 5, and 6. 
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 2, and 5. 
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 3, and 4. 
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, and 5. 
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 5, and 9. 
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 4, and 8. 

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8]. 

Unique 3-stars:
<1, (6, 8, 9)>
<2, (3, 4, 5)>
<3, (2, 5, 6)>
<4, (0, 2, 5)>
<5, (2, 3, 4)>
<6, (1, 3, 5)>
<8, (1, 5, 9)>
<9, (1, 4, 8)>
