Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the 3-stars by looking for nodes that have exactly three edges. Let's start by listing the 3-stars in this graph:

<0, (1, 3)>
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<2, (1, 5, 6)>
<3, (0, 1, 4)>
<4, (1, 3, 5)>
<5, (1, 2, 4)>
<6, (2, 3, 5)>
<7, (6, 2)>
<8, (5)>
<9, (4, 5, 6)>

Now, we count the total number of 3-stars by looking at the list above. 
So there are a total of [10] 3-stars in the graph.
