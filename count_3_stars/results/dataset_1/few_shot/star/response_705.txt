Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, and node 7

Response:
The 3-stars in this graph can be identified by looking for nodes with exactly three neighbors connected to them. Let's find them step-by-step:

1. Node 1 is a center of a 3-star: <1, (5, 7, 8)>
2. Node 2 is NOT a center of a 3-star as it has only two neighbors.
3. Node 3 is a center of a 3-star: <3, (2, 7, 1)>
4. Node 4 is NOT a center of a 3-star as it has only one neighbor.
5. Node 5 is a center of a 3-star: <5, (1, 2, 7)>
6. Node 6 is NOT a center of a 3-star as it has only two neighbors.
7. Node 7 is a center of a 3-star: <7, (1, 3, 5)>
8. Node 8 is NOT a center of a 3-star as it has four neighbors.
9. Node 9 is NOT a center of a 3-star as it has two neighbors.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3]. 

The unique 3-stars found are: <<1, (5, 7, 8)>, <3, (2, 7, 1)>, <5, (1, 2, 7)>>.
