Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph, we can simply look for nodes that have exactly three neighbors. Each such node will be the center of a 3-star graph. 

The nodes with 3 neighbors are:
- Node 2 (neighbors: 4, 6, 8)
- Node 3 (neighbors: 5, 7, 9)
- Node 5 (neighbors: 3, 7, 9)
- Node 6 (neighbors: 2, 7, 8)
- Node 8 (neighbors: 2, 6)

Therefore, there are <2, (4, 6, 8)>, <3, (5, 7, 9)>, <5, (3, 7, 9)>, <6, (2, 7, 8)>, and <8, (2, 6)>.

Count of 3-star graphs: [5]
