Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 7

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star subgraphs in the given graph:
1. Node 0 is the center, connected to nodes 2, 4, and 5 <0, (2, 4, 5)>
2. Node 1 is the center, connected to nodes 5 and 6 <1, (5, 6)>
3. Node 2 is the center, connected to nodes 0 and 5 <2, (0, 5)>
4. Node 3 doesn't form a 3-star as it has only two neighbors.
5. Node 4 doesn't form a 3-star as it has only one neighbor.
6. Node 5 is the center, connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 6, 7, and 8 <5, (0, 1, 2)>
7. Node 6 is the center, connected to nodes 1, 5, and 7 <6, (1, 5, 7)>
8. Node 7 is the center, connected to nodes 3, 5, 6, and 9 <7, (3, 5, 6)>
9. Node 8 doesn't form a 3-star as it has only two neighbors.
10. Node 9 doesn't form a 3-star as it has only three neighbors but one of them is missing in the given edges.

Count of 3-stars: [6]
Unique 3-stars: <0, (2, 4, 5)>, <1, (5, 6)>, <2, (0, 5)>, <5, (0, 1, 2)>, <6, (1, 5, 7)>, <7, (3, 5, 6)>
