Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all unique 3-stars present in the graph.

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (4, 8, 3)>
<1, (5, 6, 3)>
<2, (6, 7, 9)>
<4, (0, 3, 5)>
<5, (1, 4, 7)>
<6, (1, 2, 7)>
<7, (2, 5, 6)>
