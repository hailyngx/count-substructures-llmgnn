Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star structure.

By examining the adjacency list for each node, we can identify the following 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<0, (1, 2, 6)>
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<0, (2, 5, 6)>
<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<4, (5, 6, 8)>

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [11].
