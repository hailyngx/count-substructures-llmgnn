Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a 3-star pattern. Below are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (5, 7, 4)>
<4, (2, 5, 9)>
<5, (0, 4, 7)>
<9, (4, 5, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
