Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 1

Response:
Following the definition of a 3-star graph, we need to find the instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we find the following 3-stars: 
<2, (1, 3, 6)>
<3, (0, 2, 5)>
<6, (2, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
