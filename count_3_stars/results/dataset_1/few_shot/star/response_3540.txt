Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 6

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes (forming a 3-star) based on the given edges. 

Here are the 3-stars in the graph:
[13]

<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<1, (7, 8, 5)>
<2, (0, 4, 9)>
<3, (4, 7, 9)>
<4, (0, 2, 6)>
<5, (4, 7, 9)>
<6, (4, 7, 9)>
<7, (1, 3, 6)>
<8, (1, 3, 6)>
<9, (2, 3, 5)>
