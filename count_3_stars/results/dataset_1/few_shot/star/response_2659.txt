Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 9) (5, 8) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 3

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:

<[1, (6, 7)]>
<[2, (3, 8)]>
<[3, (2, 9)]>
<[5, (8)]>
<[7, (1, 8)]>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
