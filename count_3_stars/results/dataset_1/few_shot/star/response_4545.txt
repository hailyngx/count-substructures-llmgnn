Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 4, 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the 3-stars. 

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph step-by-step:

1. Start by identifying the central nodes (nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes).

    - Node 0, node 3, node 6, and node 8 are central nodes as they are connected to exactly three other nodes each.

2. For each central node, identify the other nodes that are connected to it. These will be the leaves of the 3-star.

    - Node 0 has leaves 1, 5, and 7
    - Node 3 has leaves 5, 7, and 9
    - Node 6 has leaves 7, 8, and 9
    - Node 8 has leaves 0, 5, and 6

Combining these, we can see the unique 3-stars present in the graph:

<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<3, (5, 7, 9)>
<6, (7, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 5, 6)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars identified, we get a total of [4].
