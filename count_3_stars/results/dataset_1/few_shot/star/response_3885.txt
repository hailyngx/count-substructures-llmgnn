Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star-like pattern. 

Here are the unique 3-stars in the given graph: 
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<0, (1, 6, 8)>
<1, (0, 4, 5)>
<2, (0, 3, 7)>
<3, (0, 2, 7)>
<4, (1, 5, 6)>
<5, (1, 4, 9)>
<6, (0, 4, 9)>
<7, (2, 3, 9)>

Count of 3-stars: [9]
