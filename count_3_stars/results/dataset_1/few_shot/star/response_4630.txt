Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars present in the graph:

<0, (2, 6, 7)>
<1, (2, 5, 8)>
<2, (0, 1, 9)>
<3, (5, 6, 9)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph.
