Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (8, 3) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 3

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that serves as the center of a 3-star. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

In this graph:
- Node 1 is connected to node 7.
- Node 2 is connected to node 3.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 8, and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 3 and 6.
- Node 5 is connected to node 6.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 4 and 5.
- Node 7 is connected to node 1.
- Node 8 is connected to node 3.
- Node 9 is connected to node 3.

By examining the adjacency list, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:

<2, (3, 4, 8)>
<2, (3, 4, 9)>
<3, (4, 6, 8)>
<3, (4, 6, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: <2, (3, 4, 8)>, <2, (3, 4, 9)>, <3, (4, 6, 8)>, <3, (4, 6, 9)>.
