Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 7) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we will look for each node that has exactly three neighbors and then determine if those neighbors form a 3-star around that node.

Let's go through the nodes:
1. Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 1, 5, 6
   - <0, (1, 5, 6)>
   
2. Node 1 has 4 neighbors, which is more than 3, so it does not form a 3-star.
   
3. Node 2 has 1 neighbor, which is not enough to form a 3-star.
   
4. Node 3 has 1 neighbor, which is not enough.
   
5. Node 4 has 2 neighbors, not enough.
   
6. Node 5 has 1 neighbor, not enough.
   
7. Node 6 has 2 neighbors, not enough.
   
8. Node 7 has 2 neighbors, not enough.
   
9. Node 8 has 1 neighbor, not enough.
   
10. Node 9 has 4 neighbors, which is more than 3, so it does not form a 3-star.

Therefore, the only 3-star in this graph is: [<0, (1, 5, 6)>]
