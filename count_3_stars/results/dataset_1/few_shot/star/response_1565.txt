Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 9) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern with that node as the center.

Looking at the provided graph, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (1, 4, 9)>
<1, (0, 2, 8)>
<2, (1, 3, 9)>
<3, (2, 4, 5)>
<4, (0, 3, 5)>
<5, (1, 3, 8)>
<6, (9)>
<7, (8, 9)>
<8, (1, 5, 7)>
<9, (0, 2, 3)>

Counting all unique 3-stars, we find a total of [9] unique 3-star patterns in the given graph.
