Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Looking at the given graph and adjacency list:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 5, and 6: <0, (1, 5, 6)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 2, and 6: <1, (0, 2, 6)>
- Node 2 does not form a 3-star since it is not connected to exactly three other nodes.
- Node 3 does not form a 3-star since it is not connected to exactly three other nodes.
- Node 4 does not form a 3-star since it is not the central node of any 3-star.
- Node 5 does not form a 3-star since it is not the central node of any 3-star.
- Node 6 does not form a 3-star since it is not connected to exactly three other nodes.
- Node 7 does not form a 3-star since it is not the central node of any 3-star.
- Node 8 does not form a 3-star since it is not the central node of any 3-star.
- Node 9 does not form a 3-star since it is not the central node of any 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2]. The unique 3-stars found are <0, (1, 5, 6)> and <1, (0, 2, 6)>.
