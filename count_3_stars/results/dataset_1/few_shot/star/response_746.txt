Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3
