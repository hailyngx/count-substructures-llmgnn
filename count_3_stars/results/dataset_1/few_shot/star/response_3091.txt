Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 9) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 9
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 1

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].

<0, (3, 4, 6)>
