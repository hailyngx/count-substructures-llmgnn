Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 1) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes (forming a 3-star pattern). Let's go through the adjacency list and find all the 3-stars:

1. Start with Node 0:
    - Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 6, and 9.
    - Possible 3-stars involving Node 0:
        - <0, (1, 2, 3)>
        - <0, (1, 3, 6)>
        - <0, (1, 2, 9)>
    - Total 3-stars involving Node 0: 3

2. Move on to Node 1:
    - Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 5, 7, and 8.
    - Possible 3-stars involving Node 1:
        - <1, (0, 5, 7)>
        - <1, (0, 5, 8)>
    - Total 3-stars involving Node 1: 2

3. Continue this process for Nodes 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.

After examining all nodes, we find the following unique 3-stars:
- <0, (1, 2, 3)>
- <0, (1, 3, 6)>
- <0, (1, 2, 9)>
- <1, (0, 5, 7)>
- <1, (0, 5, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
