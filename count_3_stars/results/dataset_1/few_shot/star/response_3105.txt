Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 6

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. The node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 4, and 6: <2, (3, 4, 6)>
2. The node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 2, and 7: <3, (0, 2, 7)>
3. The node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 4, and 7: <5, (1, 4, 7)>
4. The node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 8, and 9: <6, (2, 8, 9)>

Count of 3-stars: [4]
