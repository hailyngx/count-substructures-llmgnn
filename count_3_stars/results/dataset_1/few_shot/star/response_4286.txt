Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 8

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for the patterns where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<1, (0, 5, 8)>
<2, (4, 9, 3)>
<4, (1, 2, 6)>
<5, (1, 9, 0)>
<6, (0, 4, 7)>
<9, (8, 2, 5)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we get: [7].
