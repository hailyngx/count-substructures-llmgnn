Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 8) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 5

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node has exactly three neighbors. These instances represent possible 3-star structures in the graph. 

Looking at the adjacency list provided, we can see that nodes 0, 3, and 1 do not form any 3-star structures since they do not have exactly three neighbors. We are left with nodes 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 as potential center nodes for 3-stars. Let's analyze each of these nodes to find the 3-stars:

1. Node 2: Node 2 has 2 neighbors (0, 7) which do not form a 3-star.

2. Node 4: Node 4 has 2 neighbors (8, 9) which do not form a 3-star.

3. Node 5: Node 5 has 3 neighbors (6, 8, 9) forming a 3-star. 
   <5, (6, 8, 9)>

4. Node 6: Node 6 has 2 neighbors (5, 7) which do not form a 3-star.

5. Node 7: Node 7 has 2 neighbors (2, 6) which do not form a 3-star.

6. Node 8: Node 8 has 4 neighbors (1, 3, 4, 5) which do not form a 3-star.

7. Node 9: Node 9 has 2 neighbors (4, 5) which do not form a 3-star.

Therefore, there is only one unique 3-star in the given graph. 
The final answer is [1].
