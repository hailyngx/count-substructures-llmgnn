Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all the unique sets of 3 nodes where one node is connected to the other two nodes. 

1. Identify the nodes which have exactly 3 edges connected to them, since they could be potential central nodes of 3-stars:
   - Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, and 8 have 3 edges each.
   
2. For each of these nodes, check if the connected nodes form a 3-star configuration:
   
   For example, for Node 0:
   - Check the neighbors of Node 0 (nodes 2, 4, 5, 7).
   - Check if any of these sets form a 3-star configuration: (0, 2, 4), (0, 2, 5), (0, 2, 7), (0, 4, 5), (0, 4, 7), and (0, 5, 7).
   
   Repeat this process for Nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, and 8.

3. Count the total number of unique 3-stars identified.

Doing this step by step:
- For Node 0: <0, (2, 4, 5)>, <0, (2, 5, 7)>, <0, (4, 5, 7)> [3]
- For Node 1: <1, (5, 7, 8)> [1]
- For Node 2: <2, (0, 7, 8)>, <2, (7, 8, 5)> [2]
- For Node 3: No 3-star configuration
- For Node 4: No 3-star configuration
- For Node 7: <7, (0, 1, 2)>, <7, (0, 1, 5)> [2]
- For Node 8: No 3-star configuration

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
