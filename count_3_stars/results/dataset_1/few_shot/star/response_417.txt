Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 5, and node 8

Response:
The nodes involved in 3-stars are: 1, 2, 5, 8, 9.

Let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph.

There are a total of 5 possible central nodes for the 3-stars (1, 2, 5, 8, 9).

For each central node, we check if it is connected to exactly 3 other nodes, forming a 3-star.

1. For central node 1: (1, 2, 7, 8) --> Not a 3-star.
2. For central node 2: (2, 1, 3, 6, 7, 8) --> Not a 3-star.
3. For central node 5: (5, 3, 9) --> This forms a 3-star.
4. For central node 8: (8, 1, 2, 9) --> This forms a 3-star.
5. For central node 9: (9, 5, 8) --> This forms a 3-star.

So, there are 3 unique 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [3].

Unique 3-stars:
<5, (3, 9)>
<8, (1, 2, 9)>
<9, (5, 8)>
