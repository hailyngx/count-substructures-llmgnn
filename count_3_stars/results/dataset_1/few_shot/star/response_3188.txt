Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 8
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 7

Response:
Given the information provided, we will look for 3-star subgraphs in this graph.

Let's go through each node and its connections to find the 3-stars:
- Node 1: (2, 7, 8)
- Node 2: (1, 4, 5), (1, 5, 8), (1, 2, 8)
- Node 4: (2, 5, _)
- Node 5: (2, 4, _), (2, 1, _), (2, 8, _)
- Node 7: (1, 9, _)
- Node 8: (1, 2, 5)
- Node 9: (7, 1, _)

Count the total number of 3-stars: [7]

List of unique 3-stars:
<1, (2, 7, 8)>
<2, (1, 4, 5)>
<2, (1, 5, 8)>
<2, (1, 2, 8)>
<4, (2, 5, _)>
<5, (2, 4, _)>
<5, (2, 8, _)>

Therefore, the final answer is [7].
