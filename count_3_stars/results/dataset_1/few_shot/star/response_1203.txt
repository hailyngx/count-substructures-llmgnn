Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 9
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify sets of nodes where one node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a star shape. 

Looking at the graph and the adjacency list, we can see that node 0, node 1, and node 7 are the only nodes with three connections each, making them potential central nodes for 3-stars.

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- The possible 3-star centered at node 0: <0, (1, 3, 5)>
- The possible 3-star centered at node 1: <1, (0, 7)>
- The possible 3-star centered at node 7: <7, (1, 2, 9)>

Counting the number of 3-stars: [3]

Unique 3-stars found:
<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<1, (0, 7)>
<7, (1, 2, 9)>
