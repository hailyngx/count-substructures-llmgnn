Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern. 

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph along with their central node and connected leaf nodes:

<0, (1, 4, 8)>
<4, (0, 7, 8)>
<8, (0, 5, 6)>
<5, (8, 9, -)>
<9, (2, 5, -)>

Thus, there are a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
