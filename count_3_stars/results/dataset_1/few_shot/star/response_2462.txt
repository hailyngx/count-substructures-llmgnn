Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 2

Response:
There are <0, (3, 7, 5)> and <2, (3, 8, 9)> 3-stars in this graph. 
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [2].
