Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's go step by step:

1. Identify all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
   - Node 0: Connected to nodes 1, 6, and 7
   - Node 3: Connected to nodes 4 and 5
   - Node 7: Connected to nodes 0, 4, and 6
   - Node 8: Connected to node 4

2. For each of the identified nodes, check if they form a 3-star with their connected nodes:
   - Node 0 forms a 3-star: <0, (1, 6, 7)>
   - Node 3 forms a 3-star: <3, (4, 5, 6)>
   - Node 7 forms a 3-star: <7, (0, 4, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3]. 

<0, (1, 6, 7)> <3, (4, 5, 6)> <7, (0, 4, 6)>
