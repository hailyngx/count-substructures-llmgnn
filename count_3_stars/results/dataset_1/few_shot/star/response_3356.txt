Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 3

Response:
Following the definition of a 3-star graph, we look for nodes that have exactly three neighbors. In this case, nodes 1, 3, and 6 satisfy this condition. Let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph.

[]
Unique 3-stars:
<1, (3, 4, 7)>
<3, (1, 6, 9)>
<6, (2, 3, 7)>
<6, (5, 7, 8)>
