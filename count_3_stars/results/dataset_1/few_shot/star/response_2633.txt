Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. These instances will represent 3-stars.

In this graph, the nodes and their connections are as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 5
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0 and 7
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 5, and 8
- Node 3 is connected to node 4
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 6
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 7, and 9
- Node 6 is connected to node 4
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 8
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 2 and 7
- Node 9 is connected to node 5

Let's list the 3-stars in this graph:
<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<2, (0, 4, 5)>
<4, (2, 3, 6)>
<5, (0, 2, 7)>
<7, (1, 5, 8)>

There are a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
