Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 5, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly 3 other nodes forming a 3-star configuration. 

Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0: (2, 8, 9)
- Node 1: (8, 9)
- Node 2: (0, 3, 8)
- Node 3: (2, 5, 8)
- Node 4: (6, 8, 9)
- Node 5: (3, 9)
- Node 6: (4, 7)
- Node 7: (2, 6)
- Node 8: (0, 1, 2) and (3, 4, 9)
- Node 9: (0, 1, 4) and (5, 8)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [11].

Unique 3-stars: 
<0, (2, 8, 9)>
<1, (8, 9)>
<2, (0, 3, 8)>
<3, (2, 5, 8)>
<4, (6, 8, 9)>
<5, (3, 9)>
<6, (4, 7)>
<7, (2, 6)>
<8, (0, 1, 2)>
<8, (3, 4, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 4)>
