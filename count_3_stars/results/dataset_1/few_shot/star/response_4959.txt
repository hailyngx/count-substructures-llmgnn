Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8

Response:
The 3-star graph is a very specific substructure, given that it has a center node with exactly three leaves connected to it. To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to find all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes and meet the 3-star criteria.

Let's go through each node to identify the 3-stars:

1. Node 0:
   - Neighbors: 1, 2, 3
   - <0, (1, 2, 3)>

2. Node 1:
   - Neighbors: 0, 8, 9
   - <1, (0, 8, 9)>

3. Node 2:
   - Neighbors: 0, 3, 4, 5, 8
   - <2, (0, 4, 5)> since (2, 8) is not a 3-star
   
4. Node 3:
   - Neighbors: 0, 2, 6, 9
   - No 3-star
   
5. Node 4:
   - Neighbors: 2, 5
   - No 3-star
   
6. Node 5:
   - Neighbors: 2, 4, 6
   - No 3-star
   
7. Node 6:
   - Neighbors: 3, 5, 7
   - No 3-star
   
8. Node 7:
   - Neighbors: 6
   - No 3-star
   
9. Node 8:
   - Neighbors: 1, 2, 9
   - <8, (1, 2, 9)>
   
10. Node 9:
    - Neighbors: 1, 3, 8
    - <9, (1, 3, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4]. 
The unique 3-stars are: <0, (1, 2, 3)>, <1, (0, 8, 9)>, <2, (0, 4, 5)>, <8, (1, 2, 9)>.
