Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in the graph.

Here are the unique 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (3, 4, 8)>
<1, (2, 5, 6)>
<3, (0, 5, 7)>
<4, (0, 5, 8)>
<5, (1, 2, 3)>
<7, (3, 5, 6)>
<8, (0, 5, 7)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
