Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Based on the provided information, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:

<1, (2, 7, 8)>
<4, (3, 6, 8)>
<7, (5, 9, 1)>
<8, (9, 1, 4)>
<9, (6, 7, 8)>

There are a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
