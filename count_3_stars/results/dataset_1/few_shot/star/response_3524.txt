Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, let's first identify all the 3-stars present. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we can see that the possible 3-stars can be formed with the central node having exactly 3 neighboring nodes. Let's list them below:
<1, (2, 3, 5)>
<3, (1, 2, 7)>
<5, (1, 4, 7)>
<7, (1, 3, 4)>
<8, (3, 5, 7)>

Now, we count the total number of unique 3-stars listed above: [5].
