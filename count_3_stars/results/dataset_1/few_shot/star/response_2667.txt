Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 7

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 8 is a part of the following 3-stars:
<8, (0, 1, 2)> - 1st star
<8, (1, 2, 3)> - 2nd star
<8, (2, 3, 6)> - 3rd star
<8, (3, 6, 7)> - 4th star
<8, (6, 7, 1)> - 5th star

2. Node 2 is a part of the following 3-stars:
<2, (6, 8, 9)> - 6th star

3. Node 3 is a part of the following 3-stars:
<3, (6, 7, 8)> - 7th star
<3, (7, 8, 9)> - 8th star

4. Node 6 is a part of the following 3-stars:
<6, (1, 2, 3)> - 9th star
<6, (2, 3, 8)> - 10th star
<6, (3, 1, 7)> - 11th star

5. Node 1 is a part of the following 3-star:
<1, (2, 3, 8)> - 12th star

6. Node 7 is a part of the following 3-star:
<7, (3, 8, 9)> - 13th star

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [13].
