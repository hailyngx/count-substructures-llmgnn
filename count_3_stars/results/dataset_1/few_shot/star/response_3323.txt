Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes. These instances represent 3-stars with that node being the center. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (1, 2, 6)>
<1, (0, 2, 4)>
<2, (0, 1, 4)>
<4, (1, 2, 7)>
<5, (6, 7, 8)>
<6, (0, 5, 8)>
<7, (4, 5, 8)>
<8, (5, 6, 7)>
<9, (1, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].  
The unique 3-stars are: <0, (1, 2, 6)>, <1, (0, 2, 4)>, <2, (0, 1, 4)>, <4, (1, 2, 7)>, <5, (6, 7, 8)>, <6, (0, 5, 8)>, <7, (4, 5, 8)>, <8, (5, 6, 7)>, <9, (1, 6)>.
