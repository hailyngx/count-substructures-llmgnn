Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 5, and node 7
