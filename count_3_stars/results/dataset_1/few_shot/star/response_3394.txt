Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 5, and node 8

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will look for each node that is connected to exactly 3 other nodes, forming a 3-star. We will then count all such unique 3-stars present in the graph.

In this graph, the nodes that form 3-stars are:
- Node 1: (1, 2, 4, 7)
- Node 7: (7, 1, 4, 6)

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].

Unique 3-stars:
<1, (2, 4, 7)>
<7, (1, 4, 6)>
