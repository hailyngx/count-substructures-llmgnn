Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 6

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star configurations in the given graph:
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 5, and 7 (since it is connected to nodes 0, 5, and 7).
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 4, and 6 (since it is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 6).
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 4, and 6 (since it is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 6).

Now, let's count the total number of such 3-stars in the graph inside brackets []:
[3]

And list the unique 3-stars found inside <> each only once:
<4, (0, 5, 7)>
<5, (0, 4, 6)>
<9, (3, 4, 6)>
