Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list the 3-stars found in the graph: 
<0, (8, 5, 5)>
<3, (5, 7, 7)>
<5, (3, 7, 8)>
<7, (3, 4, 5)>
<8, (0, 5, 5)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we get a total of [5].
