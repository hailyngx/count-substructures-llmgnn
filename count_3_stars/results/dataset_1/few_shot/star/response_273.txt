Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the 3-stars. 

Starting with Node 0:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 6, and 7. Therefore, it can form 3-stars with nodes 2, 6, and 7.

Starting with Node 1:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 5, 6, and 8.
  - Node 1, with nodes 2 and 5, forms a 3-star. (1, (2, 5, _))
  - Node 1, with nodes 4 and 6, forms a 3-star. (1, (4, 6, _))

Starting with Node 2:
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 5. Therefore, it can form 3-stars with any two of these nodes.

Starting with Node 3:
- Node 3 is connected to only Node 5. Therefore, it cannot form any 3-stars.

Starting with Node 4:
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 6, and 7. Therefore, it can form 3-stars with these nodes.

Starting with Node 5:
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, and 7.
  - Node 5, with nodes 1 and 7, forms a 3-star. (5, (1, 7, _))

Starting with Node 6:
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, and 8. Therefore, it can form 3-stars with any three of these nodes.

Starting with Node 7:
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 5, and 9.
  - Node 7, with nodes 0 and 4, forms a 3-star. (7, (0, 4, _))
  - Node 7, with nodes 0 and 5, forms a 3-star. (7, (0, 5, _))
  - Node 7, with nodes 4 and 5, forms a 3-star. (7, (4, 5, _))

Starting with Node 8:
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1 and 6. Therefore, it can form a 3-star with these nodes.

Starting with Node 9:
- Node 9 is connected to only Node 7. Therefore, it cannot form any 3-stars.

Count of unique 3-stars: [4]

Unique 3-stars:
<1, (2, 5, _)>
<1, (4, 6, _)>
<7, (0, 4, _)>
<7, (0, 5, _)>
