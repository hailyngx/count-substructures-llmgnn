Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for each node that has exactly 3 neighbors connected to it. These nodes will serve as the centers of the 3-stars.

Examining the given graph's adjacency list for each node, we find that the nodes with exactly 3 neighbors are node 0, node 2, and node 6. Each of these nodes can be the center of a 3-star.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is simply the count of these three potential center nodes, which is [3].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<2, (1, 6, 7)>
<6, (0, 2, 3)>.
