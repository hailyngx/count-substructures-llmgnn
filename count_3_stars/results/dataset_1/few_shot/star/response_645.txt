Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star pattern, which consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Based on the provided information, the possible 3-star patterns in the graph are as follows:
<0, (4, 6, 9)>
<2, (4, 5, 8)>
<3, (5, 7, 9)>
<4, (0, 2, 8)>
<5, (2, 3, 9)>
<7, (3, 4, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
