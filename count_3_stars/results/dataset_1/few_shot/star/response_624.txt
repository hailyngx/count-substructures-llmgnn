Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 8
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, and node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Upon examining the adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (4, 9)>
<1, (3, 7, 9)>
<2, (3, 5, 7)>
<3, (1, 2, 5)>
<4, (0, 9)>
<5, (2, 3, 8)>
<7, (1, 2, 3)>
<9, (0, 1, 2)>

There are a total of 8 unique 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
