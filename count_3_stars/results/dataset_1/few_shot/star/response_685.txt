Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to first identify all the unique 3-stars. 

Looking at the provided graph and adjacency information, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<1, (0, 6, 2)>
<2, (6, 9, 8)>
<3, (5, 6, -)>
<4, (7, 9, -)>
<5, (0, 3, 9)>
<6, (1, 2, 3)>
<7, (0, 4, -)>
<9, (2, 4, 5)>

Now we count the total number of unique 3-stars, which is [9].
