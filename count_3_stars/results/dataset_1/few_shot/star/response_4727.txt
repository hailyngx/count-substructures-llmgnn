Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, also known as the number of 4-cliques (complete subgraphs on 4 nodes), we need to look for each instance where a node forms a 3-star with three other nodes.

Based on the adjacency list provided, we can identify the 3-stars present in the graph. Let's list them first:

<0, (3, 6, 8)>
<0, (3, 6, 9)>
<0, (3, 8, 9)>
<1, (5, 7, 8)>
<1, (5, 7, 9)>
<1, (5, 8, 9)>
<2, (4, 7, 8)>
<2, (4, 7, 9)>
<2, (4, 8, 9)>
<3, (4, 5, 8)>
<3, (4, 5, 9)>
<4, (6, 8, 9)>
<8, (6, 9, 0)>
<8, (6, 9, 1)>
<8, (6, 9, 3)>
<9, (0, 1, 3)>
<9, (0, 3, 6)>
<9, (3, 6, 8)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we find a total of [17] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
