Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2

Response:
Let's find the 3-star graphs in the given graph:

- Central Node: 0, Leaves: 1, 2, 3
- Central Node: 0, Leaves: 4, 6, 8
- Central Node: 1, Leaves: 0, 2, 5
- Central Node: 2, Leaves: 0, 1, 3
- Central Node: 3, Leaves: 0, 2, 4
- Central Node: 4, Leaves: 0, 3, 5
- Central Node: 6, Leaves: 0, 4, 7
- Central Node: 8, Leaves: 0, 2, 7

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8]. 

<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<0, (4, 6, 8)>
<1, (0, 2, 5)>
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<3, (0, 2, 4)>
<4, (0, 3, 5)>
<6, (0, 4, 7)>
<8, (0, 2, 7)>
