Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 7

Response:
At first glance, nodes 0, 1, and 5 form 3-stars with their adjacent nodes. Let's find all the 3-stars in this graph.

We have:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 5, 7.
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 3, 4.
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, 2 and another 3-star with nodes 3, 4.

Therefore, we have found all unique 3-stars in the given graph:
<0, (1, 5, 7)>, <1, (0, 3, 4)>, <5, (0, 1, 2)>, <5, (3, 4)>.

Counting these 3-stars, we have a total of [4] 3-stars in the graph.
