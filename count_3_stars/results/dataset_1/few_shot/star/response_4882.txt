Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 1

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are part of a 3-star graph:

- Node 0: Forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 7, and 9
- Node 1: Forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 7, and 9
- Node 7: Forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, and 3
- Node 8: Forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 2, and 6

Now we can count the number of unique 3-stars in the graph.
