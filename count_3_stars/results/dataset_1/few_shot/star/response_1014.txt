Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 4, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern.

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

Node 0 forms 2 3-stars: <0, (1, 3, 5)> and <0, (1, 3, 6)>
Node 1 forms 1 3-star: <1, (0, 3, 7)>
Node 3 forms 2 3-stars: <3, (0, 1, 5)> and <3, (0, 1, 7)>
Node 5 forms 1 3-star: <5, (0, 2, 7)>
Node 6 forms 1 3-star: <6, (0, 4, 7)>
Node 9 forms 1 3-star: <9, (0, 2, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
