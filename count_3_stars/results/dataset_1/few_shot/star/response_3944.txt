Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 9
