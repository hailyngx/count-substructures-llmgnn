Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 5
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 5, and node 6

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. From the adjacency list, we can see that each node must be the central node of at most one 3-star. 
2. To form a 3-star, the central node must be connected to exactly three other nodes. 
3. We will iterate through each node and check if it satisfies the condition of a central node in a 3-star.

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (5, 7, 9)>
<1, (2, 3, 4)>
<3, (1, 7, 9)>
<5, (0, 2, 7)>
<7, (0, 3, 5)>
<9, (0, 4, 6)>

Count of 3-stars: [6]
