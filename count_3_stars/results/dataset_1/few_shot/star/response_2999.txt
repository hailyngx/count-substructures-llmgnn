Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to understand the definition of a 3-star graph. A 3-star graph consists of a central node (the center) that is connected to exactly three other nodes (leaves) by edges. 

Given the information provided, the nodes in this graph are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.

The 3-stars in this graph can be identified by looking for nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them and analyzing their neighbors. Let's identify the 3-stars step by step:

1. Node 0 is a potential center for 3-stars because it has 4 edges: (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 5), and (0, 6).
   - Potential 3-star with Node 0 as the center and its neighbors as leaves: <0, (2, 4, 5)> and <0, (2, 5, 6)>

2. Node 2 is a potential center for 3-stars because it has 4 edges: (2, 0), (2, 4), (2, 6), and (2, 7).
   - Potential 3-star with Node 2 as the center and its neighbors as leaves: <2, (0, 4, 6)> and <2, (0, 6, 7)>

3. Node 6 is a potential center for 3-stars because it has 5 edges: (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 5), and (6, 7).
   - Potential 3-star with Node 6 as the center and its neighbors as leaves: <6, (0, 1, 2)> and <6, (0, 2, 5)> and <6, (2, 5, 7)>

The unique 3-stars in this graph are: <0, (2, 4, 5)>, <0, (2, 5, 6)>, <2, (0, 4, 6)>, <2, (0, 6, 7)>, <6, (0, 1, 2)>, <6, (0, 2, 5)>, and <6, (2, 5, 7)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
