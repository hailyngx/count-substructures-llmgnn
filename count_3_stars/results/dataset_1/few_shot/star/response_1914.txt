Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 5
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 5

Response:
The central node of a 3-star can be any node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through each node to identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 0 does not form a 3-star because it is only connected to 1 other node.
- Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (5, 8, 9)>
- Node 2 forms two 3-stars: <2, (0, 3, 4)> and <2, (3, 4, 0)>
- Node 3 does not form a 3-star because it is only connected to 1 other node.
- Node 4 does not form a 3-star because it is only connected to 1 other node.
- Node 5 forms two 3-stars: <5, (1, 6, 9)> and <5, (6, 9, 1)>
- Node 6 does not form a 3-star because it is only connected to 1 other node.
- Node 7 does not form a 3-star because it is not connected to any other nodes.
- Node 8 does not form a 3-star because it is only connected to 1 other node.
- Node 9 does not form a 3-star because it is connected to more than 3 nodes.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
