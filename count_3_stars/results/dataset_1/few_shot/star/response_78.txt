Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 8

Response:
Based on the given information, we can identify the 3-star structures in the graph:

<0, (1, 3, 7)>
<0, (3, 2, 9)>
<0, (7, 1, 9)>
<0, (9, 5, 8)>
<3, (0, 2, 4)>
<3, (2, 0, 8)>
<3, (4, 6, 8)>
<3, (8, 0, 9)>
<4, (3, 6, 8)>
<7, (0, 1, 5)>
<7, (1, 0, 6)>
<7, (5, 0, 6)>
<7, (6, 4, 0)>
<9, (0, 5, 8)>
<9, (5, 7, 8)>
<9, (8, 3, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [16].
