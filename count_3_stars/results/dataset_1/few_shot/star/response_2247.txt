Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a 3-star pattern.

Based on the given adjacency list and edges, we can identify the following 3-stars in the graph:
1. <0, (2, 5, 8)>
2. <0, (2, 8, 5)>
3. <1, (2, 7, 8)>
4. <1, (7, 8, 2)>
5. <2, (0, 1, 8)>
6. <2, (0, 8, 1)>
7. <2, (1, 8, 0)>
8. <5, (0, 2, 8)>
9. <5, (2, 8, 0)>
10. <7, (1, 8, 9)>
11. <7, (8, 9, 1)>
12. <8, (0, 1, 2)>
13. <8, (0, 2, 1)>
14. <8, (1, 2, 0)>
15. <8, (3, 4, 6)>
16. <8, (4, 6, 3)>
17. <8, (6, 3, 4)>
18. <8, (7, 9, 1)>
19. <8, (9, 1, 7)>
20. <8, (9, 7, 1)>
21. <9, (2, 7, 8)>
22. <9, (7, 8, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [22].
