Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 5
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the 3-stars. A 3-star graph consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the provided information:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 4 and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 5.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 5, and 7.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, and 6.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 5 and 7.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 4 and 6.
- Node 8 is connected to node 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 8.

Let's find all the 3-stars in the given graph step-by-step:

1. For Node 0:
   - <0, (4, 9)>

2. For Node 1:
   - <1, (2, 5, 9)>
   - <1, (5, 2, 9)>

3. For Node 2:
   - <2, (1, 4, 5)>
   - <2, (5, 1, 4)>

4. For Node 4:
   - <4, (0, 2, 5)>
   - <4, (2, 0, 5)>
   - <4, (5, 0, 2)>
   - <4, (5, 2, 0)>

5. For Node 5:
   - <5, (1, 2, 4)>
   - <5, (2, 1, 4)>
   - <5, (4, 1, 2)>
   - <5, (4, 2, 1)>

Now, count the total number of 3-stars found: [8]
