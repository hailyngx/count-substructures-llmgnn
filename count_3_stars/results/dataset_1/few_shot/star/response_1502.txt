Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 8

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 2, and 7: <0, (1, 2, 7)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 2, and 5: <1, (0, 2, 5)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, and 6: <2, (0, 1, 6)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 2, and 9: <6, (1, 2, 9)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 4, and 9: <7, (0, 4, 9)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 7, and 8: <9, (6, 7, 8)>

Count of 3-stars: [6]
