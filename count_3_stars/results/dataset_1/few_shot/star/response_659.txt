Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 0 forms a 3-star: <0, (2, 4, 5)>
2. Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (8, 9, -)>
3. Node 4 forms two 3-stars: <4, (0, 5, 7)> and <4, (5, 7, 9)>
4. Node 5 forms one 3-star: <5, (0, 4, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
