Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 5
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes, forming a star shape with the central node and three leaves. 

Based on the given information, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (5, 6, 8)>
<5, (0, 3, 6)>
<8, (2, 5, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
