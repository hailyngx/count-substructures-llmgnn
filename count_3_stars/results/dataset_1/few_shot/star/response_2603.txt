Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 4, 7, and node 8

Response:
The number of 3-stars can be calculated by counting the number of triangles in the graph. A 3-star corresponds to a specific type of triangle where one vertex has degree 2 and the other two vertices have degree 1.

Observing the graph information provided, we can identify the following unique 3-stars:
<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<1, (8, 9, -)>
<2, (4, 6, 7)>
<3, (0, 6, -)>
<4, (0, 2, 9)>
<9, (1, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
