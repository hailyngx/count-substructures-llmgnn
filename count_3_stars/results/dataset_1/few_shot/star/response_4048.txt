Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will look for each node that is at the center of a 3-star. A 3-star consists of a center node and three other nodes connected to the center.

Looking at the given information, we find the following 3-stars:
<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<1, (0, 5, 9)>
<2, (0, 6, 7)>
<4, (5, 6, 7)>
<7, (2, 3, 9)>
<9, (1, 2, 8)>

Count of 3-stars: [6]
