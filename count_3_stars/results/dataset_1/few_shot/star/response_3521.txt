Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 5, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Looking at the adjacency list, we notice that only nodes 0, 4, and 5 are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes can act as the center of a 3-star.

For node 0:
- <0, (1, 5, 8)>
- <0, (1, 4, 9)>
- <0, (4, 8, 9)>
- <0, (5, 9, 1)>

For node 4:
- <4, (0, 8, 9)>
- <4, (0, 7, 9)>
- <4, (7, 8, 9)>
- <4, (8, 9, 0)>

For node 5:
- <5, (0, 6, 9)>
- <5, (0, 2, 9)>
- <5, (2, 6, 9)>
- <5, (6, 9, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12], as there are 12 unique 3-stars present. 
The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 5, 8)>, <0, (1, 4, 9)>, <0, (4, 8, 9)>, <0, (5, 9, 1)>, <4, (0, 8, 9)>, <4, (0, 7, 9)>, <4, (7, 8, 9)>, <4, (8, 9, 0)>, <5, (0, 6, 9)>, <5, (0, 2, 9)>, <5, (2, 6, 9)>, <5, (6, 9, 0)>.
