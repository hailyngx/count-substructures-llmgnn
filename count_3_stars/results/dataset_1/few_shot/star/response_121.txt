Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 7

Response:
The 3-star structures in the given graph are as follows:
<0, (1, 9)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<1, (0, 6, 7)>
<1, (0, 7, 9)>
<1, (3, 4, 6)>
<1, (3, 7, 9)>
<1, (4, 6, 8)>
<1, (4, 7, 9)>
<1, (6, 7, 9)>
<4, (1, 3, 8)>
<4, (1, 6, 8)>
<4, (3, 6, 8)>
<6, (1, 7, 8)>
<7, (1, 6, 9)>

Count of 3-star structures: [15]
