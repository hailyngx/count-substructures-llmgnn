Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 6) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 7

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are as follows:
<0, (1, 6, 8)>
<0, (1, 8, 9)>
<1, (0, 4, 9)>
<1, (4, 5, 7)>
<4, (1, 5, 7)>
<5, (3, 4, 8)>
<5, (4, 8, 9)>
<5, (8, 9, 7)>
