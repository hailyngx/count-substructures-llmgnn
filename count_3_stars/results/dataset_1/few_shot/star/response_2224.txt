Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all combinations of three nodes where one node is connected to the other two nodes but the two nodes are not directly connected. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we can see that nodes 0, 3, 4, 6, and 8 are all connected to exactly 3 other nodes. These nodes can act as the center nodes of the 3-stars. Let's list all the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (5, 6, 7)>
<3, (2, 4, 8)>
<3, (6, 8, 9)>
<4, (5, 9, 3)>
<6, (1, 3, 8)>
<6, (0, 3, 8)>
<6, (3, 8, 9)>
<8, (4, 5, 9)>
<8, (3, 5, 6)>
<8, (5, 6, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
