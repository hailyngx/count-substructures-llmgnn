Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all unique 3-stars. Let's start by listing all the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (2, 3, 5)>
<1, (3, 4, 9)>
<3, (0, 1, 4)>
<4, (1, 3, 5)>
<5, (0, 4, 7)>
<6, (3, 4, 9)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we find a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
