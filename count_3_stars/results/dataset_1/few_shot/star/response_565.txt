Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars present in the graph.

Based on the definition of a 3-star, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Looking at the given adjacency list and edge list, we can identify the following 3-stars:
1. <0, (7, 9)>
2. <1, (3, 2, 6)>
3. <4, (2, 9, 3)>
4. <5, (6, 3, 9)>
5. <8, (7, 2, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
