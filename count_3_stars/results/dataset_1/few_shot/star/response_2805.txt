Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 5
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern.

Examining the information provided, we can see that nodes 0, 3, and 5 are the only nodes connected to exactly three other nodes. Therefore, these are the central nodes of potential 3-stars.

Now let's list the unique 3-stars present in the graph:
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<0, (2, 3, 5)>
<3, (0, 5, 7)>
<3, (2, 5, 9)>
<5, (0, 3, 4)>
<5, (0, 3, 7)>
<5, (3, 7, 9)>

Count of 3-stars: [8]
