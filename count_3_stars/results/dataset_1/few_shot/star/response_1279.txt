Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 1) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 6) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 2

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star in the graph. Remember, a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list the 3-stars in the graph: 
<1, (2, 4, 7)>
<6, (0, 1, 7)>

Count of 3-stars: [2]
