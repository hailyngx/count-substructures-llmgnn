Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 4, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (3, 5, 9)>
<1, (3, 6, 9)>
<2, (3, 7, 9)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<4, (3, 7, 8)>
<5, (0, 7, 8)>
<6, (1, 9, 0)>
<7, (2, 4, 5)>
<8, (3, 5, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
