Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 6

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are:

<0, (5, 6, 9)>
<1, (3, 6, 7)>
<2, (3, 5, 8)>
<3, (1, 2, 7)>
<4, (8, 9, 5)>
<5, (0, 2, 3)>
<6, (0, 1, 5)>
<7, (1, 3, 5)>
<8, (2, 4, 9)>
<9, (4, 5, 6)>
