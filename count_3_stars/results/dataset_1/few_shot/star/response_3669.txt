Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 8) (4, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 4, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the 3-star structures. 
A 3-star consists of one central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the adjacency list provided, we can identify the 3-star structures and count the total number of 3-stars in the graph. Here are the 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<1, (0, 2, 6)>
<3, (7, 8, 9)>
<4, (8, 9)>
<8, (1, 3, 4)>
<9, (1, 2, 3)>
