Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern.

Based on the definition of a 3-star graph, we are looking for instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Going through the adjacency list and the edges provided, we can identify the following 3-stars:
1. <1, (2, 3, 9)>
2. <2, (1, 3, 6)>
3. <3, (2, 6, 9)>
4. <4, (6, 8, 9)>
5. <5, (4, 7, 8)>
6. <6, (2, 3, 4)>
7. <7, (0, 5, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
