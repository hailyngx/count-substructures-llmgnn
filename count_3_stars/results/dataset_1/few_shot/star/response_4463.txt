Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 8

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 

Based on the definition of a 3-star graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the given graph, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<1, (2, 4, 9)>
<2, (1, 8, 9)>
<4, (1, 6, 7)>
<6, (4, 7, 8)>
<8, (2, 6, 9)>

Since these are all the unique 3-stars in the graph, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5]. 

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
