Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 6

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- From node 0: <0, (7, 9)>
- From node 3: <3, (4, 6, 7)>
- From node 4: <4, (3, 7, 8)>
- From node 7: <7, (0, 3, 5)> and <7, (4, 5, 8)>
- From node 9: <9, (0, 6, -)> (as there is no 3rd connection specified)

Therefore, there are a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
