Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 6

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star configurations in the given graph:

 <0, (4, 5, 6)>
 <1, (5, 6, 9)>
 <3, (5, 6, 8)>
 <5, (1, 4, 8)>
 <6, (0, 1, 4)>
 <6, (0, 4, 8)>
 
Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph: [6].
