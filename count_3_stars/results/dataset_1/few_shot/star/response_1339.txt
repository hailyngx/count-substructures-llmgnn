Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (4, 2) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 2
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can first identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will serve as the center of the 3-star. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we can identify that nodes 1, 2, 6, 7, and 9 are each connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Now, let's list the 3-stars in the graph:
<1, (6, 9)>
<2, (4, 7)>
<6, (1, 8)>
<7, (2, 9)>
<9, (1, 7)>

Counting the total number of unique 3-stars, we get a final answer:
[5]
