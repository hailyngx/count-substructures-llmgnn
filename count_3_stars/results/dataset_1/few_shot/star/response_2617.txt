Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can analyze each node to see if it serves as the central node of a 3-star. 

Looking at the adjacency list for each node:
- Node 0: Forms 1 three-star <0, (7, 8, 9)>
- Node 1: Forms 1 three-star <1, (3, 4, 5)>
- Node 2: Does not form a 3-star
- Node 3: Forms 2 three-stars <3, (1, 2, 4)> and <3, (1, 4, 2)>
- Node 4: Forms 2 three-stars <4, (1, 2, 3)> and <4, (1, 3, 2)>
- Node 5: Forms 1 three-star <5, (1, 6, 7)>
- Node 6: Does not form a 3-star
- Node 7: Forms 1 three-star <7, (0, 5, 9)>
- Node 8: Does not form a 3-star
- Node 9: Does not form a 3-star

Count of 3-stars: [6]

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (7, 8, 9)>
<1, (3, 4, 5)>
<3, (1, 2, 4)>
<3, (1, 4, 2)>
<4, (1, 2, 3)>
<4, (1, 3, 2)>
