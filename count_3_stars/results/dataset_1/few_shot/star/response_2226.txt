Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 5, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we can see that for a 3-star pattern to exist, the node must be connected to exactly three other nodes in the graph.

Therefore, the node that can act as the central node for a 3-star must have three neighbors. Let's identify such nodes:
1. Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 1, 6, 7, 9
2. Node 1 has 5 neighbors: 0, 4, 5, 7, 9
3. Node 7 has 5 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 8, 9
4. Node 9 has 6 neighbors: 0, 1, 4, 5, 7, 8

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (1, 6, 9)>
<1, (0, 4, 5)>
<7, (0, 2, 8)>
<9, (1, 4, 5)>
 
There are 4 unique 3-stars found in the given graph. So, the final answer is [4].
