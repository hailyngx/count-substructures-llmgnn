Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 7

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star-like pattern.

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<5, (2, 3, 4)>
<7, (2, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
