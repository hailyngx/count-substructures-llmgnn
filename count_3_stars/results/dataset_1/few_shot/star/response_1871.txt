Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 8) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 8
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars present in the graph. 

Let's list down all the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (2, 4, 8)>
<2, (0, 4, 7)>
<4, (0, 2, 8)>
<7, (2, 9, 0)>
<9, (3, 7, 0)>

Count the number of 3-stars: [5]
