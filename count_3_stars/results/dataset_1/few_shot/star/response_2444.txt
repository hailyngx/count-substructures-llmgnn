Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (4, 7) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 7
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 6

Response:
First, we can identify the nodes that are connected by an edge. Then, we will look for 3-stars, which consist of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes.

From the given edges, we can draw the connections:
- Node 0: (0, 2)
- Node 1: (1, 2), (1, 7), (1, 8)
- Node 2: (2, 0), (2, 1)
- Node 4: (4, 7)
- Node 6: (6, 7), (6, 9)
- Node 7: (7, 1), (7, 4), (7, 6)
- Node 8: (8, 1)
- Node 9: (9, 6)

Next, let's find the 3-stars:
- <1, (2, 7, 8)>
- <7, (1, 4, 6)>

Now, counting the total number of 3-stars:
[2]
