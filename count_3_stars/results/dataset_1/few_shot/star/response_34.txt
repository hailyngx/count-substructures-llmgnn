Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to look for all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. These instances represent 3-star structures. 

Looking at the given graph, we can find the following 3-stars:
<1, (3, 6, 9)>
<2, (6, 8, 9)>
<6, (1, 2, 5)>
<6, (1, 2, 7)>
<6, (1, 5, 7)>
<6, (2, 5, 7)>
<9, (2, 6, 9)>

Counting these unique 3-stars, we find a total of [7] 3-stars in the graph.
