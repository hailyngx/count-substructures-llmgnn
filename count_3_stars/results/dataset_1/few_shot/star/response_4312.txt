Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that forms a 3-star. Since a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can identify these structures in the graph by examining each node's neighbors.

Let's go through each node to find the 3-stars:

1. For Node 0:
   Node 0 has two neighbors: Node 1 and Node 4. No 3-star is formed around Node 0.

2. For Node 1:
   Node 1 has three neighbors: Node 0, Node 2, and Node 3.
   <1, (0, 2, 3)> is a 3-star.

3. For Node 2:
   Node 2 has six neighbors: Node 1, Node 3, Node 4, Node 5, Node 7, and Node 8.
   <2, (1, 3, 4)>
   <2, (1, 4, 8)>
   <2, (3, 8, 4)>

4. For Node 3:
   Node 3 has four neighbors: Node 1, Node 2, Node 6, and Node 8.
   <3, (1, 2, 8)>
   <3, (1, 8, 4)>

5. For Node 4:
   Node 4 has five neighbors: Node 0, Node 2, Node 5, Node 7, and Node 8.
   <4, (0, 2, 5)>
   <4, (0, 2, 7)>
   <4, (0, 2, 8)>
   <4, (2, 5, 7)>
   <4, (2, 5, 8)>
   <4, (2, 7, 8)>

6. For Node 5:
   Node 5 has three neighbors: Node 2, Node 4, and Node 6.
   No 3-star is formed around Node 5.

7. For Node 6:
   Node 6 has two neighbors: Node 3 and Node 5.
   No 3-star is formed around Node 6.

8. For Node 7:
   Node 7 has two neighbors: Node 2 and Node 4.
   No 3-star is formed around Node 7.

9. For Node 8:
   Node 8 has four neighbors: Node 2, Node 3, Node 4.
   No 3-star is formed around Node 8.

10. Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes, so it does not form a 3-star.

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars found in the given graph: [9] 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (0, 2, 3)>, <2, (1, 3, 4)>, <2, (1, 4, 8)>, <2, (3, 8, 4)>, <3, (1, 2, 8)>, <3, (1, 8, 4)>, <4, (0, 2, 5)>, <4, (0, 2, 7)>, <4, (0, 2, 8)>
