Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 7
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in the graph.

Let's list all of the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (2, 4, 7)>
<0, (2, 7, 9)>
<1, (4, 7, 9)>
<2, (0, 3, 6)>
<2, (3, 6, 9)>
<2, (6, 7, 9)>
<3, (2, 6, 7)>
<7, (0, 3, 4)>
<7, (0, 4, 9)>
<7, (3, 4, 9)>
<8, (1, 3, 7)>
<9, (0, 2, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
