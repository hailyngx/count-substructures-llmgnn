Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 6

Response:
Based on the given graph and its adjacency list, let's count the number of 3-stars.

We can identify the 3-stars by finding nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Here are the 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (3, 5, 2)>
<1, (7, 8, 9)>
<2, (3, 5, 8)>
<5, (0, 2, 6)>
<9, (1, 4, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5]. 
The unique 3-stars are <0, (3, 5, 2)>, <1, (7, 8, 9)>, <2, (3, 5, 8)>, <5, (0, 2, 6)>, and <9, (1, 4, 6)>.
