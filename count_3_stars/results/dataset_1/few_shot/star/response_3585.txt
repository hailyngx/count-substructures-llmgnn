Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 8

Response:
Based on the given information, the graph can be represented as follows:

```
0 -- 4, 7, 8
1 -- 
2 -- 
3 -- 6, 8
4 -- 0, 9
5 -- 8
6 -- 3
7 -- 0
8 -- 0, 3, 5, 9
9 -- 4, 8
```

To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to look for each node that has exactly 3 neighbors and check if these neighbors form a 3-star with the node as the center.

Let's list the unique 3-stars found:

<0, (4, 7, 8)>
<3, (6, 8, 9)>
<4, (0, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 3, 5)>
<9, (4, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
