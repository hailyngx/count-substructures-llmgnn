Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all 3-stars, which are essentially a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we can see that the nodes in the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's proceed to find the 3-stars:

1. Node 0: (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 6)
   <0, (3, 5, 6)> 

2. Node 4: (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6)
   <4, (3, 5, 6)> 

3. Node 5: (5, 0), (5, 4), (5, 8)
   <5, (0, 4, 8)> 

4. Node 8: (8, 1), (8, 2), (8, 5)
   <8, (1, 2, 5)> 

5. Node 9: (9, 2), (9, 4), (9, 5)
   <9, (2, 4, 5)> 

Count of 3-stars: [5]
Unique 3-stars: <<0, (3, 5, 6)>, <4, (3, 5, 6)>, <5, (0, 4, 8)>, <8, (1, 2, 5)>, <9, (2, 4, 5)>]
