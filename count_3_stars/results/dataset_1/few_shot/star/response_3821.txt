Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's analyze the graph based on the provided information.

1. **Identify Candidate Central Nodes**:
   - Nodes 0, 1, 3, and 6 have degrees of 5, 4, 4, and 4 respectively, which makes them candidates for central nodes in 3-stars.

2. **Check for 3-Stars**:
   - For Node 0: (0, 2, 4, 5) is a 3-star, and (0, 2, 5, 8) is another 3-star.
   - For Node 1: (1, 4, 6, 9) is a 3-star.
   - For Node 3: No 3-star since its adjacent nodes are not connected as required.
   - For Node 6: No 3-star since its adjacent nodes are not connected as required.

3. **Count the 3-Stars**:
   - Number of 3-stars = 3

Therefore, the answer is [3].

Unique 3-stars found:
- <0, (2, 4, 5)>
- <0, (2, 5, 8)>
- <1, (4, 6, 9)>
