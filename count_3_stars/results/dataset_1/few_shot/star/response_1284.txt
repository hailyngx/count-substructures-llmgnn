Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 5, and node 7

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are:

<0, (2, 6, 9)>
<1, (4, 5, 6)>
<2, (0, 3, 8)>
<4, (1, 5, 6)>
<5, (1, 2, 3)>
<9, (0, 4, 7)>
