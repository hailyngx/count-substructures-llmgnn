Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 7

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (4, 8, 9)>
<2, (3, 6, 8)>
<4, (0, 6, 8)>
<6, (2, 4, 8)>
<8, (0, 4, 6)>
<9, (0, 6, 7)>

Count = 6

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
