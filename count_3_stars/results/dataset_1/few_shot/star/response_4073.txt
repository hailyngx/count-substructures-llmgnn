Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. We can then list these 3-stars. 

The nodes in the graph are numbered from 0 to 9, and each node has the following connections:
- Node 0: (1, 2, 4, 7, 8)
- Node 1: (0, 3, 7)
- Node 2: (0, 4)
- Node 3: (1, 7, 9)
- Node 4: (0, 2, 6)
- Node 5: (8)
- Node 6: (4, 7, 9)
- Node 7: (0, 1, 3, 6)
- Node 8: (0, 5)
- Node 9: (3, 6)

Let's list the unique 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<0, (1, 7, 8)>
<0, (2, 4, 8)>
<1, (0, 3, 7)>
<3, (1, 7, 9)>
<4, (0, 2, 6)>
<4, (6, 7, 9)>
<7, (0, 1, 6)>
<7, (3, 6, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
