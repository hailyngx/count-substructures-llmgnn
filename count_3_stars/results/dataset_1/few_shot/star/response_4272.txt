Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 9) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 4, 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that serves as the center of a 3-star. Since a 3-star has a central node connected to exactly 3 other nodes, we need to identify nodes that have exactly 3 neighbors connected to them. Let's list down the 3-stars in the graph:

<1, (5, 2, 8)>
<2, (1, 5, 8)>
<3, (9, 4, 7)>
<4, (5, 8, 9)>
<6, (9, 7, -)>
<7, (8, 9, 6)>
<8, (1, 2, 4)>
<9, (3, 4, 6)>

Counting these unique 3-stars, we find that there are [8] 3-stars in total.
