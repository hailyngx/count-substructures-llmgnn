Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 8
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the unique configurations where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Let's analyze the graph step by step:

1. Node 0: Forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 4, and 8. <0, (2, 4, 8)>

2. Node 2: Forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 4, and 9. <2, (0, 4, 9)>

3. Node 4: Forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 2, and 7. <4, (0, 2, 7)>

4. Node 7: Forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 8, and 9. <7, (4, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
