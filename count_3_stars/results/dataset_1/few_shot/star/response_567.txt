Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can identify the 3-stars by looking for nodes with exactly three edges connected to them. 

Based on the given graph and the definition of a 3-star, we can identify the unique 3-stars as follows:
<0, (4, 5, 7)>
<0, (4, 5, 8)>
<0, (4, 7, 5)>
<0, (5, 7, 8)>
<0, (7, 4, 5)>

Counting these unique 3-stars gives us a total of [5].
