Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we can look for each node that has exactly three neighbors and check if it forms a 3-star. 

The nodes that have exactly three neighbors are: 3, 4, 6, and 8.

Let's go through each of these potential center nodes and determine if they form a 3-star with their neighbors:

1. Node 3:
    - (3, 0, 2, 6): Not a 3-star (more than 3 neighbors).
    - (3, 2, 6, 0): Not a 3-star (more than 3 neighbors).

2. Node 4:
    - (4, 1, 2, 9): <4, (1, 2, 9)> (a 3-star).
    - (4, 2, 1, 9): <4, (1, 2, 9)> (this is the same 3-star as above).

3. Node 6:
    - (6, 3, 5, 8): <6, (3, 5, 8)> (a 3-star).
    - (6, 5, 3, 8): <6, (3, 5, 8)> (this is the same 3-star as above).
    - (6, 8, 9, 3): Not a 3-star (more than 3 neighbors).
    - (6, 9, 8, 4): Not a 3-star (more than 3 neighbors).

4. Node 8:
    - (8, 6, 7, 9): Not a 3-star (more than 3 neighbors).
    - (8, 7, 6, 9): Not a 3-star (more than 3 neighbors).
    - (8, 9, 6, 4): Not a 3-star (more than 3 neighbors).
    - (8, 9, 4, 6): Not a 3-star (more than 3 neighbors).

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is: [2].

The unique 3-stars found are: <4, (1, 2, 9)>, <6, (3, 5, 8)>.
