Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a 3-star pattern.

Looking at the adjacency list for each node given, we can determine the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, and 7. Thus, <0, (1, 2, 4)>, <0, (1, 2, 7)> are 3-stars.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 5, and 7. Thus, <1, (0, 5, 7)> is a 3-star.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0 and 7. Since it is not part of any 3-star.
4. Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0 and 5. Since it is not part of any 3-star.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 7. Since it is not part of any unique 3-star.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 0 and 7. Since it is not part of any unique 3-star.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, and 6. Since it is not part of any unique 3-star.
9. Nodes 8 and 9 are not connected to any other nodes.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2]. 
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 2, 4)>, <0, (1, 2, 7)>
