Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 1) (4, 7) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern.

Looking at the adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (1, 7, 8)>
<1, (0, 3, 7)>
<6, (7, 8, 0)>

Therefore, there are [3] 3-stars in the given graph.
