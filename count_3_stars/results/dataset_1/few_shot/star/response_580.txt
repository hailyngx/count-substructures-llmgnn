Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars, we need to identify all occurrences where a node has exactly 3 neighbors, which will form a 3-star around that node.

From the adjacency list:
- Nodes 3 and 6 have 1 neighbor each, so they cannot be the centers of 3-stars.
- Nodes 0, 1, 5, and 8 have more than 3 neighbors, so they also cannot be the centers of 3-stars.

Now, let's check the remaining nodes:
- Node 2 has exactly 5 neighbors: 0, 4, 5, 7, and 9.
- Node 4 has exactly 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, and 6.
- Node 7 has exactly 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, and 9.
- Node 9 has exactly 5 neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 7, and 8.

Therefore, the nodes 2, 4, 7, and 9 can act as centers of 3-stars since they each have exactly 3 neighbors.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<2, (0, 5, 9)>
<4, (0, 1, 6)>
<7, (0, 1, 9)>
<9, (0, 2, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
