Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible 3-stars by finding all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Let's list all the 3-stars that exist in this graph:

<0, (5, 9, 2)>
<2, (3, 9, 8)>
<4, (5, 9, 7)>
<5, (0, 4, 8)>
<8, (2, 5, 7)>
<9, (0, 2, 4)>

[There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph, so the count of 3-stars is [6].]
