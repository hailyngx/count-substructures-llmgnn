Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a 3-star. Let's go through each node and check for 3-stars:

1. Node 0: Not part of any 3-star.
2. Node 1: <1, (2, 6, 7)>
3. Node 2: Not part of any 3-star.
4. Node 3: Not connected to any other nodes.
5. Node 4: <4, (0, 5, 7)> and <4, (7, 9, 5)>
6. Node 5: Not part of any 3-star.
7. Node 6: <6, (1, 7, 2)>
8. Node 7: <7, (4, 6, 9)> and <7, (6, 9, 4)>
9. Node 8: Not part of any 3-star.
10. Node 9: <9, (4, 7, 8)>

Count of 3-stars: [6]
Unique 3-stars:
<1, (2, 6, 7)>
<4, (0, 5, 7)>
<4, (7, 9, 5)>
<6, (1, 7, 2)>
<7, (4, 6, 9)>
<7, (6, 9, 4)>
