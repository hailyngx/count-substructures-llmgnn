Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's find all the 3-stars present in the graph:

<0, (3, 5, 7)>
<1, (7, 8, None)>
<2, (7, None, None)>
<3, (0, 8, None)>
<4, (5, 6, 7)>
<5, (0, 4, 6)>
<7, (0, 1, 2)>
<8, (1, 3, None)>
<9, (4, 7, None)>

Count = [8]
