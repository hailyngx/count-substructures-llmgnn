Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will look for each node and check if it forms a 3-star with its neighbors. 

Let's go through each node:
1. Node 0:
   - Forms 3-stars with (3, 6, 8) and (6, 0, 8)
   <0, (3, 6, 8)>, <0, (6, 3, 8)>

2. Node 1:
   - Forms 3-stars with (2, 6, 8) and (6, 1, 8)
   <1, (2, 6, 8)>, <1, (6, 2, 8)>

3. Node 2:
   - Forms 3-star with (1, 8, 9)
   <2, (1, 8, 9)>, <2, (8, 1, 9)>

4. Node 3:
   - Forms 3-star with (0, 5, 6) and (5, 0, 6)
   <3, (0, 5, 6)>, <3, (5, 0, 6)>

5. Node 4:
   - Does not form any 3-star.

6. Node 5:
   - Forms 3-star with (0, 3, 6) and (6, 0, 3)
   <5, (0, 3, 6)>, <5, (3, 0, 6)>

7. Node 6:
   - Forms 3-stars with (0, 5, 3), (0, 3, 9), and (5, 3, 9)
   <6, (0, 5, 3)>, <6, (0, 3, 9)>, <6, (5, 3, 9)>

8. Node 7:
   - Does not form any 3-star.

9. Node 8:
   - Forms 3-star with (0, 1, 2)
   <8, (0, 1, 2)>, <8, (1, 0, 2)>

10. Node 9:
   - Forms 3-star with (2, 3, 6) and (6, 2, 3)
   <9, (2, 3, 6)>, <9, (3, 2, 6)>

Count of 3-stars: [10]

Unique 3-stars: <0, (3, 6, 8)>, <0, (6, 3, 8)>, <1, (2, 6, 8)>, <1, (6, 2, 8)>, <2, (1, 8, 9)>, <2, (8, 1, 9)>, <3, (0, 5, 6)>, <3, (5, 0, 6)>, <5, (0, 3, 6)>, <5, (3, 0, 6)>, <6, (0, 5, 3)>, <6, (0, 3, 9)>, <6, (5, 3, 9)>, <8, (0, 1, 2)>, <8, (1, 0, 2)>, <9, (2, 3, 6)>, <9, (3, 2, 6)>
