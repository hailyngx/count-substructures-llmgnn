Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all possible instances of 3-stars. 

Since a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can look at each node's connections to identify the 3-stars. 

Let's go through each node and its connections:

1. Node 0: Connected to nodes 3, 5, 7, 8, 9
2. Node 1: Connected to node 2
3. Node 2: Connected to nodes 1, 7, 9
4. Node 3: Connected to nodes 0, 8
5. Node 4: Connected to node 9
6. Node 5: Connected to nodes 0, 6
7. Node 6: Connected to node 5
8. Node 7: Connected to nodes 0, 2
9. Node 8: Connected to nodes 0, 3, 9
10. Node 9: Connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
<0, (3, 5, 7)>
<0, (3, 5, 8)>
<0, (3, 7, 8)>
<0, (5, 7, 8)>
<0, (5, 7, 9)>
<0, (5, 8, 9)>
<0, (7, 8, 9)>
<3, (0, 8, 9)>
<5, (0, 7, 9)>
<7, (0, 2, 9)>
<8, (0, 3, 9)>
<9, (0, 2, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
