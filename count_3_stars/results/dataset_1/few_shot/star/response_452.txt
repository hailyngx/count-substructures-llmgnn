Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 7

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph can be identified by finding nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list all the 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (1, 2, 0)>
<1, (0, 8, 1)>
<2, (0, 3, 2)>
<3, (2, 4, 5)>
<5, (3, 8, 5)>
<8, (1, 5, 8)>
<7, (3, 9, 7)>

Count of 3-stars in the graph: [7]
