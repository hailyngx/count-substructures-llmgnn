Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 6, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can go through each node and check if it forms a 3-star with its neighbors. 

Here is the process:
1. Node 0: No 3-star.
2. Node 1: <1, (2, 3, 4)>
3. Node 2: No 3-star.
4. Node 3: <3, (1, 2, 5)> and <3, (1, 2, 8)>
5. Node 4: No 3-star.
6. Node 5: No 3-star.
7. Node 6: No 3-star.
8. Node 7: <7, (0, 2, 4)> and <7, (0, 2, 9)>
9. Node 8: No 3-star.
10. Node 9: <9, (0, 4, 6)> and <9, (0, 4, 7)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

Unique 3-stars: 
<1, (2, 3, 4)>, <3, (1, 2, 5)>, <3, (1, 2, 8)>, <7, (0, 2, 4)>, <7, (0, 2, 9)>, <9, (0, 4, 6)>, <9, (0, 4, 7)>
