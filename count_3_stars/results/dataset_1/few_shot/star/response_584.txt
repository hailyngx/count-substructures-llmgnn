Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 5
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 7, and node 8

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are: 
[<0, (3, 4, 5)>] 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1].
