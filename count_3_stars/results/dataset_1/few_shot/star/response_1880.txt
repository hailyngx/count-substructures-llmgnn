Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, and node 6

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes and their adjacent nodes. 
- Node 0 has adjacent nodes 4, 5, 8
- Node 1 has adjacent nodes 2, 6
- Node 2 has adjacent nodes 1, 5
- Node 3 has adjacent node 5
- Node 4 has adjacent nodes 0, 5, 7
- Node 5 has adjacent nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9
- Node 6 has adjacent nodes 1, 7, 9
- Node 7 has adjacent nodes 4, 5, 6
- Node 8 has adjacent node 0
- Node 9 has adjacent nodes 5, 6

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph. 

We have the following 3-stars:
- <0, (4, 5, 8)>
- <1, (2, 5, 6)>
- <5, (0, 4, 7)>
- <5, (2, 3, 9)>
- <5, (4, 7, 9)>
- <6, (1, 7, 9)>

Therefore, we have a total of [6] unique 3-stars in the graph.
