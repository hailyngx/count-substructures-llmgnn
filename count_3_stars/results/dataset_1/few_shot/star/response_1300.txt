Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node has exactly three neighbors, and these neighbors are not directly connected to each other. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we can identify the following nodes with exactly three neighbors:
- Node 1: connected to nodes 4, 7, 8
- Node 2: connected to nodes 0, 4, 5
- Node 4: connected to nodes 1, 2, 6, 7, 9
- Node 7: connected to nodes 1, 4, 6

Now, let's find all possible unique 3-stars in the graph:
<1, (4, 7, 8)>
<2, (0, 4, 5)>
<4, (1, 2, 6)>
<7, (1, 4, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
