Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify the 3-stars by looking for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Then, we can count the unique combinations of 3-stars.

In this graph:
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, and 7, forming a 3-star: <6, (2, 3, 4)>
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 6, and 9, forming a 3-star: <2, (3, 6, 9)>
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 5, forming a 3-star: <8, (0, 1, 5)>
- Node 1 is not part of any 3-star since it is only connected to nodes 8 and 9.
- Node 0, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 9 are also not part of any 3-star based on the given edges.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3]. 
The unique 3-stars found are <6, (2, 3, 4)>, <2, (3, 6, 9)>, and <8, (0, 1, 5)>.
