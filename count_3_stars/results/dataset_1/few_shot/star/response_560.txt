Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 8) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the 3-stars by finding the center node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list the unique 3-stars found:

<0, (3, 9, 8)>
<3, (0, 8, 9)>
<4, (6, 7, 5)>
<6, (2, 4, 5)>
<8, (1, 3, 9)>
<9, (0, 6, 8)>

Count of 3-stars: [6]
