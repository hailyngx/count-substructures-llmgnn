Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 3

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the 3-stars present. 

Let's first list all the 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (3, 7, 2)>
<1, (4, 6, 2)>
<2, (3, 4, 6)>
<3, (0, 2, 9)>
<4, (1, 2, 5)>
<6, (1, 2, 7)>

Now, we count the total number of unique 3-stars found: [6]
