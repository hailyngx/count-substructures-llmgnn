Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

We can start by identifying the 3-stars by looking at each node as a potential center of a 3-star. A 3-star consists of a center node and three leaves connected to the center.

Let's go through each node:
- Node 0: No 3-star as it has connections with only 3 nodes (less than 3 leaves).
- Node 1: No 3-star as it has connections with only 3 nodes (less than 3 leaves).
- Node 2: No 3-star as it has connections with only 2 nodes (less than 3 leaves).
- Node 3: No 3-star as it has connections with only 2 nodes (less than 3 leaves).
- Node 4: Possible 3-star with center at 4: <4, (0, 3, 6)>.
- Node 5: No 3-star as it has connections with only 4 nodes (less than 3 leaves).
- Node 6: No 3-star as it has connections with only 3 nodes (less than 3 leaves).
- Node 7: No 3-star as it has connections with only 4 nodes (less than 3 leaves).
- Node 8: No 3-star as it has connections with only 4 nodes (less than 3 leaves).
- Node 9: No 3-star as it has connections with only 2 nodes (less than 3 leaves).

The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1].

Unique 3-stars: <4, (0, 3, 6)>
