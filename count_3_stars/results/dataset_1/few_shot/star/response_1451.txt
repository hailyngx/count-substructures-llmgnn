Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 4) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, and node 6

Response:
Step 1: Identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.
Nodes 0, 6, and 8 are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Step 2: For each of these nodes, identify the 3-star configurations.
For Node 0: (0, 2, 5, 7), (0, 2, 7, 8), (0, 5, 7, 8)
For Node 6: (6, 1, 8, 9), (6, 8, 9, 5), (6, 1, 9, 5)
For Node 8: (8, 0, 2, 6), (8, 6, 0, 9), (8, 2, 6, 9)

Step 3: Count the total number of unique 3-star configurations.
<0, (2, 5, 7, 8)>, <6, (1, 8, 9, 5)>, <8, (0, 2, 6, 9)>
