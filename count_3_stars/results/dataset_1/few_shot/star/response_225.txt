Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to focus on the nodes that are connected in the specific pattern of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Looking at the given graph:
- Node 5 has three connections to nodes 4, 7, and 9.
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 7, and 9 as its leaves: <5, (4, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1].
