Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 4

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are as follows:
<2, (1, 4, 9)>
<4, (0, 2, 9)>
<7, (2, 3, 6)>
