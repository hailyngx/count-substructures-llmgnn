Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each possible 3-star combination where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Observations: 
- Node 9 is the only node connected to three other nodes (0, 6, and 8), making it a possible center for a 3-star.
- Nodes 0, 5, and 6 are only connected to node 9, making them potential leaves of a 3-star.
- Nodes 1, 2, and 4 are connected to node 9 and to at least two other nodes, making them potential leaves or centers of 3-stars.

Let's explore all possible 3-star combinations:
1. Node 9 as the center:
   - <9, (0, 5, 6)>
   - <9, (1, 2, 8)>
   - <9, (1, 4, 8)>
   - <9, (4, 5, 6)>
   - <9, (1, 5, 6)>
   - <9, (1, 0, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
