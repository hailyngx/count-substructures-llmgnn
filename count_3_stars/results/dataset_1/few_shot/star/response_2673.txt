Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 7

Response:
The center node of a 3-star must have degree 3 and the leaves must have degree 1. Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph step by step: 

First, let's list the nodes with degree 3:
- Node 0 is connected to 4 other nodes.
- Node 1 is connected to 3 other nodes. 
- Node 7 is connected to 4 other nodes.

Next, let's identify the 3-stars involving these nodes:
- <0, (1, 6, 7)>
- <1, (0, 5, 7)>
- <7, (0, 1, 9)>
- <7, (0, 1, 8)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars.
