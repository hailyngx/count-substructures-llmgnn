Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 4

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].

Here are the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (4, 8, 9)>
<1, (3, 5, 6)>
<1, (5, 8, 3)>
