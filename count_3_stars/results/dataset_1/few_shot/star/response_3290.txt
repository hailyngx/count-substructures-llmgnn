Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern.

Looking at the adjacency list, we see that nodes 0, 2, 6, and 8 are not connected to exactly three other nodes, so they cannot be part of any 3-star.

Now let's analyze the remaining nodes:

- Node 1 is connected to four other nodes: 4, 5, 6, and 7.
    - It forms one 3-star: <1, (4, 6, 7)>

- Node 3 is connected to four other nodes: 0, 2, 5, and 9.
    - It forms one 3-star: <3, (0, 5, 9)>

- Node 4 is connected to five other nodes: 0, 1, 6, 7, and 9.
    - It forms two 3-stars: <4, (0, 6, 9)> and <4, (1, 6, 7)>

- Node 5 is connected to two other nodes: 1 and 3, which is less than three, so it cannot form a 3-star.

- Node 7 is connected to three other nodes: 1, 4, and 8.
    - It forms one 3-star: <7, (1, 4, 8)>

- Node 9 is connected to three other nodes: 3 and 4.
    - It forms one 3-star: <9, (3, 0, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4]:
<1, (4, 6, 7)>, <3, (0, 5, 9)>, <4, (0, 6, 9)>, <4, (1, 6, 7)>
