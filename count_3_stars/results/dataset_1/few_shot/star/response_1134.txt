Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern. A 3-star pattern consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- From the adjacency list, we can see that there are three potential center nodes: 0, 1, and 2. 
- Let's find the 3-star patterns around each potential center:

1. Center node 0:
    <0, (1, 2, 5)>
    Explanation: Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 5.

2. Center node 1:
    <1, (0, 6, 8)>
    Explanation: Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 6, and 8.

3. Center node 2:
    <2, (0, 3, 7)>
    Explanation: Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 7.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
