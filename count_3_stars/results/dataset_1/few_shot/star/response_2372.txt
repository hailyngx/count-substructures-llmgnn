Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes (making a 3-star). Let's start by listing all possible 3-stars:

<0, (5, 7, 9)>
<1, (2, 3, 8)>
<2, (1, 3, 7)>
<3, (1, 2, 4)>
<4, (3, 6, 8)>
<5, (0, 6)>
<6, (4, 5)>
<7, (0, 2, 9)>
<8, (1, 4)>
<9, (0, 1, 7)>

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars: [10].
