Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all possible 3-stars. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 3 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 1, 2, 5: <3, (1, 2, 5)>
2. Node 3 forms another 3-star with its neighbors 1, 6, 7: <3, (1, 6, 7)>
3. Node 5 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 3, 4, 6: <5, (3, 4, 6)>
4. Node 5 forms another 3-star with its neighbors 3, 6, 7: <5, (3, 6, 7)>
5. Node 7 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 5, 6, 8: <7, (5, 6, 8)>
6. Node 7 forms another 3-star with its neighbors 3, 6, 9: <7, (3, 6, 9)>

Finally, counting the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph, we have the following list: 
<[3, (1, 2, 5)>, <3, (1, 6, 7)>, <5, (3, 4, 6)>, <5, (3, 6, 7)>, <7, (5, 6, 8)>, <7, (3, 6, 9)>]

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
