Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through the nodes and identify the 3-stars:

Node 0:
- <0, (1, 6, 7)> (3-star 1)
- <0, (2, 6, 9)> (3-star 2)

Node 1:
- Not part of any 3-star.

Node 2:
- Not part of any 3-star.

Node 3:
- Not part of any 3-star.

Node 4:
- <4, (3, 5, 9)> (3-star 3)

Node 5:
- Not part of any 3-star.

Node 6:
- <6, (0, 4, 8)> (3-star 4)

Node 7:
- Not part of any 3-star.

Node 8:
- Not part of any 3-star.

Node 9:
- Not part of any 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4]. 

<0, (1, 6, 7)>, <0, (2, 6, 9)>, <4, (3, 5, 9)>, <6, (0, 4, 8)>
