Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 8

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node has exactly three neighbors and those neighbors are all connected to each other through the central node. 

Based on the provided adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars: 
<0, (3, 5, 7)>
<1, (2, 3, 5)>
<2, (1, 7, 9)>
<3, (0, 1, 8)>
<4, (3, 8, 9)>
<5, (0, 1, -)>
<6, (1, 7, 9)>
<7, (0, 2, 6)>
<8, (2, 3, 4)>
<9, (2, 6, 8)>

So, there are a total of [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
