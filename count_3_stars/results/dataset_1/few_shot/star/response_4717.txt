Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (3, 8) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can identify each 3-star by finding nodes that form a 3-star configuration around a central node. 

1. Let's analyze the graph:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 8, and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2 and 7.
- Node 2 is connected to node 1.
- Node 3 is connected to node 8.
- Node 4 is connected to node 5.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0 and 4.
- Node 6 is connected to node 0.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1 and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 7, and 8.

2. Let's find the 3-stars by looking for nodes connected to exactly 3 other nodes:
- <0, (5, 8, 9)>
- <8, (0, 3, 9)>
- <9, (0, 7, 8)>

3. Count the unique 3-stars found:
[3] 

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3]. 

Unique 3-stars: 
<0, (5, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 3, 9)>
<9, (0, 7, 8)>
