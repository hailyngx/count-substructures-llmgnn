Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 8

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star-like manner.

Considering the given graph, we can identify the following 3-stars:

<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<1, (5, 7, 8)>
<2, (0, 4, 5)>
<4, (2, 5, 9)>
<5, (0, 1, 2)>
<8, (6, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
