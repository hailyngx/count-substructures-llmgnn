Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 8

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the 3-stars. Since a 3-star graph consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we need to find nodes with degree 3 in the given graph.

The central nodes with degree 3 are: 
- Node 1
- Node 4
- Node 8

Now, let's find the 3-stars with these central nodes:

<1, (2, 5, 6)>  
<1, (7, 8, 4)>  
<4, (0, 2, 8)>  
<8, (1, 9, 4)>  

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
