Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 8

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (2, 6, 7)>
- Node 1 forms another 3-star: <1, (7, 8, 6)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star: <7, (1, 2, 0)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star: <8, (1, 4, 9)>

Now, count the total number of 3-stars: [4]
Final answer: [4]
