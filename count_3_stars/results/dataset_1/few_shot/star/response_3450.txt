Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, and node 7

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the 3-stars by locating the central node and its three connecting nodes. 

From the adjacency list, the possible 3-stars are as follows:

<0, (3, 6, 7)>
<1, (2, 4, 8)>
<3, (0, 5, 9)>
<4, (1, 5, 7)>
<5, (3, 4, 9)>
<6, (0, 9, 7)>
<7, (0, 1, 4)>
<9, (3, 5, 6)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we get 8 unique 3-stars in total. 

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
