Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 4, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to understand what a 3-star is. In this case, a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Given the information provided, let's identify each 3-star in the graph:

- Node 0: <0, (3, 5, 7)>
- Node 2: <2, (1, 4, 5)>
- Node 4: <4, (1, 2, 5)>
- Node 7: <7, (0, 4, 5)>
- Node 9: <9, (0, 4, 7)>

Now, we have identified the 3-stars in the graph. Counting them, we have a total of [5] 3-stars.
