Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 4, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars, we need to identify each unique 3-star in the graph.

There are multiple 3-stars in the given graph. Let's list them out:
<0, (2, 8, 9)>
<1, (6, 7, 8)>
<2, (0, 8, 9)>
<3, (9)>
<4, (9)>
<5, (6)>
<6, (1, 5)>
<7, (1, 8)>
<8, (0, 1, 7)>
<9, (0, 2, 8)>

So, there are a total of [10] 3-stars in the graph.
