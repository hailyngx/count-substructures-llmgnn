Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node and its adjacent nodes in each 3-star configuration. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we see that Node 7 is the central node in several potential 3-star configurations because it is connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, and 9. Let's list the 3-stars with Node 7 as the central node:

<7, (1, 4, 9)>
<7, (1, 3, 9)>
<7, (3, 4, 9)>
<7, (1, 4, 3)>

Calculating all the 3-stars with Node 7 as the central node, we get a total of [4].
