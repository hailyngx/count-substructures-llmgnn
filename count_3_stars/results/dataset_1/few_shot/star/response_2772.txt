Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 3) (5, 8) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify 3-stars by finding central nodes connected to exactly three other nodes. 
Let's list all the 3-stars found in the graph: 
<0, (2, 3, 8)>
<0, (2, 8, 9)>
<0, (3, 8, 9)>
<2, (0, 1, 8)>

Count of 3-stars: [4]
