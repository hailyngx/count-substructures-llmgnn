Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 9

Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars. Here is the step-by-step process:

1. Count the triangles (3-cycles) in the graph. Each triangle represents a 3-star.
2. Count the number of 3-stars that are not triangles.

Let's start with step 1 to find all the triangles (3-cycles):
We have the following triangles in the graph:
- Triangle 1: <3, (1, 4, 7)>
- Triangle 2: <7, (1, 4, 5)>
- Triangle 3: <9, (2, 8, 9)>

Now, let's move on to step 2 to find 3-stars that are not triangles:
We have the following additional 3-stars that are not triangles:
- <0, (4, 1, 7)>
- <5, (3, 7, 1)>
- <6, (7, 1, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6]. 
The unique 3-stars found are <3, (1, 4, 7)>, <7, (1, 4, 5)>, <9, (2, 8, 9)>, <0, (4, 1, 7)>, <5, (3, 7, 1)>, and <6, (7, 1, 4)>.
