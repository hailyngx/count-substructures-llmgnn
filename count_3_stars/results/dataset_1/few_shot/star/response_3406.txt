Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of nodes where one node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through the graph step by step to find all the 3-stars:

1. Node 0:
   - <0, (1, 3, 6)>
   - <0, (1, 3, 9)>
   - <0, (1, 6, 9)>

2. Node 1:
   - No 3-star as it is only connected to one node.

3. Node 2:
   - No 3-star as it is only connected to two nodes.

4. Node 3:
   - <3, (0, 6, 8)>
   - <3, (0, 6, 9)>

5. Node 4:
   - No 3-star as it is only connected to two nodes.

6. Node 5:
   - No 3-star as it is only connected to one node.

7. Node 6:
   - <6, (0, 3, 7)>
   - <6, (0, 7, 9)>
   - <6, (3, 7, 9)>

8. Node 7:
   - <7, (2, 4, 5)>
   - <7, (2, 4, 6)>
   - <7, (2, 4, 8)>
   - <7, (2, 5, 6)>
   - <7, (2, 5, 9)>
   - <7, (2, 6, 9)>
   - <7, (4, 5, 6)>
   - <7, (4, 5, 9)>
   - <7, (4, 6, 9)>
   - <7, (5, 6, 9)>

9. Node 8:
   - No 3-star as it is only connected to three nodes.

10. Node 9:
   - <9, (0, 3, 6)>
   - <9, (0, 7, 6)>
   - <9, (3, 6, 7)>

Count of 3-stars: [16]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 16.
