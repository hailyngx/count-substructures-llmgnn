Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 7

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible 3-stars by observing which nodes are connected in a star pattern with a central node.

From the given information, we find that the 3-stars in this graph are:
<0, (4, 8, 6)>
<2, (3, 5, 7)>
<6, (1, 4, 8)>
<7, (2, 8, 9)>

Count of 3-stars: [4]
