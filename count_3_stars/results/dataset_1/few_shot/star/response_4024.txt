Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 5
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 8

Response:
Given the information provided, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 0 forms a 3-star: <0, (5, 6, 8)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star: <8, (0, 1, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (5, 6, 8)>, <8, (0, 1, 2)>.
