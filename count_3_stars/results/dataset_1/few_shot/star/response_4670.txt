Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 7) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 9
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-star configurations in the given graph, we can focus on each node, check if it satisfies the criteria of being the center of a 3-star, and count the total. 

Based on the information provided, the nodes that can be the center of a 3-star are nodes 1, 4, 7, and 9 because they have exactly three edges connected to other nodes. 

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<1, (4, 7, 9)>
<4, (1, 9, 7)>
<7, (1, 2, 9)>
<9, (4, 5, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
