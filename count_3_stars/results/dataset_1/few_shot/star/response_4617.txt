Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 7

Response:
Considering the definition of a 3-star graph, we are looking for nodes that are connected in a star pattern with the center node. 
Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

1. <0, (6, 7, 8)>
2. <1, (3, 6, *)> (Note: The fourth leaf node is missing, as node 4 is not connected to any other nodes)
3. <2, (3, 7, *)>
4. <3, (1, 2, 7)>
5. <7, (0, 2, 9)>
6. <8, (0, 3, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
