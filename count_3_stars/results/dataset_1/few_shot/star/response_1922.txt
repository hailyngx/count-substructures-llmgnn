Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (4, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 8
