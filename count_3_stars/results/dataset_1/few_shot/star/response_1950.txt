Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 5, and node 8

Response:
Let's first identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph:

In a 3-star graph, the center node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Given the adjacency list, we can see that the following nodes have 3 connections:
- Node 4 (connected to nodes 0, 1, and 6)
- Node 8 (connected to nodes 4, 5, and 6)
- Node 9 (connected to nodes 1, 4, and 5)

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:
- For Node 4: <4, (0, 1, 6)>
- For Node 8: <8, (4, 5, 6)>
- For Node 9: <9, (1, 4, 5)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3]. 
The unique 3-stars are <4, (0, 1, 6)>, <8, (4, 5, 6)>, and <9, (1, 4, 5)>.
