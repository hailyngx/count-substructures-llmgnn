Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 8

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- From node 0: None
- From node 1: <1, (3, 4, 9)>
- From node 2: None
- From node 3: None
- From node 4: <4, (0, 1, 9)>, <4, (3, 5, 7)>
- From node 5: None
- From node 6: None
- From node 7: <7, (2, 4, 8)>
- From node 8: <8, (2, 5, 9)>, <8, (6, 7, 9)>
- From node 9: None

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
