Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 9) (7, 1) (8, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 5

Response:
Count of 3-stars: [3]

<0, (1, 4, 8)>
<1, (0, 3, 7)>
<9, (2, 3, 5)>
