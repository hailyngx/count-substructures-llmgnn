Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 2

Response:
There are two 3-stars in the given graph. 

1. <1, (2, 4, 6)>
2. <2, (1, 7, 9)>

[2]
