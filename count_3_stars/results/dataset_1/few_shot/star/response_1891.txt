Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 8
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 4, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will look for each node and see if it forms a 3-star with its neighbors. 

Let's analyze each node to identify any 3-stars:
- Node 0: Not a part of any 3-star.
- Node 1: Forms 1 3-star with nodes 6, 7, and 9. So far, we have found <1, (6, 7, 9)>.
- Node 2: Not a part of any 3-star.
- Node 4: Forms 1 3-star with nodes 2, 6, and 9. Adding <4, (2, 6, 9)>.
- Node 5: Not a part of any 3-star.
- Node 6: Forms 1 3-star with nodes 1, 4, and 7. Adding <6, (1, 4, 7)>.
- Node 7: Not a part of any additional 3-stars.
- Node 8: Not a part of any 3-star.
- Node 9: Forms 2 3-stars, one with nodes 1, 7, and 8. Adding <9, (1, 7, 8)> and the other with nodes 0, 4, and 7. Adding <9, (0, 4, 7)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4]. The unique 3-stars found are <1, (6, 7, 9)>, <4, (2, 6, 9)>, <6, (1, 4, 7)>, <9, (1, 7, 8)>, and <9, (0, 4, 7)>.
