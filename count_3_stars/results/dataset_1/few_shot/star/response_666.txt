Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 6
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 7

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are as follows:
[<0, (1, 2, 3)>, <0, (1, 5, 6)>, <0, (2, 5, 8)>, <0, (3, 5, 6)>, <6, (0, 3, 5)>, <6, (2, 5, 7)>]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
