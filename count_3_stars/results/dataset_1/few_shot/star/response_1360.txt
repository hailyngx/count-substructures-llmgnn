Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 6, and node 9

Node 3 is connected to node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 7, and node 8

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central nodes and their neighboring nodes. A 3-star graph consists of a central node connected to exactly 3 other nodes.

By looking at the adjacency list, we can identify the 3-stars. Let's list them:

<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<0, (2, 6, 9)>
<2, (0, 1, 5)>
<2, (0, 5, 6)>
<2, (0, 6, 9)>
<4, (0, 5, 8)>
<4, (5, 6, 8)>
<6, (0, 2, 7)>
<6, (2, 5, 7)>

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<0, (2, 6, 9)>
<2, (0, 1, 5)>
<2, (0, 5, 6)>
<2, (0, 6, 9)>
<4, (0, 5, 8)>
<4, (5, 6, 8)>
<6, (0, 2, 7)>
<6, (2, 5, 7)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
