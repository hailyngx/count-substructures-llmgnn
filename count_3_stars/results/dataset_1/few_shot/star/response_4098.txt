Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 6, and node 7

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star structures in the graph. 
A 3-star is formed when a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph: 
<0, (3, 7, 9)>
<1, (3, 5, 6)>
<3, (0, 1, 4)>
<5, (1, 4, 6)>
<6, (1, 5, 9)>
<8, (2, 3, 9)>
<9, (6, 7, 8)>

Counting the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we have a total of [7].
