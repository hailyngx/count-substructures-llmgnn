Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 8

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are: <0, (5, 6, 9)>, <2, (4, 6, 8)>, and <6, (5, 7, 8)>.
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
