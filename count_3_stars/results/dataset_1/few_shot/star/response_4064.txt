Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars present in the graph. A 3-star is formed when a center node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Based on the given adjacency list and the definition of a 3-star, we can identify the following unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 4, 8)>
<1, (0, 4, 8)>
<2, (1, 7, 8)>
<4, (1, 6, 7)>
<5, (6, 8, 9)>
<6, (1, 4, 5)>
<7, (1, 2, 4)>
<8, (0, 1, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
