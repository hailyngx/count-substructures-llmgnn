Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 6
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 8

Response:
There are 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

The 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 3, 6)>
<6, (0, 1, 2)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
