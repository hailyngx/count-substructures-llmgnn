Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 6

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 
A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 
Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (3, 5, 8)>
<0, (3, 8, 9)>
<1, (3, 6, 8)>
<1, (3, 8, 9)>
<6, (1, 2, 4)>
<6, (1, 4, 9)>
<8, (0, 1, 2)>
<9, (0, 1, 3)>

There are a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
