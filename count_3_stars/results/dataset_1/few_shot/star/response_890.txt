Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 2) (6, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 6

Response:
First, let's identify all 3-stars in the given graph. 
A 3-star requires a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we see that the possible center nodes could be: 1, 2, 3, 4, and 9. 

Let's analyze these possibilities:
- For node 1: {(1, 0, 5), (1, 2, 5), (1, 9, 5)}
- For node 2: {(2, 1, 3), (2, 1, 6)}
- For node 3: {(3, 2, 9), (3, 8, 9)}
- For node 4: {(4, 8, 9)}
- For node 9: {(9, 1, 4), (9, 3, 4), (9, 3, 6), (9, 1, 6)}

So, the unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<1, (0, 5, 2)>
<1, (2, 5, 9)>
<2, (1, 3, 6)>
<3, (2, 9, 8)>
<4, (8, 9, 4)>
<9, (1, 4, 6)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
