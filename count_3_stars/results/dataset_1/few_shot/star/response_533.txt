Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all the unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through each node to identify the 3-stars:

1. **Node 0** is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 4:
    - <0, (1, 3, 4)>
    
2. **Node 1** is connected to nodes 0 and 3, but does not form a 3-star.

3. **Node 2** is connected to nodes 6, but does not form a 3-star.

4. **Node 3** is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 7:
    - <3, (0, 1, 7)>
    
5. **Node 4** is connected to node 0, but does not form a 3-star.

6. **Node 5** is not connected to any other nodes.

7. **Node 6** is connected to nodes 2, 7, and 8:
    - <6, (2, 7, 8)>

8. **Node 7** is connected to nodes 3, 6, and 8:
    - <7, (3, 6, 8)>

9. **Node 8** is connected to nodes 6 and 7, but does not form a 3-star.

10. **Node 9** is not connected to any other nodes.

Counting the unique 3-stars found: [<0, (1, 3, 4)>, <3, (0, 1, 7)>, <6, (2, 7, 8)>, <7, (3, 6, 8)>], the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
