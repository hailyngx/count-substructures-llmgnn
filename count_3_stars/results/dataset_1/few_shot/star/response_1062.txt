Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 4) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes. We can start by looking at the nodes that have exactly 3 neighbors.

Nodes with exactly 3 neighbors:
- Node 0 (nodes 1, 2, 9)
- Node 3 (nodes 1, 9)
- Node 8 (nodes 1, 2, 4)

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (1, 2, 9)>
<3, (1, 9)>
<8, (1, 2, 4)>

Counting the unique 3-stars found, we get a total of [3].  
Therefore, the final answer is [3].
