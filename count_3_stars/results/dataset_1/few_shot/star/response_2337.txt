Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 8

Response:
Based on the given graph, we can see the following 3-stars: 

<1, (3, 7, 8)>
<3, (1, 5, 7)>
<7, (1, 3, 4)>
<8, (3, 5, 9)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we find a total of [4].
