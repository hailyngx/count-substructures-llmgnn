Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 7, and node 8

Response:
