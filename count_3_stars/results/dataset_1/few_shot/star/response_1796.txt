Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, 7, and node 8

Response:
Let's start by identifying the 3-stars in the given graph:

- For Node 0: Doesn't form a 3-star.
- For Node 1: Forms a 3-star with nodes (2, 3, 6).
- For Node 2: Forms a 3-star with nodes (0, 1, 3).
- For Node 3: Forms a 3-star with nodes (1, 2, 9).
- For Node 4: Forms a 3-star with nodes (0, 6, 9).
- For Node 5: Doesn't form a 3-star.
- For Node 6: Forms a 3-star with nodes (4, 1, 9).
- For Node 7: Doesn't form a 3-star.
- For Node 8: Forms a 3-star with nodes (2, 4, 5).
- For Node 9: Forms a 3-star with nodes (2, 4, 6), (3, 6, 1), (4, 6, 8), and (6, 8, 1).

Therefore, the list of unique 3-stars in this graph is:
<1, (2, 3, 6)>, <2, (0, 1, 3)>, <3, (1, 2, 9)>, <4, (0, 6, 9)>, <6, (4, 1, 9)>, <8, (2, 4, 5)>, <9, (2, 4, 6)>, <9, (3, 6, 1)>, <9, (4, 6, 8)>, <9, (6, 8, 1)>

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
