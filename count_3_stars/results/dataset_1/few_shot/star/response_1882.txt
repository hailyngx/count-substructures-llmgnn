Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 6, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star-like configuration. Let's find and list these 3-stars:

<0, (2, 8, 9)>
<1, (6, 7, 9)>
<2, (0, 8, 9)>
<3, (4, 9, 6)>
<4, (3, 5, 9)>
<6, (1, 9, 7)>
<7, (1, 9, 6)>
<8, (0, 2, 9)>
<9, (3, 6, 7)>

[The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 9.]
