Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph step by step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 7. This forms a 3-star: <0, (3, 4, 7)>

2. Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 8. This forms a 3-star: <2, (4, 5, 8)>

3. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 7. This forms a 3-star: <3, (0, 4, 7)>

4. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3. This forms a 3-star: <4, (0, 2, 3)>

5. Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 7. This forms a 3-star: <5, (2, 4, 7)>

6. Node 6 is not part of any 3-star as it has more than 3 connections.

7. Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 5. This forms a 3-star: <7, (0, 3, 5)>

8. Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 6. This forms a 3-star: <8, (2, 3, 6)>

9. Node 9 is not part of any 3-star as it has only 2 connections.

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [6]. 

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (3, 4, 7)>
<2, (4, 5, 8)>
<3, (0, 4, 7)>
<4, (0, 2, 3)>
<5, (2, 4, 7)>
<7, (0, 3, 5)>
