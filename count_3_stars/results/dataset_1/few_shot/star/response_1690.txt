Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 8

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0 forms a 3-star with leaves 1, 6, and 7: <0, (1, 6, 7)>
2. Node 1 forms a 3-star with leaves 0, 4, and 9: <1, (0, 4, 9)>
3. Node 4 forms a 3-star with leaves 1, 3, and 5: <4, (1, 3, 5)>
4. Node 5 forms a 3-star with leaves 1, 7, and 9: <5, (1, 7, 9)>
5. Node 7 forms a 3-star with leaves 0, 4, and 5: <7, (0, 4, 5)>
6. Node 9 forms a 3-star with leaves 1, 5, and 8: <9, (1, 5, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
