Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 5

Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 3

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first identify the central node for each 3-star in the graph. Then, we find the three nodes adjacent to each central node to form the 3-stars.

Let's go step by step:

1. Identify the central node and its adjacent nodes:
- For Node 0: (0, 5, 7, 8)
- For Node 1: (1, 4, 6, 9)
- For Node 2: (2, 3, 8)
- For Node 3: (3, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9)
- For Node 4: (4, 1, 3, 5, 6)
- For Node 5: (5, 0, 4, 6, 7)
- For Node 6: (6, 1, 3, 4, 5)
- For Node 7: (7, 0, 3, 5)
- For Node 8: (8, 0, 2)
- For Node 9: (9, 1, 3)

2. Count the number of 3-stars for each central node:
- For Node 0: 1
- For Node 1: 1
- For Node 2: 0
- For Node 3: 1
- For Node 4: 0
- For Node 5: 0
- For Node 6: 0
- For Node 7: 0
- For Node 8: 0
- For Node 9: 0

3. Count the total number of 3-stars in the graph: [3]

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].

Unique 3-stars found: 
<0, (5, 7, 8)>
<1, (4, 6, 9)>
<3, (2, 4, 6)>
