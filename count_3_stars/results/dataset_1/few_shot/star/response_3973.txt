Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 2

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node and its three leaves connected to it.

Here are the 3-stars in the graph:
<[0, 2, 5, 7]> - Center node: 0, Leaves: 2, 5, 7
<[1, 2, 8, 9]> - Center node: 1, Leaves: 2, 8, 9

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
