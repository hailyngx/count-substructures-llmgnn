Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible configurations where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's analyze the graph based on the information provided:

Node 0 is connected to nodes 2 and 7.
Node 1 is connected to nodes 6 and 9.
Node 2 is connected to nodes 0 and 8.
Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 8, and 9.
Node 4 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 7, and 9.
Node 5 is connected to nodes 3 and 4.
Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 7, and 8.
Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 6, and 8.
Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 6, 7, and 9.
Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, and 8.

Now, let's identify the 3-star configurations:

1. There is 1 unique 3-star: <0, (2, 7, 8)>
2. There is 1 unique 3-star: <1, (6, 9, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
