Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 3) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 7

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. From the adjacency list:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, and 8.
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 7, and 8.
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 8, and 9.
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 4, 5.
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 9, 8.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in this graph are:
<0, (1, 3, 8)>
<1, (0, 7, 8)>
<2, (5, 8, 9)>
<3, (0, 4, 5)>
<7, (1, 9, 8)>

Count of 3-stars: [5]
