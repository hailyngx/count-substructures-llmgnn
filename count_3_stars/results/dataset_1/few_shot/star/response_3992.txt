Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all unique 3-stars. 

From the given graph structure, we can see that the central node of a 3-star can only be nodes with exactly 3 neighbors. Let's list those nodes and their neighbors:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors
- Node 5 has 1 neighbor
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors

From the above list, we see that nodes 3, 6, and 9 are the only nodes that have 3 neighbors, making them potential central nodes for 3-stars.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars that can be formed:
<3, (1, 4, 5)>
<3, (4, 1, 9)>
<6, (0, 2, 7)>
<6, (2, 0, 7)>
<9, (4, 7, 1)>
<9, (7, 4, 8)>

Therefore, there are a total of [6] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
