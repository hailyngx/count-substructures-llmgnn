Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 2

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star structures in the given graph:

<1, (2, 4, 5)>
<2, (1, 4, 9)>
<4, (2, 5, 7)>
<7, (4, 5, 6)>
<9, (0, 2, _)> [Note: Node 9 is missing a leaf node to form a complete 3-star.]

The number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
