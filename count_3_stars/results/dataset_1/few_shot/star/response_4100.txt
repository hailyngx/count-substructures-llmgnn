Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 6, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we can see that the possible 3-stars can be formed using the following nodes as the center: 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9. 

Now, let's identify the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<3, (1, 5, 6)>
<4, (1, 5, 9)>
<5, (3, 4, 7)>
<6, (3, 7, 9)>
<7, (5, 6, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 4)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars: [7]
