Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list them out step by step:

1. Nodes 0, 1, and 7 are connected to 2, forming a 3-star centered at node 2. <2, (0, 1, 7)>
2. Nodes 2, 6, and 8 are connected to 0, forming a 3-star centered at node 0. <0, (2, 6, 8)>
3. Nodes 2, 7, and 8 are connected to 0, forming a 3-star centered at node 0. <0, (2, 7, 8)>
4. Nodes 2, 3, and 9 are connected to 0, forming a 3-star centered at node 0. <0, (2, 3, 9)>
5. Nodes 2, 1, and 8 are connected to 0, forming a 3-star centered at node 0. <0, (2, 1, 8)>
6. Nodes 4, 8, and 9 are connected to 6, forming a 3-star centered at node 6. <6, (4, 8, 9)>
7. Nodes 4, 9, and 5 are connected to 8, forming a 3-star centered at node 8. <8, (4, 9, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
