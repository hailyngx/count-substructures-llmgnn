Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through each node and see which nodes it is connected to:

- Node 0: Connected to nodes 1, 5, 6 (3 connections)
  - <0, (1, 5, 6)>

- Node 1: Connected to nodes 0, 2, 4 (3 connections)
  - <1, (0, 2, 4)>

- Node 2: Connected to nodes 1, 4, 6 (3 connections)
  - <2, (1, 4, 6)>

- Node 4: Connected to nodes 1, 2, 5 (3 connections)
  - <4, (1, 2, 5)>

- Node 5: Connected to nodes 0, 4, 7 (3 connections)
  - <5, (0, 4, 7)>

- Node 6: Connected to nodes 0, 1, 2 (3 connections)
  - <6, (0, 1, 2)>

- Node 8: Connected to nodes 0, 2, 5 (3 connections)
  - <8, (0, 2, 5)>

- Node 9: Connected to nodes 6, 8 (2 connections), not a 3-star

Therefore, the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [7].
