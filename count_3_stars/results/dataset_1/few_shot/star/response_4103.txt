Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 5

Response:
First, let's find the nodes that can act as the center of a 3-star in this graph. Since a 3-star has one central node and three leaves, we are looking for nodes that have exactly three neighbors.

From the given adjacency list, we can see that the nodes with exactly three neighbors are nodes 0, 1, 6, 8, and 5.

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph using each of these nodes as the central node.

Starting with node 0:
Node 0: (1, 3, 4) <1, (3, 4, 0)> [1]
Node 0: (1, 4, 4) <0, (1, 4, 2)> [2]
Node 0: (3, 0, 4) <3, (7, 9, 0)> [3]

Moving on to node 1:
Node 1: (0, 0, 4) <1, (0, 4, 2)> [4]

Next, considering node 6:
Node 6: (2, 2, 7) <6, (4, 7, 8)> [5]

Then, looking at node 8:
Node 8: (4, 4, 7) <8, (0, 7, 2)> [6]

Finally, exploring node 5:
Node 5: (9, 9, 9) <5, (3, 4, 2)> [7]

By listing the unique 3-stars found, the total count of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
