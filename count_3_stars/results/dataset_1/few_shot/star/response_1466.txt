Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 
From the adjacency list, we can see that the nodes with three connections are:
- Node 1: Connected to nodes 2, 4, and 5
- Node 4: Connected to nodes 1, 3, and 5

We can form the following 3-stars from the information above:
- <1, (2, 4, 5)>
- <4, (1, 3, 5)>

Counting the total number of unique 3-stars, we find that there are [2] 3-stars in the given graph.
