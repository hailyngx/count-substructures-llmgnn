Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to understand that a 3-star consists of a center node connected to three other nodes. 

Looking at the given graph and adjacency list, we observe that the possible 3-stars can be formed around each node with exactly three edges emanating from it. Let's identify the 3-stars for each such node:

<1, (2, 3, 4)>
<4, (1, 6, 8)>
<8, (4, 6, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
