Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star configuration. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

From the given edges and adjacency list, the 3-star configurations are as follows:
<0, (2, 4, 8)>
<1, (2, 5, 7)>
<4, (0, 5, 7)>
<7, (1, 4, 9)>
<9, (1, 5, 7)>

Therefore, there are [5] unique 3-stars in the graph.
