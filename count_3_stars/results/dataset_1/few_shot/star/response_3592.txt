Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 7
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 6

Response:
Based on the given information, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. <1, (2, 8, 9)>
2. <2, (0, 1, 7)>
3. <4, (1, 6, 8)>
4. <5, (7, 8, -)>
5. <6, (4, 9, -)>

Therefore, there are a total of [5] 3-stars in the graph.
