Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 6
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 3

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to understand what constitutes a 3-star. In this case, a 3-star is formed by a central node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Now, we will determine the number of 3-stars in the graph by looking at each node and its adjacent nodes to see if they form a 3-star. 

Upon analyzing the graph provided, we find that the 3-stars in the graph are:
[2]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1]. 

<2, (4, 3, 6)>
