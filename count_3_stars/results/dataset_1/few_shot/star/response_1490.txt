Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 8

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph based on the definition given.

Since a 3-star graph consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can look for nodes in the graph that satisfy this condition.

By examining the adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (2, 5, 6)>
<1, (3, 8, 0)>
<3, (1, 5, 7)>
<7, (3, 4, 8)>

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars in the graph and provide the final answer inside brackets:
[4]

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (2, 5, 6)>
<1, (3, 8, 0)>
<3, (1, 5, 7)>
<7, (3, 4, 8)>
