Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step by step to identify each 3-star in the graph:

1. Node 0 forms one 3-star: <0, (2, 4)>
2. Node 1 forms one 3-star: <1, (2, 6, 8)>
3. Node 3 forms one 3-star: <3, (4, 5, 7)>
4. Node 7 forms one 3-star: <7, (3, 4, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
