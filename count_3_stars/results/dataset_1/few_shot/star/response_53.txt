Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 6, and node 8
