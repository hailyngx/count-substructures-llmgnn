Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 9) (6, 8) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 4, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will look for all occurrences where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's examine the graph step by step:

- Node 0, Node 1, and Node 2 do not form 3-stars since they are not connected to exactly 3 other nodes.
- Node 3, Node 4, Node 6, and Node 7 are not central nodes as they have more or fewer than 3 edges.
- Node 5 is not involved in any edges so it does not form a 3-star.

Now, let's focus on nodes 8 and 9 since they have multiple connections and can potentially form 3-stars:

- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 6, 7, and 9. Since Node 8 has exactly 3 edges (with nodes 0, 6, and 7), it can form a 3-star with these nodes.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, and 8. Since Node 9 has exactly 3 edges (with nodes 1, 2, and 3), it can form a 3-star with these nodes.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is 2.
