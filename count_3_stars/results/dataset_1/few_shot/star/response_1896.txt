Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (7, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

From the provided information, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:
1. <0, (5, 4, 7)>
2. <2, (3, 9, 8)>
3. <4, (5, 8, 0)>
4. <8, (4, 9, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4]. 

The unique 3-stars found are <0, (5, 4, 7)>, <2, (3, 9, 8)>, <4, (5, 8, 0)>, and <8, (4, 9, 2)>.
