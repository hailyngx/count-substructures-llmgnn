Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 7

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star structures in the given graph:
- Node 1: (1, 7) forms a 3-star with central node 1 and leaves 7, 4, and 2. 
- Node 3: (3, 4) forms a 3-star with central node 3 and leaves 4, 7, and 5.
- Node 5: (5, 3) forms a 3-star with central node 5 and leaves 3, 6, and 7.
- Node 7: (7, 1) forms a 3-star with central node 7 and leaves 1, 3, and 4.
- Node 7: (7, 9) forms a 3-star with central node 7 and leaves 9, 2, and 1 (Note: this relation was incorrectly stated in the adjacency list, the corrected relation is (1, 7) (7, 9)).

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are:
<1, (7, 4, 2)>
<3, (4, 7, 5)>
<5, (3, 6, 7)>
<7, (1, 3, 4)>
<7, (9, 2, 1)>

Counting the number of 3-stars, we find that there are [5] 3-stars in total.
