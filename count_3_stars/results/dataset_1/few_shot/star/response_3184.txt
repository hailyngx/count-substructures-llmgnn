Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (4, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 1

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify the nodes with exactly three neighbors (leaves) connected to them:

- Node 0 has 6 neighbors (1, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9)
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors (0, 2, 8, 9)
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors (2, 6, 7, 8)

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:
1. For node 0:
   - <0, (1, 6, 7)>
   - <0, (1, 8, 9)>

2. For node 1:
   - <1, (0, 8, 9)>

3. For node 5:
   - <5, (2, 6, 7)>
   - <5, (2, 7, 8)>
   - <5, (6, 7, 8)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in this graph: [5]
