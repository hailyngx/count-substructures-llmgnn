Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 4

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph.

1. Node 0: Connected to nodes 1, 2, 5, 6, and 8
   - 3-star: <0, (1, 2, 6)>
   
2. Node 1: Connected to nodes 0 and 6
   - 3-star: <1, (0, 6, 7)>
   
3. Node 2: Connected to nodes 0 and 5
   - No 3-star
   
4. Node 3: Connected to node 7
   - No 3-star
   
5. Node 4: Connected to node 9
   - No 3-star
   
6. Node 5: Connected to nodes 0, 2, and 7
   - 3-star: <5, (0, 2, 7)>
   
7. Node 6: Connected to nodes 0 and 1
   - No 3-star
   
8. Node 7: Connected to nodes 1, 3, and 5
   - 3-star: <7, (1, 3, 5)>
   
9. Node 8: Connected to node 0
   - No 3-star
   
10. Node 9: Connected to node 4
    - No 3-star

Therefore, there are a total of [3] 3-stars in the given graph.
