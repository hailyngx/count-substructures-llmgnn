Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 4, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 5

Response:
Given the information provided, we need to identify the 3-stars in the graph. 

Let's start by looking at each node:
- Node 0: <0, (3, 5, 9)>
- Node 1: <1, (3, 4, 5)> 
- Node 2: <2, (3, 5, 6)>
- Node 3: <3, (0, 1, 2)>, <3, (1, 4, 9)>
- Node 4: <4, (1, 3, 8)>
- Node 5: <5, (0, 1, 2)>, <5, (0, 1, 9)>
- Node 6: <6, (1, 2)>
- Node 8: <8, (1, 2, 4)>
- Node 9: <9, (0, 1, 3)>, <9, (0, 1, 5)>

By listing out the unique 3-stars found, we have:
<0, (3, 5, 9)>, <1, (3, 4, 5)>, <2, (3, 5, 6)>, <3, (0, 1, 2)>, <3, (1, 4, 9)>, <4, (1, 3, 8)>, <5, (0, 1, 2)>, <5, (0, 1, 9)>, <6, (1, 2)>, <8, (1, 2, 4)>, <9, (0, 1, 3)>, <9, (0, 1, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is: [12].
