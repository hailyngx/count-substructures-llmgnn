Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 8

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Since the 3-stars consist of a central node and three leaves, we will look for nodes that have exactly 3 neighbors.

2. From the adjacency list:
   - Nodes 0, 1, and 4 do not have exactly 3 neighbors.
   - Node 2 has 3 neighbors (3, 6, 9).
   - Node 3 has 4 neighbors (2, 5, 6, 7).
   - Node 5 has 3 neighbors (3, 4, 6).
   - Node 8 has 3 neighbors (1, 7, 9).
   - Node 9 has 3 neighbors (1, 2, 8).

3. Now, let's list the 3-stars based on the found central nodes:
   - <2, (3, 6, 9)>
   - <5, (3, 4, 6)>
   - <8, (1, 7, 9)>
   - <9, (1, 2, 8)>

4. Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we have counted each only once:
   - [4]
