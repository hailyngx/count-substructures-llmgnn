Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 10 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (5, 2) (6, 2) (8, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 2
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 2
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are:
<2, (0, 5, 6)>
<2, (0, 6, 8)>
<2, (0, 5, 8)>
<2, (5, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
