Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes (forming a 3-star pattern).

Here are the 3-stars in the given graph:
<0, (3, 6, 9)>
<1, (4, 7, 9)>
<2, (8, 6, 9)>
<3, (0, 4, 5)>
<3, (0, 6, 9)>
<4, (1, 7, 9)>
<6, (0, 8, 9)>
<9, (2, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
