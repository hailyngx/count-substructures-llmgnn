Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 7
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify all the possible configurations where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the given graph, we can count the 3-stars as follows:

1. <0, (1, 3, 5)>
2. <1, (0, 3, 5)>
3. <5, (0, 1, 7)>
4. <7, (0, 4, 5)>
5. <8, (1, 3, 9)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
