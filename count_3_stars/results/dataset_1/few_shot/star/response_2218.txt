Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 2

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern. Let's go step by step:

1. Check each node to see if it is connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 5, 7, and 9. This forms a 3-star with Node 1 as the center and nodes 5, 7, and 9 as leaves. <1, (5, 7, 9)>
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 4. This forms another 3-star with Node 7 as the center and nodes 1, 3, and 4 as leaves. <7, (1, 3, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
