Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 5, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars present. 

Based on the definition provided, a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through the list of nodes and their connections to find all unique 3-stars:

1. <0, (3, 9)>
2. <1, (5, 8, 9)>
3. <4, (6, 9)>
4. <5, (1, 2, 8)>
5. <9, (0, 1, 4)>
6. <9, (1, 4, 5)>
7. <9, (4, 5, 7)>

Count of 3-stars: [7]
