Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (5, 6, 8)>
<0, (5, 6, 9)>
<0, (5, 8, 9)>
<0, (6, 8, 9)>
<2, (1, 4, 6)>
<2, (1, 6, 9)>
<2, (4, 6, 9)>
<8, (0, 2, 3)>
<9, (1, 6, 7)>

Counting the unique 3-stars found, we get a total of [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
