Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the possible 3-stars based on the definition provided. 

Given that a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can examine each node and its adjacent nodes to see if they form 3-stars.

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (2, 5, 6)>
<0, (2, 5, 8)>
<0, (2, 5, 9)>
<0, (5, 6, 7)>
<2, (0, 4, 5)>
<2, (0, 5, 9)>
<4, (2, 7, 9)>
<5, (0, 2, 6)>
<5, (0, 6, 7)>
<5, (2, 6, 7)>
<5, (6, 7, 9)>
<6, (0, 5, 7)>
<6, (5, 7, 9)>
<7, (4, 5, 6)>
<7, (5, 6, 9)>
<8, (0, 3, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [16].
