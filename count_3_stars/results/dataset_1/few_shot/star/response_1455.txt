Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible 3-star configurations. Since a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can search for nodes that satisfy this structure.

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (2, 5, 8)>
<0, (2, 8, 9)>
<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<2, (0, 1, 8)>
<2, (0, 1, 9)>
<2, (1, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 2, 9)>
<9, (0, 2, 7)>
<9, (0, 2, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
