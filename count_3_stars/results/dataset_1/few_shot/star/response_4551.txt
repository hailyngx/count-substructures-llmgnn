Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible combinations of nodes that form 3-stars. Since a 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes, we will look for nodes that meet this condition. 

Looking at the adjacency list and the provided edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:

<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<4, (1, 2, 3)>
<7, (0, 2, 5)>

There are a total of [4] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
