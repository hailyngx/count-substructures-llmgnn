Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 7
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 3

Response:
The center node of a 3-star must have a degree of 3, and the leaves must have a degree of 1 each. Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- Node 0 is a center node with leaves 6, 7, and 8. (<0, (6, 7, 8)>)
- Node 1 is a center node with leaves 6, 7, and 8. (<1, (6, 7, 8)>)
- Node 3 is a center node with leaves 2, 7, and 8. (<3, (2, 7, 8)>)
- Node 7 is a center node with leaves 0, 1, and 3. (<7, (0, 1, 3)>)
- Node 8 is a center node with leaves 0, 1, and 2. (<8, (0, 1, 2)>)

Therefore, there are a total of [5] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
