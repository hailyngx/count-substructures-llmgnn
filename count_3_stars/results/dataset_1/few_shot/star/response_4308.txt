Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's determine the 3-stars:

1. Node 1: (1, 2, 4), (1, 6, 9)
2. Node 2: (2, 0, 3), (2, 1, 5)
3. Node 3: (3, 0, 5), (3, 2, 9)
4. Node 6: (6, 1, 7), (6, 7, 9)
5. Node 8: (8, 3, 9)

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
  
Unique 3-stars found: 
<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<1, (6, 9, 2)>
<2, (3, 0, 2)>
<2, (1, 5, 2)>
<3, (5, 0, 3)>
<3, (2, 9, 3)>
<6, (7, 1, 6)>
<6, (9, 7, 6)>
<8, (3, 9, 8)>
