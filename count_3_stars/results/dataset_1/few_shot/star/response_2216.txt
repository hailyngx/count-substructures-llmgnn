Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 5, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a 3-star pattern. 

Let's go through each node to identify the 3-stars:

- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 5, and 8. This forms a 3-star <1, (2, 4, 5)>.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 7. This forms a 3-star <2, (1, 3, 7)>.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 7. This forms a 3-star <4, (1, 5, 7)>.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 9. This forms a 3-star <5, (1, 4, 9)>.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2 and 4. This node does not form a 3-star since it is only connected to 2 other nodes.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1 and 9. This node does not form a 3-star since it is only connected to 2 other nodes.
- Node 3, 6, and 0 are not part of any 3-star patterns.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is simply the count of unique 3-stars we found, which is 4.

Therefore, the final answer is [4].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (2, 4, 5)>, <2, (1, 3, 7)>, <4, (1, 5, 7)>, <5, (1, 4, 9)>.
