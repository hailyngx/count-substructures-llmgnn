Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 3
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 6

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are as follows:
<0, (2, 8, 9)>
<1, (3, 8, )>
<2, (0, 6, )>
<3, (1, 4, 7)>
<6, (2, 9, )>
<7, (3, 8, )>
<8, (0, 1, 7)>
<9, (0, 6, )>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
