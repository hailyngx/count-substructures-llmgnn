Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will serve as the center of the 3-star.

Upon examining the graph and adjacency list, we can identify the following potential 3-stars:
- Node 1 connected to nodes 2, 4, 6
- Node 3 connected to nodes 4, 5, 7
- Node 7 connected to nodes 1, 6, 8

However, Node 1 is connected to 5 nodes, so it does not form a 3-star. Therefore, the valid 3-stars in the graph are:
<3, (4, 5, 7)>
<7, (1, 6, 8)>

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
