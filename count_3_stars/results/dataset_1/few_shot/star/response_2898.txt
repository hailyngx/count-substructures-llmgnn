Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 4

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star structures in the graph. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we can determine the following 3-star structures:
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<1, (2, 3, 4)>
<3, (1, 4, 6)>
<3, (4, 8, 9)>
<4, (0, 2, 8)>
<4, (1, 3, 9)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we find a total of [6].
