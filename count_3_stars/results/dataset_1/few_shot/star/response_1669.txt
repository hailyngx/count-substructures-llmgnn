Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 4, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 5
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 8

Response:
Since a 3-star graph consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can identify them in the given graph. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we can see that the nodes with 3 connections are:
- Node 0 (connected to nodes 1, 4, and 5)
- Node 4 (connected to nodes 0, 5, and 9)
- Node 5 (connected to nodes 0, 4, and 6)
- Node 9 (connected to nodes 1, 4, and 8)

Let's find all the 3-stars in the graph. 

The number of 3-stars is [2]. 

<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<4, (0, 5, 9)>
