Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to find all possible 3-stars by identifying the central node and its 3 connected nodes. 

Given the adjacency list, we can see the connections for each node. Let's analyze each node to find the 3-stars:

#### For Node 0:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 9. Therefore, Node 0 can form 1 3-star.

#### For Node 1:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2 and 9. However, it does not have 3 connections, so it cannot form any 3-stars.

#### For Node 2:
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 9. Therefore, Node 2 can form 4 3-stars: <2, (1, 4, 9)>, <2, (3, 4, 5)>, <2, (5, 7, 9)>, <2, (1, 5, 7)>.

#### For Node 3:
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. Therefore, Node 3 can form 4 3-stars: <3, (2, 4, 6)>, <3, (4, 5, 7)>, <3, (5, 6, 8)>, <3, (2, 7, 8)>.

#### For Node 4:
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, and 6. Therefore, Node 4 can form 2 3-stars: <4, (0, 2, 6)>, <4, (2, 3, 6)>.

#### For Node 5:
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 6, 8, and 9. Therefore, Node 5 can form 1 3-star: <5, (2, 6, 8)>.

#### For Node 6:
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 8. Therefore, Node 6 can form 3 3-stars: <6, (3, 4, 5)>, <6, (4, 5, 7)>, <6, (5, 7, 8)>.

#### For Node 7:
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 6, and 8. However, it does not have 3 connections, so it cannot form any 3-stars.

#### For Node 8:
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 6, 7, and 9. Therefore, Node 8 can form 2 3-stars: <8, (3, 6, 9)>, <8, (5, 6, 9)>.

#### For Node 9:
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 5, and 8. Therefore, Node 9 can form 1 3-star: <9, (0, 2, 8)>.

To summarize, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [18].
Unique 3-stars:
<2, (1, 4, 9)>, <2, (3, 4, 5)>, <2, (5, 7, 9)>, <2, (1, 5, 7)>, <3, (2, 4, 6)>, <3, (4, 5, 7)>, <3, (5, 6, 8)>, <3, (2, 7, 8)>, <4, (0, 2, 6)>, <4, (2, 3, 6)>, <5, (2, 6, 8)>, <6, (3, 4, 5)>, <6, (4, 5, 7)>, <6, (5, 7, 8)>, <8, (3, 6, 9)>, <8, (5, 6, 9)>, <9, (0, 2, 8)>.
