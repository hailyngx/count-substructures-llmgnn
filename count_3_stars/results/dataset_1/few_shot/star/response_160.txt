Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars present. 

From the definition of a 3-star graph, we know that a 3-star consists of a center node connected to three other nodes. 

Looking at the provided information, we can identify the 3-stars present in the graph:

<1, (5, 7, 8)>
<4, (6, 8, 9)>
<5, (1, 8, -)>
<7, (1, 3, -)>
<8, (1, 4 ,5)>
<9, (6, 8, -)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph.
