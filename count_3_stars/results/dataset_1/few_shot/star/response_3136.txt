Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 9) (7, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 9
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. These instances will represent 3-stars with a central node connected to three leaves.

By examining the adjacency list for each node, we can identify the following unique 3-stars:

<0, (1, 2, 9)>
<1, (0, 2, 9)>
<2, (0, 1, 8)>
<3, (4, 8, 9)>
<4, (3, 8, 9)>
<8, (2, 3, 4)>
<9, (0, 1, 2)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we find that there are [7] 3-stars in the given graph.
