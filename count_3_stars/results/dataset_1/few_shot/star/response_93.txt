Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 6
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 2

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the given graph based on the definition provided. 

1. For Node 0:
   - 3-star: <0, (5, 7, 1)>

2. For Node 2:
   - 3-star: <2, (5, 6, 8)>
   - 3-star: <2, (5, 8, 9)>

3. For Node 5:
   - 3-star: <5, (0, 2, 8)>

4. For Node 6:
   - 3-star: <6, (2, 3, 7)>

After listing all the 3-stars found, we can count them to get the total number of 3-stars in the given graph. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [4].
