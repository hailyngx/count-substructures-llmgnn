Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 4

Response:
Great! Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
1. Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 4, and 9. <0, (2, 4, 9)>
2. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 5, and 6. <1, (2, 5, 6)>
3. Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 2, and 9. <4, (0, 2, 9)>
4. Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 7, and 8. <5, (1, 7, 8)>
5. Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, and 7. <6, (1, 3, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
