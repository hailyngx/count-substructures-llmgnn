Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 2

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible sets of nodes where one node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through each node and its connections:

1. Node 0: Forms 2 different 3-stars
   - <0, (5, 6, 7)>
   - <0, (5, 7, 9)>

2. Node 1: Forms 0 3-stars

3. Node 2: Forms 0 3-stars

4. Node 3: Forms 1 3-star
   - <3, (2, 5, 7)>

5. Node 4: Forms 1 3-star
   - <4, (1, 6, 5)>

6. Node 5: Forms 3 different 3-stars
   - <5, (0, 1, 3)>
   - <5, (0, 3, 7)>
   - <5, (1, 6, 7)>

7. Node 6: Forms 1 3-star
   - <6, (0, 5, 7)>

8. Node 7: Forms 2 different 3-stars
   - <7, (0, 5, 3)>
   - <7, (0, 5, 6)>

9. Node 8: Forms 0 3-stars

10. Node 9: Forms 0 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10]. 

So, the unique 3-stars found are: <0, (5, 6, 7)>, <0, (5, 7, 9)>, <3, (2, 5, 7)>, <4, (1, 6, 5)>, <5, (0, 1, 3)>, <5, (0, 3, 7)>, <5, (1, 6, 7)>, <6, (0, 5, 7)>, <7, (0, 5, 3)>, <7, (0, 5, 6)>.
