Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 8

Response:
The nodes with their connections: 
- Node 1: {3, 8}
- Node 2: {3, 4, 5}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 5, 8}
- Node 4: {2, 5}
- Node 5: {2, 3, 4, 8}
- Node 6: {}
- Node 7: {}
- Node 8: {1, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 9: {8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph: 
- Total 3-stars found: [6]
- Unique 3-stars: 
<1, (3, 8)>
<2, (3, 4, 5)>
<3, (1, 2, 8)>
<3, (2, 5, 8)>
<5, (2, 3, 4)>
<8, (1, 3, 5)>
