Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 3

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are as follows:
<0, (3, 8, 9)>
<1, (3, 7, -)>
<2, (5, -, -)>
<3, (0, 1, 4)>
<3, (0, 5, 9)>
<4, (3, 7, -)>
<5, (2, 3, 6)>
<6, (5, 7, 8)>
<7, (1, 4, -)>
<7, (6, 8, -)>
<8, (0, 6, 7)>
<9, (0, 3, -)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
