Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 4

Response:
Given the graph described, let's identify the 3-star subgraphs:

- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 4, and 7: <0, (1, 4, 7)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 8, and 0: <2, (6, 8, 0)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 8, 9, and 0: <4, (8, 9, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
