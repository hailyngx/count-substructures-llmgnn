Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 6

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 6, and 7. This creates a 3-star <1, (3, 6, 7)>.
2. Node 4 is connected to nodes 5 and 9. This creates a 3-star <4, (5, 9)>.
3. Node 5 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 9. This creates a 3-star <5, (4, 6, 9)>.
4. Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 7. This creates a 3-star <6, (1, 5, 7)>.

Count of 3-stars: [4]
Unique 3-stars: <<1, (3, 6, 7)>, <4, (5, 9)>, <5, (4, 6, 9)>, <6, (1, 5, 7)>]
