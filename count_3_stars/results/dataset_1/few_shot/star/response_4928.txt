Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each possible 3-star configuration, where one node is at the center and the other three nodes are connected to the center node.

The adjacency list provided gives us a good understanding of the connections each node has. Let's identify the 3-stars step by step:

1. Node 0: <0, (1, 3, 8)>
2. Node 1: <1, (0, 3, 8)>
3. Node 2: <2, (1, 4, 7)>
4. Node 3: <3, (0, 1, 4)>
5. Node 4: <4, (1, 2, 7)>
6. Node 7: <7, (2, 3, 4)>
7. Node 9: <9, (0, 1, 7)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars found above, we get a total of [7].
