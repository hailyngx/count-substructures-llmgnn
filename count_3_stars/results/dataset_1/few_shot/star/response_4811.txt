Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a 3-star pattern.

Looking at the adjacency list, we can see that only nodes 0, 1, and 6 have edges to exactly three other nodes.

Therefore, the 3-stars in this graph are:
<0, (7, 8, 6)>
<1, (3, 9, 6)>
<6, (3, 4, 7)>

Count of 3-stars: [3]
