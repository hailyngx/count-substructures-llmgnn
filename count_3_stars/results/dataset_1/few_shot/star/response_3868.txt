Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 3

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be found by counting the number of triangles in the graph, as each triangle represents a 3-star. 

To find the triangles, we can look for nodes that have two edges connecting them. The node in the middle of those two edges forms a triangle with the two connected nodes. 

In this graph, we can identify the following 3-stars: 
<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<1, (4, 5, 6)>
<4, (0, 1, 8)>
<5, (1, 2, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
