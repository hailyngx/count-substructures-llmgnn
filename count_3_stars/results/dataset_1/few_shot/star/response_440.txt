Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern with that node as the center.

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 0: (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 5)
2. Node 3: (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5)
3. Node 4: (4, 0), (4, 3), (4, 5)
4. Node 5: (5, 0), (5, 3), (5, 4)
5. Node 8: (8, 0), (8, 1), (8, 2)
6. Node 9: (9, 3), (9, 8)

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

Unique 3-stars: 
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<3, (2, 4, 5)>
<4, (0, 3, 5)>
<5, (0, 3, 4)>
<8, (0, 1, 2)>
<9, (3, 8)>
