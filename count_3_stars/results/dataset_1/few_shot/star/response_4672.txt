Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 6

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the 3-stars by locating a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the adjacency list for each node, we can see that the only potential central nodes are nodes 0, 3, and 6. 

For node 0:
- <0, (1, 2, 3)> - Not a 3-star as it has 4 leaves instead of 3.
- <0, (1, 2, 4)> - Not a 3-star as it has 3 leaves instead of 2.
- <0, (1, 3, 9)> - Not a 3-star as it has 2 leaves instead of 3.

For node 3:
- <3, (0, 2, 4)> - This is a 3-star.

For node 6:
- <6, (4, 5, 9)> - Not a 3-star as the central node, 6, has degree 4.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1]. 
The unique 3-star found is <3, (0, 2, 4)>.
