Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to understand that a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. In this case, we will look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

From the given adjacency list, the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes are:
- Node 5 (connected to 0, 2, and 9)
- Node 7 (connected to 2, and 6)
- Node 9 (connected to 2, and 5)

Let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<5, (0, 2, 9)>
<7, (2, 6, -)>  (Note: the fourth node is missing, which we represent as '-')
<9, (2, 5, -)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we get a total of [3].
