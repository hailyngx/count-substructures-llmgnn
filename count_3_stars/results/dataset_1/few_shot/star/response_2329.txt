Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 7

Response:
Let's first identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph. 
A 3-star graph consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

In this graph, we can find the following 3-star graphs:
1. <1, (0, 3, 6)>
2. <3, (1, 2, 6)>
3. <3, (1, 6, 7)>
4. <3, (2, 6, 8)>
5. <3, (6, 7, 9)>
6. <6, (1, 3, 7)>
7. <7, (3, 6, 9)>
8. <8, (2, 3, 5)>
9. <9, (4, 7, 7)>

Therefore, there are a total of [9] 3-star graphs in the given graph.
