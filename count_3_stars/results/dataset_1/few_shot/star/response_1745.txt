Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 6

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph can be identified based on the definition provided earlier. Here is the step-by-step process to find and count the 3-stars: 

1. Identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will be the centers of the potential 3-stars. 
   - From the given information, nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 9 are connected to three other nodes each.

2. For each of these potential center nodes, check if they can form a 3-star.
   
3-stars with center node 0: (0, 1, 3, 5) and (0, 1, 3, 7)
3-stars with center node 1: (1, 0, 3, 6)
3-stars with center node 2: (2, 3, 4, 7)
3-stars with center node 3: (3, 0, 1, 2) and (3, 2, 4, 5)
3-stars with center node 4: (4, 2, 3, 5) and (4, 0, 5, 6)
3-stars with center node 5: (5, 0, 4, 7) and (5, 2, 6, 9)
3-stars with center node 7: (7, 0, 2, 5) and (7, 1, 3, 6)
3-stars with center node 9: (9, 2, 5, 6)

Thus, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [12].
Unique 3-stars found in the graph: 
<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<0, (1, 3, 7)>
<1, (0, 3, 6)>
<2, (3, 4, 7)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<3, (2, 4, 5)>
<4, (0, 5, 6)>
<5, (2, 6, 9)>
<5, (0, 4, 7)>
<7, (0, 2, 5)>
<7, (1, 3, 6)>
<9, (2, 5, 6)>
