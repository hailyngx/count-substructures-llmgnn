Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 4

Response:
We first need to identify the central node and its neighboring nodes for each potential 3-star in the graph.

Looking at the adjacency list, we can see that the nodes and their connections are as follows:
- Node 0: Neighbors 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
- Node 1: Neighbors 7, 9
- Node 2: Neighbors 0, 5
- Node 3: Neighbors 0, 4
- Node 4: Neighbors 0, 3, 7, 8, 9
- Node 5: Neighbors 0, 2
- Node 6: Neighbor 0
- Node 7: Neighbors 1, 4
- Node 8: Neighbor 4
- Node 9: Neighbors 1, 4

Let's identify the 3-stars:
1. <0, (2, 5, 6)>
2. <1, (7, 9, -)>
3. <2, (0, 5, -)>
4. <3, (0, 4, -)>
5. <4, (0, 3, 7)>
6. <4, (0, 3, 8)>
7. <4, (0, 3, 9)>
8. <4, (0, 7, 8)>
9. <4, (0, 7, 9)>

Count of 3-stars: [9]
