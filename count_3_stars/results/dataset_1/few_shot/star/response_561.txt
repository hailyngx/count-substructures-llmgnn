Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. These instances represent the 3-stars in the graph. Let's go through the nodes one by one:

- Node 0 is not part of any 3-star since it is only connected to one other node.

- Node 1 is not part of any 3-star since it is connected to two other nodes.

- Node 2 is part of a 3-star: <2, (4, 5, 6)>.

- Node 3 is not part of any 3-star since it is connected to two other nodes.

- Node 4 is part of two 3-stars: <4, (2, 5, 9)> and <4, (5, 6, 9)>.

- Node 5 is not part of any 3-star since it is only connected to one other node.

- Node 6 is part of two 3-stars: <6, (0, 8, 9)> and <6, (2, 4, 8)>.

- Node 7 is not part of any 3-star since it is connected to two other nodes.

- Node 8 is part of a 3-star: <8, (2, 6, 7)>.

- Node 9 is part of three 3-stars: <9, (1, 4, 7)>, <9, (3, 4, 7)>, and <9, (6, 7, 4)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<2, (4, 5, 6)>, 
<4, (2, 5, 9)>, 
<4, (5, 6, 9)>, 
<6, (0, 8, 9)>, 
<6, (2, 4, 8)>, 
<8, (2, 6, 7)>, 
<9, (1, 4, 7)>, 
<9, (3, 4, 7)>, 
<9, (6, 7, 4)>.
