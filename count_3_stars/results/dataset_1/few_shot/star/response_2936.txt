Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can identify the central nodes and their connections to three other nodes. 

The central nodes and their connections are as follows:
- Central node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 6.
- Central node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 6.
- Central node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 4.

Now, we will count the number of unique 3-stars in the graph:

<2, (0, 3, 6)>
<3, (2, 4, 6)>
<5, (0, 1, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
