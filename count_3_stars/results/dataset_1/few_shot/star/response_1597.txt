Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 3

Response:
Based on the given information, the 3-star graphs in the given graph are:

<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<2, (0, 6, 0)>
<5, (0, 7, 0)>
<6, (2, 8, 2)>
<7, (1, 5, 1)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
