Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 8
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 8

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph by finding nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we can see that nodes 0, 1, 5, and 8 are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes can act as the centers of the 3-stars.

Now, let's list the 3-stars in the graph: 
<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<1, (0, 4, 5)>
<1, (8, 5, 9)>
<5, (0, 3, 4)>
<8, (1, 5, 9)>

Count of 3-stars: [6]
