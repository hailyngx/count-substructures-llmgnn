Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 3

Response:
There are 3-star graphs in this network. Let's identify them one by one.

The 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 4, 7)>
<0, (3, 7, 8)>
<0, (3, 8, 9)>
<5, (2, 8, 8)>
<7, (0, 3, 6)>
<7, (3, 6, 8)>
<8, (0, 3, 6)>

So, there are a total of [7] 3-stars in the given graph.
