Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 3

Response:
The 3-star pattern is comprised of one central node and three leaf nodes connected to the central node. 

In this graph, to determine the count of 3-stars, we need to identify each node that is at the center of a 3-star and the three nodes connected to it. 

Looking at the graph, the 3-star patterns are as follows:  
<0, (3, 4, 9)>  
<1, (5, 6, -)>  
<2, (5, 8, 9)>  
<5, (1, 2, 7)>  

Hence, the count of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
