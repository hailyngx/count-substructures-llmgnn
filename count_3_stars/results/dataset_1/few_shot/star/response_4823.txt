Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 8) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. We will list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<2, (5, 7, 8)>
<3, (6, 8, 9)>
<5, (2, 9, *)>
<7, (0, 2, 9)>
<8, (2, 3, 6)>
<9, (5, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
