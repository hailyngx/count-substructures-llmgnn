Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (9, 0) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 4
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify the central node and its connected nodes for each 3-star pattern. 
Here are the 3-stars in this graph: 
[6]

[<0, (2, 7, 9)>] 

[<2, (0, 3, 5)>, <2, (0, 4, 6)>, <2, (3, 4, 5)>, <2, (4, 5, 6)>]

[<7, (0, 1, 4)>] 

[]

From the identified 3-star patterns, we can see that there are a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
