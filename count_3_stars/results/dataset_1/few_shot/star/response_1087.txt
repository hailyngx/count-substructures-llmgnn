Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 8

Response:
The center of a 3-star graph will have exactly 3 edges. Let's identify the nodes that have 3 edges connected to them:

1. **Node 1**: Connected to nodes 0, 2, and 8
2. **Node 2**: Connected to nodes 1, 4, and 6
3. **Node 8**: Connected to nodes 1, 5, and 6

Now, we can list the unique 3-stars:  
<1, (0, 2, 8)>  
<2, (1, 4, 6)>  
<8, (1, 5, 6)>

So, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is **[3]**.
