Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 0) (5, 8) (6, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 8
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 8

Response:
There are a total of [8] 3-star graphs in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 9)>
<2, (1, 9)>
<2, (9, 8)>
<9, (0, 2)>
<9, (2, 8)>
<8, (3, 5, 6)>
<8, (3, 9)>
<8, (5, 6)>
