Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 4, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern with that node as the center.

Let's go through each node and check if they form a 3-star pattern:

- For Node 0: <0, (1, 2, 7)>
- For Node 1: <1, (0, 2, 7)> and <1, (5, 8, 9)>
- For Node 2: <2, (0, 1, 9)>
- For Node 3: <3, (4, 7, 9)>
- For Node 4: <4, (3, 9, 5)>
- For Node 5: <5, (1, 9, 8)>
- For Node 6: No 3-star pattern as it is connected to only one node.
- For Node 7: <7, (0, 1, 8)> and <7, (3, 8, 9)>
- For Node 8: No 3-star pattern as it is connected to four other nodes.
- For Node 9: <9, (1, 2, 3)> and <9, (4, 5, 7)>

Combining all unique 3-stars identified: 
<0, (1, 2, 7)>, <1, (0, 2, 7)>, <1, (5, 8, 9)>, <2, (0, 1, 9)>, <3, (4, 7, 9)>, <4, (3, 9, 5)>, <5, (1, 9, 8)>, <7, (0, 1, 8)>, <7, (3, 8, 9)>, <9, (1, 2, 3)>, <9, (4, 5, 7)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [11].
