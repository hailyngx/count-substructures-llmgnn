Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 8

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the unique 3-stars present in the graph. 

Let's list the 3-stars (center node, connected nodes) based on the given graph:
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<1, (3, 6, 8)>
<2, (0, 3, 5)>
<3, (1, 2, 4)>
<4, (0, 3, 6)>
<4, (0, 4, 7)>
<4, (3, 6, 9)>
<4, (6, 7, 9)>
<5, (0, 2, _)> *Node 5 only has two connections (0 and 2).
<6, (1, 4, _)>
<7, (4, 9, _)>
<8, (1, 9, _)>
<9, (4, 7, 8)>

Count of 3-stars: [12]

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [12].
