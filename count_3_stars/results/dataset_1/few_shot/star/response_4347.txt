Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 7

Node 3 is connected to node 2, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 2

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible combinations where a node is the center of a 3-star. Let's go step by step:

1. Node 0 is not part of any 3-star since it's only connected to one node.
2. Identify 3-stars with the center being Node 1: 
   - Node 1 is connected to nodes 5 and 7. However, nodes 5 and 7 are not connected to each other, so there are no 3-stars with Node 1 as the center.
3. Identify 3-stars with the center being Node 2: 
   - From the adjacency list, Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 9. Nodes 3 and 4 are connected to each other, so a 3-star with center Node 2 exists with leaves (3, 4, 9).
4. Identify 3-stars with the center being Node 3: 
   - From the adjacency list, Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 7, and 8. Nodes 2, 5, and 8 are connected to each other, so there are 3-stars with Node 3 as the center: 
     <3, (2, 5, 8)>
5. Identify 3-stars with the center being Node 4: 
   - From the adjacency list, Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8. Nodes 2, 5, and 8 are connected to each other, so there are 3-stars with Node 4 as the center: 
     <4, (2, 5, 8)>
6. Node 5 is not part of any 3-star since it's only connected to three nodes.
7. Node 6 is not part of any 3-star since it's only connected to two nodes.
8. Identify 3-stars with the center being Node 7: 
   - From the adjacency list, Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, and 4. Nodes 1, 3, and 4 are connected to each other, so there are 3-stars with Node 7 as the center: 
     <7, (1, 3, 4)>
9. Identify 3-stars with the center being Node 8: 
   - From the adjacency list, Node 8 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 5, and 6. Nodes 3, 4, and 5 are connected to each other, so there are 3-stars with Node 8 as the center: 
     <8, (3, 4, 5)>, <8, (3, 4, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: <3, (2, 5, 8)>, <4, (2, 5, 8)>, <7, (1, 3, 4)>, <8, (3, 4, 5)>, <8, (3, 4, 6)>.
