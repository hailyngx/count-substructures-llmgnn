Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. We can see that Node 5 is connected to exactly three nodes (0, 4, 6), so it acts as the center of a 3-star. 

Therefore, there is only one 3-star in this graph with <5, (0, 4, 6)> as the unique 3-star. 

So, the final answer is [1].
