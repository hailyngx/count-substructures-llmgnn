Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 7

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph can be counted by analyzing each node's connections. 

Counting the 3-stars: 
- Node 0 forms 0 3-stars.
- Node 1 forms 0 3-stars.
- Node 2 forms 2 3-stars: <2, (3, 4, 5)> and <2, (4, 7, 8)>.
- Node 3 forms 3 3-stars: <3, (2, 4, 5)>, <3, (4, 6, 8)>, and <3, (4, 8, 9)>.
- Node 4 forms 4 3-stars: <4, (0, 1, 2)>, <4, (2, 3, 5)>, <4, (3, 6, 8)>, and <4, (6, 8, 9)>.
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star: <5, (2, 3, 8)>.
- Node 6 forms 0 3-stars.
- Node 7 forms 1 3-star: <7, (0, 2, 8)>.
- Node 8 forms 2 3-stars: <8, (3, 5, 7)> and <8, (4, 6, 7)>.
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star: <9, (3, 4, 7)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14]. 

Unique 3-stars found:
<2, (3, 4, 5)>, <2, (4, 7, 8)>, <3, (2, 4, 5)>, <3, (4, 6, 8)>, <3, (4, 8, 9)>, <4, (0, 1, 2)>, <4, (2, 3, 5)>, <4, (3, 6, 8)>, <4, (6, 8, 9)>, <5, (2, 3, 8)>, <7, (0, 2, 8)>, <8, (3, 5, 7)>, <8, (4, 6, 7)>, <9, (3, 4, 7)>
