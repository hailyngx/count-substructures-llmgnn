Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 6, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern with itself at the center. 

Looking at the adjacency list representation and the provided edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:

<0, (1, 2, 6)>
<0, (1, 2, 7)>
<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<1, (0, 2, 5)>
<1, (0, 2, 9)>
<1, (2, 5, 9)>
<2, (0, 1, 8)>
<6, (0, 8, 9)>
<7, (0, 4, 5)>
<7, (0, 5, 9)>
<8, (2, 6, 9)>
<9, (1, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
