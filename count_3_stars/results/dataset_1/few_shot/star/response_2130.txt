Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the combinations where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the adjacency list and the definition of a 3-star graph, we can identify the following unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<1, (0, 4, 8)>
<2, (0, 3, 4)>
<3, (2, 6, 7)>
<4, (0, 1, 2)>
<5, (0, 6, 9)>
<6, (3, 4, 5)>
<7, (1, 3, 7)>
<8, (1, 4, 9)>
<9, (1, 4, 8)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars: [10]
