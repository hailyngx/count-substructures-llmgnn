Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list down the 3-stars present in the graph:
<1, (3, 5, 9)> 
<2, (4, 5, 6)> 
<5, (1, 2, 6)> 
<5, (6, 7, 8)> 
<7, (0, 5, 9)> 

Counting the total number of distinct 3-stars: [5]
