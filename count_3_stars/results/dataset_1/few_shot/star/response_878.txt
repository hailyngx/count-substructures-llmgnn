Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 3

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the unique 3-stars present in the graph. Here are the steps to find them:

1. Identify all nodes that are connected to exactly 3 other nodes. These nodes are potential centers of 3-stars.
    - Nodes 0, 3, 4, and 9 are connected to exactly 3 other nodes.

2. For each potential center node, check if it forms a 3-star with its neighbors.
    - Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 8 and 9. (0, 8, 9)
    - Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 4 and 7. (3, 4, 7)
    - Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, and 3. (4, 0, 3)
    - Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 0 and 3. (9, 0, 3)

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (8, 9)>, <3, (4, 7)>, <4, (0, 3)>, <9, (0, 3)>.
