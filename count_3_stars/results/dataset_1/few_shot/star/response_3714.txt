Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 3

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern.

Based on the provided information, here is the list of unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<0, (4, 5, 8)>
<0, (4, 6, 8)>
<0, (5, 6, 8)>
<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<2, (1, 3, 7)>
<3, (2, 6, 7)>
<4, (0, 1, 7)>
<7, (2, 3, 5)>

Since there are 9 unique 3-stars in the graph, the final count of 3-stars is [9].
