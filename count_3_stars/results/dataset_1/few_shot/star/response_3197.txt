Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 2

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all possible instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars:

1. Node 0: 
   <0, (1, 2, 4)>
   <0, (1, 4, 8)>

2. Node 1:
   <1, (0, 4, 7)>
   
3. Node 2:
   No 3-stars available.

4. Node 3:
   No 3-stars available.

5. Node 4:
   <4, (0, 1, 5)>
   
6. Node 5:
   No 3-stars available.

7. Node 6:
   No 3-stars available.

8. Node 7:
   No 3-stars available.

9. Node 8:
   No 3-stars available.
   
10. Node 9:
   No 3-stars available.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
