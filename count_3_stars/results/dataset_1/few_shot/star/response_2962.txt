Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible 3-star configurations. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (1, 8, 9)>
<1, (0, 7, 9)>
<4, (2, 3, 9)>
<9, (1, 4, 6)>

Count of 3-stars: [4]
