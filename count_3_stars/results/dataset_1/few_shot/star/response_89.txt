Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 5

Response:
The given graph contains 3-star structures. 

Below are the 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (9, 2, 4)>
<1, (2, 5, 6)>
<2, (1, 7, 9)>
<4, (5, 8, 9)>
<6, (3, 5, 7)>
<7, (2, 6, 8)>
<8, (4, 7, 9)>
<9, (0, 2, 4)>
