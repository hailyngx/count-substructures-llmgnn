Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 3

Response:
The central nodes must have degree 3 and the leaves must have degree 1 (since they are only connected to the central node). Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Central node: 0, Leaves: 2, 6, 8
2. Central node: 1, Leaves: 4, 6, 8
3. Central node: 7, Leaves: 2, 4, 6

This gives a total of [3] 3-stars.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (2, 6, 8)>
<1, (4, 6, 8)>
<7, (2, 4, 6)>
