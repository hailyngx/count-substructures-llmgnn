Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the 3-stars present. 

The 3-stars in the given graph are:
<0, (6, 9)>
<1, (7, 8)>
<2, (3, 7)>
<3, (2, 6, 8)>
<4, (5, 9)>
<5, (4, 6, 7)>
<6, (0, 3, 5)>
<7, (1, 2, 5, 9)>
<8, (1, 3)>
<9, (0, 4, 7)>

Now, we need to count the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph. Let's calculate that:
