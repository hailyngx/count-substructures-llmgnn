Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 2

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes by edges. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Identify all nodes that are connected to exactly 3 other nodes:
   - Node 0 is connected to 5, 6, 7.
   - Node 1 is not connected to exactly 3 other nodes.
   - Node 2 is connected to 4, 7, 9.
   - Node 3 is connected to 1, 4, 8.
   - Node 4 is not connected to exactly 3 other nodes.
   - Node 5 is connected to 0, 1, 8.
   - Node 6 is not connected to exactly 3 other nodes.
   - Node 7 is not connected to exactly 3 other nodes.
   - Node 8 is not connected to exactly 3 other nodes.
   - Node 9 is not connected to exactly 3 other nodes.

2. Calculate the total number of 3-stars:
   - The possible 3-stars can be formed with central nodes 0, 2, and 5.

3. Count the 3-stars:
   - For node 0, possible 3-stars are with leaves 5, 6, 7. <0, (5, 6, 7)>
   - For node 2, possible 3-stars are with leaves 4, 7, 9. <2, (4, 7, 9)>
   - For node 5, possible 3-stars are with leaves 0, 1, 8. <5, (0, 1, 8)>

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3]. 
The unique 3-stars found are <0, (5, 6, 7)>, <2, (4, 7, 9)>, and <5, (0, 1, 8)>.
