Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 7

Response:
There are four 3-stars in the given graph. 

List of unique 3-stars: 
1. <0, (7, 9)>
2. <1, (4, 6, 8)>
3. <4, (1, 9, -)>
4. <7, (0, 5, 9)>
