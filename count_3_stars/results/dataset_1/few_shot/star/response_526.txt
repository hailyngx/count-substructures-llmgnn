Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 5

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star patterns in the given graph:

- Node 0 forms a 3-star: <0, (6, 7)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (4, 6, 7)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star: <4, (1, 2, 9)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star: <5, (3, 4, 9)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star: <8, (2, 3, 6)>
  
Therefore, there are a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
