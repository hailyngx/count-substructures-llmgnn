Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 6, and node 7

Response:
Given the graph information, we can count the number of 3-stars. 
Let's identify the 3-stars one by one using the definition provided in the beginning. 

1. Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 7, and 8: <0, (6, 7, 8)>
2. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 7, and 9: <1, (6, 7, 9)>
3. Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 7, and 8: <3, (2, 7, 8)>
4. Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, and 9: <7, (0, 1, 9)>
5. Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, and 6: <8, (0, 1, 6)>
6. Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 4, and 6: <9, (1, 4, 6)>

Now, we have identified all the unique 3-stars in the given graph. By counting these, we get a total of [6] 3-stars.
