Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 3

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph. 
A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Based on the given information, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (1, 4, 1)>
<1, (0, 4, 8)>
<3, (7, 9, 7)>

Therefore, there are [3] 3-stars in the given graph.
