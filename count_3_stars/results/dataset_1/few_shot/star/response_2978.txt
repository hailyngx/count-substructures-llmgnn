Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 8

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are part of the 3-star configurations. These nodes have exactly three edges connected to them. 
Based on the adjacency list provided:
- Node 0, 4, 5 are not part of any 3-star configuration since they have less than three edges.
- Nodes 1, 3 have three edges but not in the right configuration for a 3-star.
- Nodes 2, 7, 8, 9 are part of potential 3-star configurations.

Next, let's analyze each potential 3-star. We will look for triangles formed by the edges of the nodes:
- For node 2: (0, 2, 6), (2, 6, 7), (2, 7, 8), and (2, 8, 3) are triangles but only (0, 2, 6) forms a 3-star. 
- For node 7: (2, 7, 8), (7, 8, 3), (7, 8, 9) are triangles but none of them form a 3-star.
- For node 8: (2, 7, 8), (8, 3, 4), (8, 7, 9) are triangles but only (2, 7, 8) forms a 3-star.
- For node 9: (1, 9, 7), (7, 9, 8) are triangles but only (1, 9, 7) forms a 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (2, 6, 1)>, and <1, (9, 7, 8)>.
