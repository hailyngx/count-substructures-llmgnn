Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern where one node (center) is connected to exactly three other nodes (leaves).

Looking at the adjacency list for each node, we can identify the following 3-stars:
- <0, (2, 3, 4)>
- <0, (2, 3, 8)>
- <0, (2, 4, 8)>
- <0, (3, 4, 8)>
- <1, (3, 4, 6)>
- <1, (3, 4, 8)>
- <1, (3, 6, 7)>
- <1, (4, 6, 8)>
- <1, (6, 7, 8)>
- <2, (0, 6, 7)>
- <2, (0, 6, 8)>
- <2, (0, 7, 8)>
- <3, (0, 1, 9)>
- <3, (0, 8, 9)>
- <3, (1, 8, 9)>
- <4, (0, 1, 8)>
- <4, (0, 8, 9)>
- <4, (1, 8, 9)>
- <6, (0, 1, 8)>
- <6, (0, 8, 9)>
- <6, (1, 8, 9)>
- <7, (1, 2, 9)>
- <7, (1, 6, 9)>
- <7, (2, 6, 9)>
- <8, (0, 6, 9)>
- <8, (0, 7, 9)>
- <8, (1, 3, 4)>
- <8, (1, 3, 6)>
- <8, (1, 4, 6)>
- <8, (1, 6, 7)>
- <8, (3, 4, 9)>
- <8, (3, 6, 9)>
- <8, (4, 6, 9)>
- <9, (0, 3, 8)>
- <9, (1, 3, 8)>
- <9, (3, 7, 8)>
  
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [32].
