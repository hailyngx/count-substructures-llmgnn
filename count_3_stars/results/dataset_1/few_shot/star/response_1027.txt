Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 4

Response:
The 3-star structures in the given graph are:
<0, (3, 9)>
<1, (5, 7, 8)>
<4, (6, 7, 9)>
<5, (1, 8, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 4)>

There are a total of [5] 3-stars in the graph.
