Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 2) (8, 0) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star by finding the central node (center) and its three connected nodes. Let's go step by step:

1. Identify the triangles (cycles of length 3) in the graph:
   - There are no triangles in the given graph as there are no sets of 3 nodes that are fully connected to each other.

2. Identify the 3-stars in the graph:
   - From the given edges and adjacency list, we can see that possible 3-stars can be formed around nodes 0, 2, 4, 5, and 8. Nodes 1, 3, 6, 7, and 9 cannot form 3-stars in this graph.

3. List the unique 3-stars:
   - <0, (1, 8)>
   - <2, (3, 7)>
   - <4, (5)>
   - <5, (4, 6, 9)>
   - <8, (0)>
