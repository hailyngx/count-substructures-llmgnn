Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Based on the provided information, the central nodes in the 3-stars will be 1, 3, and 8 since they are the only nodes connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list the unique 3-stars:

<1, (2, 3, 5)>
<3, (1, 5, 8)>
<8, (3, 6, 7)>
<8, (6, 7, 9)>
<8, (3, 7, 9)>

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
