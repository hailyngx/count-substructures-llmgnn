Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, and node 7

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star configurations in the given graph:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 5, and 8.
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 5, and 8.
- Node 5 forms three 3-stars with nodes 0, 1, 3 and 4, 6, and 9.
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 4, and 8.
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, and 7.
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 7, and 0. 

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
The unique 3-stars are <0, (1, 5, 8)>, <5, (0, 1, 3)>, <5, (1, 0, 4)>, <5, (0, 1, 9)>, <7, (2, 4, 8)>, and <9, (5, 7, 0)>.
