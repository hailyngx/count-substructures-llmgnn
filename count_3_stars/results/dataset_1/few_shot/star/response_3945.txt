Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 4, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 5, and node 8

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Identify the nodes that are the center of a 3-star:
   - Node 1, Node 5, and Node 7 have degree 5, which means they are connected to exactly three other nodes.

2. For each identified center node, find the nodes that are connected to it to form a 3-star:
   - For Node 1: (1, 0, 4, 6), (1, 2, 4), (1, 3, 4)
   - For Node 5: (5, 3, 4, 7), (5, 4, 7, 9)
   - For Node 7: (7, 2, 5, 6)

3. Count the total number of unique 3-stars:
   - Total unique 3-stars: 5

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is: [5]

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<1, (0, 4, 6)>
<1, (2, 4)>
<1, (3, 4)>
<5, (3, 4, 7)>
<5, (4, 7, 9)>
