Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 5, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's identify the 3-stars by looking at each node's connection pattern:

- Node 0 connects to nodes 2, 3, 4 - <0, (2, 3, 4)>
- Node 1 connects to nodes 3, 4, 8 - <1, (3, 4, 8)>
- Node 2 connects to nodes 0, 3, 8 - <2, (0, 3, 8)>
- Node 3 connects to nodes 0, 1, 2 - <3, (0, 1, 2)>
- Node 6 connects to nodes 3, 5, 8 - <6, (3, 5, 8)>
- Node 9 connects to nodes 1, 2, 3 - <9, (1, 2, 3)>

Counting the unique 3-stars found, we have:
