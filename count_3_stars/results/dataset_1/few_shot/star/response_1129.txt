Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star-like formation. 

Looking at the adjacency list and considering the definition of a 3-star graph, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<1, (2, 4, 5)>
<3, (2, 6, 9)>
<4, (1, 6, 7)>
<5, (1, 6, none)>  (Note: Node 5 is only connected to one central node, but can still be considered a 3-star)

There are no other 3-star configurations possible in this graph. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
