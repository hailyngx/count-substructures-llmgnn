Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 6, and node 8

Response:
The center node must have exactly 3 neighbors to form a 3-star. Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
1. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 7, 8. <2, (0, 7, 8)>
2. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 6, 0. <4, (0, 6, 0)>
3. Node 6 is connected to nodes 4, 9, 4. <6, (4, 9, 4)>
4. Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 9, 2. <8, (2, 9, 2)>

So, there are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
Therefore, the final answer is [4].
