Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 6

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. From the adjacency list, we can see that Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 7. This forms a 3-star with Node 0 as the center and nodes 1, 5, and 7 as the leaves.  
    <0, (1, 5, 7)>

2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 7. This also forms a 3-star.  
    <1, (0, 3, 7)>

3. Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, and 6. This forms three different 3-stars:  
    <3, (1, 2, 4)>  
    <3, (1, 4, 6)>  
    <3, (2, 4, 6)>

4. Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 6, 7, 8, and 9. This also forms multiple 3-stars:  
    <2, (3, 6, 7)>  
    <2, (3, 7, 8)>  
    <2, (3, 8, 9)>  
    <2, (6, 7, 8)>  
    <2, (6, 8, 9)>

5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 3, 6, 7, and 8. This results in a 3-star.  
    <4, (3, 6, 7)>

6. Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, and 9. This also forms multiple 3-stars:  
    <6, (2, 3, 4)>  
    <6, (2, 4, 9)>  
    <6, (3, 4, 9)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars.
