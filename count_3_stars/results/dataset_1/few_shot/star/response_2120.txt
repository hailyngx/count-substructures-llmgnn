Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 3

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

In this graph, the 3-stars can be found as follows:

- <0, (2, 9, _)> 
- <1, (3, 7, 9)> 
- <2, (0, 6, _)> 
- <3, (1, 5, 6)> 
- <3, (1, 6, 8)> 
- <5, (3, 6, _)> 
- <6, (2, 3, 5)> 
- <9, (0, 1, 3)> 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
