Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all unique 3-stars. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Looking at the given edges and adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<1, (6, 7, 9)>
<3, (2, 4, 7)>
<3, (4, 2, 9)>
<3, (7, 5, 9)>
<7, (1, 3, 9)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
