Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 3

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars present.

We observe that a 3-star can be formed around a node if it has exactly three neighbors. 
Let's examine each node to see if they are a part of any 3-star:

- Node 0 has 7 neighbors (1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9) which makes it a potential center of 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors (0, 5, 6, 8) which makes it a potential center of one 3-star.
- Node 2 has only 1 neighbor (0) which is not enough to form a 3-star.
- Node 3 has only 1 neighbor (9) which is not enough to form a 3-star.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors (0, 7, 8) which makes it a center of one 3-star.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors (0, 1, 7) which makes it a center of one 3-star.
- Node 6 has only 1 neighbor (1) which is not enough to form a 3-star.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors (0, 4, 5) which makes it a center of one 3-star.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors (0, 1, 4) which makes it a center of one 3-star.
- Node 9 has only 2 neighbors (0, 3) which is not enough to form a 3-star.

Therefore, we have identified the following 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (1, 5, 9)>
<1, (0, 5, 8)>
<4, (0, 7, 8)>
<5, (0, 1, 7)>
<7, (0, 4, 5)>
<8, (0, 1, 4)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
