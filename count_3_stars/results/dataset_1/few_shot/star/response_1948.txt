Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 6
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 6

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph. 

Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 4 and 5: <1, (4, 5)>
Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 5 and 6: <2, (5, 6)>
Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 5 and 7: <2, (5, 7)>
Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 5 and 7: <3, (5, 7)>
Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 1 and 9: <4, (1, 9)>
Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 2, and 3: <5, (1, 2, 3)>
Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 2 and 9: <6, (2, 9)>
Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 7 and 9: <6, (7, 9)>
Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 2 and 3: <7, (2, 3)>
Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 4 and 6: <9, (4, 6)>

Count of 3-stars: [9]
Unique 3-stars: <1, (4, 5)>, <2, (5, 6)>, <2, (5, 7)>, <3, (5, 7)>, <4, (1, 9)>, <5, (1, 2, 3)>, <6, (2, 9)>, <6, (7, 9)>, <7, (2, 3)>
