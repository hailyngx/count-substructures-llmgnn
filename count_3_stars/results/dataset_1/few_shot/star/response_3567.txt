Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will first identify all possible 3-stars based on the definition provided and then count them.

Given the definition of a 3-star graph, we need to find all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars:
1. Node 0: <0, (2, 3, 5)>
2. Node 2: <2, (0, 4, 6)>
3. Node 4: <4, (2, 3, 6)>
4. Node 8: <8, (2, 3, 4)>

These are all the unique 3-stars in the given graph. There are a total of 4 unique 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
