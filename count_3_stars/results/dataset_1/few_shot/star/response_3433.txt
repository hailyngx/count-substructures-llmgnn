Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star configuration. A 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

<1, (2, 3, 4)>
<1, (2, 3, 7)>
<1, (2, 4, 8)>
<1, (2, 7, 5)>
<1, (4, 8, 5)>
<7, (5, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
