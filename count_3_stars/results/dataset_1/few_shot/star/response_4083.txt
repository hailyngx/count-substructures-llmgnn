Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 8

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node and the three leaves connected to it in each 3-star configuration. Let's go through the adjacency list of each node and identify the 3-stars.

Here are the unique 3-star configurations found in the graph:
<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<0, (1, 5, 9)>
<0, (1, 8, 9)>
<0, (5, 8, 9)>
<5, (0, 4, 8)>
<5, (0, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 5, 9)>
<9, (0, 4, 8)>

Count of 3-stars: [8]
