Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, and node 7

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes (forming a 3-star). 

The nodes in this graph are labeled from 0 to 9. Let's go through each node and identify the 3-stars:

- Node 0: 3-stars <0, (2, 4, 8)>
- Node 1: No 3-stars
- Node 2: 3-stars <2, (0, 5, 7)> and <2, (3, 5, 9)>
- Node 3: No 3-stars
- Node 4: 3-stars <4, (0, 5, 9)>
- Node 5: No 3-stars
- Node 6: No 3-stars
- Node 7: No 3-stars
- Node 8: No 3-stars
- Node 9: 3-stars <9, (2, 4, 6)> and <9, (2, 4, 7)>

Count of 3-stars: [5]
Unique 3-stars: <0, (2, 4, 8)>, <2, (0, 5, 7)>, <2, (3, 5, 9)>, <4, (0, 5, 9)>, <9, (2, 4, 6)>
