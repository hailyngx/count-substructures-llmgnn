Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 6) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 6
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 8

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are as follows:
<1, (6, 7, 9)>
<6, (1, 3, 5)>
<9, (1, 8, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
