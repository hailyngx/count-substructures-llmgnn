Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible 3-stars, where each 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's go through the list of nodes and their connections to identify the 3-stars:

- From the adjacency list:
  - Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 7, and 9. <0, (4, 7, 9)>
  - Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 6, and 8. <1, (5, 6, 8)>
  - Node 1 also participates in another 3-star with nodes 5, 8, and 9. <1, (5, 8, 9)>
  - Node 5 participates in various 3-stars:
    - <5, (1, 8, 9)>
    - <5, (2, 8, 9)>
    - <5, (3, 6, 9)>
  - Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, and 5. <9, (0, 1, 5)>

Count of 3-stars: [6]
Unique 3-stars: <0, (4, 7, 9)>, <1, (5, 6, 8)>, <1, (5, 8, 9)>, <5, (1, 8, 9)>, <5, (2, 8, 9)>, <5, (3, 6, 9)>
