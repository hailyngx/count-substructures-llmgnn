Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can follow the definition provided earlier - a 3-star graph consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Upon examining the graph and the given adjacency list for each node, we can observe the following 3-stars:
<0, (2, 5, 6)>
<1, (5, 8, 9)>
<2, (0, 4, 7)>
<3, (7, 8, 4)>
<4, (2, 7, 8)>
<5, (0, 1, 6)>
<6, (0, 5, 7)>
<7, (3, 4, 9)>
<8, (1, 4, 9)>
<9, (1, 7, 8)>

Counting the unique 3-stars found, we get a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
