Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will serve as the central nodes of the 3-stars. Let's identify the 3-stars:

1. Node 0: (0, 1, 4), (0, 4, 9)  <0, (1, 4, 9)>
2. Node 1: (1, 0, 4), (1, 4, 7)  <1, (0, 4, 7)>
3. Node 2: (2, 3, 4)  <2, (3, 4, 7)>
4. Node 3: (3, 2, 5), (3, 5, 7), (3, 7, 8)  <3, (2, 5, 7), (7, 3, 8)>
5. Node 4: (4, 0, 1), (4, 2, 7), (4, 7, 8)  <4, (0, 1, 5), (2, 3, 7), (7, 3, 8)>
6. Node 5: (5, 2, 3), (5, 6, 7)  <5, (2, 3, 6)>
7. Node 6: (6, 5, 7)  <6, (5, 7)>
8. Node 7: (7, 1, 4), (7, 2, 3), (7, 4, 6), (7, 6, 5)  <7, (1, 4, 6), (2, 3, 5)>
9. Node 8: (8, 3, 4)  <8, (3, 4)>
10. Node 9: (9, 0, 4)  <9, (0, 4)>

Counting the total number of unique 3-stars, we get: [9].
