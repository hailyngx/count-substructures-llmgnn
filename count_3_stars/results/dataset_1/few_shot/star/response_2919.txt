Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 4, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the 3-star patterns present in the graph. 

From the given adjacency list, we can identify the 3-star patterns as follows:
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<1, (3, 4, -)>
<2, (3, 8, 9)>
<3, (0, 1, 2), (4, 6, -)>
<4, (0, 1, 3), (8, -, -)>
<5, (0, 7, -)>
<6, (3, 8, -)>
<7, (5, 8, -)>
<8, (2, 4, 6), (7, -, -)>
<9, (2, -, -)>

By listing the unique 3-star patterns, we have:
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<1, (3, 4, -)>
<2, (3, 8, 9)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<3, (4, 6, -)>
<4, (0, 1, 3)>
<4, (8, -, -)>
<5, (0, 7, -)>
<6, (3, 8, -)>
<7, (5, 8, -)>
<8, (2, 4, 6)>
<9, (2, -, -)>

Counting the unique 3-stars gives us a total of [12].
