Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 5

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star structures in the given graph.

The 3-stars in the graph are as follows:
<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<1, (2, 9, 0)>
<2, (0, 1, 4)>
<4, (0, 2, 6)>

Thus, there are a total of [4] 3-star structures in the given graph.
