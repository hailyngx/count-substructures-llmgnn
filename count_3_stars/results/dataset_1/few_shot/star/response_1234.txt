Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 7

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

We will identify each possible 3-star, which consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes. 
1. Node 0 can form a 3-star with nodes 6, 8, and 6: <0, (6, 8, 6)>
2. Node 2 can form 3-stars with the following leaf nodes: 
    - Node 2: <2, (4, 9, 4)>
    - Node 4: <2, (4, 9, 4)>
    - Node 9: <2, (4, 9, 7)>
3. Node 3 can form a 3-star with nodes 6, 9, and 6: <3, (6, 9, 6)>
4. Node 4 can form 3-stars with the following leaf nodes: 
    - Node 2: <4, (1, 2, 6)>
    - Node 6: <4, (1, 2, 9)>
    - Node 9: <4, (1, 2, 6)>
5. Node 7 can form a 3-star with nodes 8, 9, and 8: <7, (8, 9, 8)>
6. Node 9 can form a 3-star with nodes 2, 4, and 9: <9, (2, 4, 7)>, and a 3-star with nodes 3, 4, and 6: <9, (3, 4, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
