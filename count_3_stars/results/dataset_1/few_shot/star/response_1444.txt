Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern. 

Looking at the adjacency list provided, we can analyze each node:

1. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 3, and 6: <1, (2, 3, 6)>
2. Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 7, and 9: <4, (6, 7, 9)>
3. Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 4, and 9: <6, (1, 4, 9)>
4. Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 6, and 8: <9, (4, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
