Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 7

Response:
We will identify the 3-stars in the given graph step by step.

Step 1: Identify the nodes that have exactly three neighbors.
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 2 has 0 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors.

Step 2: List the possible 3-stars in the graph.
- From Node 5: <5, (3, 7, 9)>
- From Node 9: <9, (0, 3, 7)>, <9, (3, 5, 7)>
- Total number of 3-stars: [4] 

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
