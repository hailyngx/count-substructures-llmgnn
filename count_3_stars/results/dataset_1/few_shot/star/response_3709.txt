Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 4

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (3, 6, 7)>
<0, (3, 6, 8)>
<0, (3, 7, 8)>
<0, (6, 7, 8)>
<1, (2, 8, 5)>
<2, (1, 8, 5)>
<3, (0, 5, 7)>
<4, (7, 9, 5)>
<5, (2, 3, 8)>
<5, (2, 4, 7)>
<5, (3, 4, 7)>
<5, (4, 7, 8)>
<7, (0, 4, 5)>
<8, (0, 1, 5)>

Total number of 3-stars in the given graph: [14]
