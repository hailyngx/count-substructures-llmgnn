Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 3

Response:
There are a total of [ ] 3-star in this graph. 

Let's count the 3-stars step-by-step:

1. Node 0: (0, 3, 5), (0, 5, 8) [<0, (3, 5, 8)>]

2. Node 1: (1, 2, 7) [<1, (2, 7, 4)>]

3. Node 4: (4, 5, 7), (4, 7, 8) [<4, (5, 7, 8)>]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [3].
