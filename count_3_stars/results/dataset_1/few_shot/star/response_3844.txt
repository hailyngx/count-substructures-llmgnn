Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to understand that a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

From the given adjacency list and edges, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph as follows:

1. <0, (2, 8, 9)>
2. <0, (3, 8, 9)>
3. <2, (0, 1, 9)>
4. <2, (0, 4, 9)>
5. <3, (0, 5, 7)>
6. <4, (2, 6, 7)>
7. <7, (3, 4, 9)>
8. <7, (0, 8, 9)>

Therefore, there are a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
