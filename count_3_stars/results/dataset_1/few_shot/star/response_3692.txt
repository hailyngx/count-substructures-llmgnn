Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. By definition, a 3-star structure consists of a central node connected to three other nodes by edges. 

Starting with the adjacency list provided, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<0, (2, 5, 7)>
<0, (2, 5, 9)>
<0, (4, 5, 7)>
<0, (4, 5, 9)>
<0, (5, 7, 9)>
<1, (2, 5, 8)>
<2, (0, 1, 5)>
<2, (0, 5, 8)>
<2, (1, 5, 8)>
<5, (0, 1, 2)>
<5, (0, 2, 7)>
<5, (0, 3, 7)>
<5, (1, 2, 7)>
<5, (2, 3, 7)>
<7, (0, 5, 8)>
<8, (1, 2, 7)>
<9, (0, 2, 3)>
<9, (0, 2, 6)>
<9, (0, 3, 6)>
<9, (2, 3, 6)>

By listing all the unique 3-stars found, we can count a total of [22] 3-stars in the given graph.
