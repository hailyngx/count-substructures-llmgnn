Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible configurations where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we can identify the 3-stars as follows:
1. <0, (3, 4, 8)>
2. <1, (3, 8, 4)>
3. <4, (0, 8, 2)>
4. <4, (0, 8, 7)>
5. <4, (2, 8, 7)>
6. <4, (7, 8, 0)>
7. <4, (8, 1, 7)>
8. <4, (8, 2, 7)>
9. <8, (1, 4, 6)>
10. <8, (4, 6, 7)>

Therefore, there are a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
