Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 4

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star present. 

After examining the graph and its adjacency list, we can determine the 3-stars as follows:

<0, (5, 7, 1)>
<1, (5, 3, 9)>
<2, (5, 6, 9)>
<3, (5, 1, 9)>
<5, (0, 1, 2)>
<5, (1, 2, 3)>
<5, (2, 3, 6)>
<5, (3, 6, 7)>
<6, (2, 5, 7)>
<7, (0, 5, 6)>
<9, (1, 2, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [11]. 

The unique 3-stars counted are: <0, (5, 7, 1)>, <1, (5, 3, 9)>, <2, (5, 6, 9)>, <3, (5, 1, 9)>, <5, (0, 1, 2)>, <5, (1, 2, 3)>, <5, (2, 3, 6)>, <5, (3, 6, 7)>, <6, (2, 5, 7)>, <7, (0, 5, 6)>, <9, (1, 2, 3)>.
