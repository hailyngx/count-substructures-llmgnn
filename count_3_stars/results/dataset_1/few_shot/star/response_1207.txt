Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Nodes 0 and 1 are not connected to exactly three other nodes, so they are not part of any 3-star.

For the remaining nodes:

Node 2: <2, (5, 8, 9)>
Node 3: <3, (1, 4, 6)>
Node 4: <4, (3, 5, 7)>
Node 5: <5, (2, 4, 8)>
Node 6: <6, (0, 3, 9)>
Node 7: <7, (2, 4, 9)>
Node 8: <8, (2, 5, 9)>
Node 9: <9, (2, 3, 6)> <9, (2, 6, 8)>

Count of 3-stars: [8]
