Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 5) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 6) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 5
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible 3-stars. 

Given the description, we can see that node 0 has edges connecting to nodes 5 and 9, node 1 is connected to node 4, node 2 is connected to node 5, and so on. 

Let's list down the 3-stars in this graph:
<0, (5, 9)> 
<0, (5, 2)> 

Count of 3-stars: [2]
