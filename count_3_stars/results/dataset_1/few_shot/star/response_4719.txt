Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 7, and node 8

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-star graphs in this given graph.

We will look at each node in the graph and check if it is the center of a 3-star graph. To form a 3-star graph, a node must be connected to exactly three other nodes.

Now, let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph:

1. Node 0: (0, 3, 5, 6)
2. Node 1: (1, 6, 8, 9)
3. Node 8: (8, 1, 2, 6)

Therefore, the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [3].

Unique 3-stars: 
<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<1, (6, 8, 9)>
<8, (1, 2, 6)>
