Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 8

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- Node 0 forms 1 3-star: <0, (4, 6, 9)>
- Node 1 forms 3 3-stars: <1, (2, 5, 8)>, <1, (4, 5, 6)>, <1, (7, 6, 8)>
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star: <2, (1, 8, 4)>
- Node 4 forms 2 3-stars: <4, (1, 5, 6)>, <4, (8, 0, 6)>
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star: <6, (0, 1, 7)>
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star: <8, (1, 2, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (4, 6, 9)>, <1, (2, 5, 8)>, <1, (4, 5, 6)>, <1, (7, 6, 8)>, <2, (1, 8, 4)>, <4, (1, 5, 6)>, <4, (8, 0, 6)>, <6, (0, 1, 7)>, <8, (1, 2, 9)>.
