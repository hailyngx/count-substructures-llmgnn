Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 7

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph. 

The 3-star graphs can be formed with node 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, and 7 since they have connections to exactly three other nodes. Let's count the number of 3-stars. 

[6]

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 4, 7)>
<1, (0, 4, 7)>
<3, (6, 7, 4)>
<4, (0, 2, 7)>
<6, (3, 7, 8)>
<7, (1, 3, 4)>
