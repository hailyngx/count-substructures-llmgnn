Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for all possible 3-stars formed by the nodes and their connections. Here's the step-by-step process of finding the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Identify all possible 3-stars in the graph:
   - Start with each node as the potential center node and check if it has exactly three neighboring nodes.

2. Determine the unique 3-stars:
   - Check if the node satisfies the criteria for being a center node of a 3-star and list its neighboring nodes accordingly.

3. Count the total number of unique 3-stars found.

Let's go through the process:

- Potential 3-star centered at Node 0: (0, 1, 7)
- Potential 3-star centered at Node 1: (1, 0, 3), (1, 4, 9)
- Potential 3-star centered at Node 2: (2, 3, 7), (2, 7, 9)
- Potential 3-star centered at Node 3: (3, 1, 2), (3, 6, 7)
- Potential 3-star centered at Node 4: (4, 1, 5)
- Potential 3-star centered at Node 5: (5, 4, 7), (5, 8, 9)
- Potential 3-star centered at Node 6: Not a 3-star since it has only one neighbor.
- Potential 3-star centered at Node 7: (7, 0, 2), (7, 3, 5)
- Potential 3-star centered at Node 8: Not a 3-star since it has only two neighbors.
- Potential 3-star centered at Node 9: (9, 1, 2), (9, 8, 4)

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 7)>
<1, (0, 3)>, <1, (4, 9)>
<2, (3, 7)>, <2, (7, 9)>
<3, (1, 2)>, <3, (6, 7)>
<4, (1, 5)>
<5, (4, 7)>, <5, (8, 9)>
<7, (0, 2)>, <7, (3, 5)>
<9, (1, 2)>, <9, (8, 4)>
