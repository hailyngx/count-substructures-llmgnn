Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 8

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be found by counting the number of pairs of nodes that share a common neighbor. Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph step by step:

1. For each node, find the neighbors of the node. The neighbors are the nodes directly connected to the current node.

Node 0: {7, 8}
Node 1: {2, 4, 7}
Node 2: {1, 3, 9}
Node 3: {2, 5, 7}
Node 4: {1, 8}
Node 5: {3, 6}
Node 6: {5, 7, 8}
Node 7: {0, 1, 3, 6, 9}
Node 8: {0, 4, 6, 9}
Node 9: {2, 7, 8}

2. Identify the 3-stars by checking for common neighbors between pairs of nodes:

- For Node 0:
    <0, (7, 8)> (Center: 0, Leaves: 7, 8)

- For Node 1:
    No 3-stars for Node 1

- For Node 2:
    No 3-stars for Node 2

- For Node 3:
    No 3-stars for Node 3

- For Node 4:
    No 3-stars for Node 4

- For Node 5:
    No 3-stars for Node 5

- For Node 6:
    <6, (7, 8, 9)> (Center: 6, Leaves: 7, 8, 9)

- For Node 7:
    No 3-stars for Node 7

- For Node 8:
    No 3-stars for Node 8

- For Node 9:
    No 3-stars for Node 9

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [(2)]. The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (7, 8)>
<6, (7, 8, 9)>
