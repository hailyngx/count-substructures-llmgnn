Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 6) (4, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

The possible 3-stars in this graph are as follows:
<0, (9, 5, 6)>
<1, (4, 6, 2)>
<1, (6, 2, 5)>
<2, (5, 9, 1)>
<2, (6, 1, 5)>
<3, (6, 1, 9)>
<4, (1, 6, 2)>
<5, (2, 9, 6)>
<5, (9, 6, 2)>
<6, (1, 2, 7)>
<6, (1, 3, 9)>
<6, (2, 1, 5)>
<6, (2, 5, 1)>
<6, (3, 1, 9)>
<6, (7, 1, 2)>
<9, (0, 5, 6)>
<9, (5, 0, 6)>
<9, (6, 0, 5)>
<9, (6, 5, 0)>
<9, (8, 5, 6)>
<9, (8, 6, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [21].
