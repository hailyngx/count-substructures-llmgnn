Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star-like configuration.

In this graph, the possible 3-star configurations are:
1. <1, (2, 4, 6)>
2. <2, (1, 3, 7)>
3. <3, (0, 2, 7)>
4. <4, (1, 6, 8)>
5. <7, (1, 2, 3)>
6. <8, (3, 4, 9)>

Counting all these unique 3-stars, we get a total of [6].
