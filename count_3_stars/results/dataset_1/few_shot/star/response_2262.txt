Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 44 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 5, and node 6

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph can be identified by finding nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list the 3-stars found in the graph:

<2, (1, 5, 6)>
<3, (0, 1, 4)>
<4, (0, 3, 6)>
<6, (2, 4, 7)>
<7, (2, 3, 6)>
<8, (1, 4, 5)>
<9, (2, 4, 5)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we get a total of [7].
