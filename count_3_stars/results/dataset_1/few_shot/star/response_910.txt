Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, and node 7

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are as follows: 

<0, (4, 5, 1)>
<1, (3, 4, 0)>
<2, (9, 3, 6)>
<3, (1, 6, 9)>
<4, (0, 1, 5)>
<5, (0, 4, 1)>
<6, (3, 7, 9)>
<7, (6, 9, 3)>
<9, (2, 6, 7)>

Therefore, there are a total of [9] 3-star graphs in the given graph.
