Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node and its three connected nodes in each 3-star structure. 

Let's start by listing all the 3-star structures in the graph:

<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<3, (0, 2, 6)>
<3, (1, 2, 9)>
<8, (1, 2, 4)>
<8, (1, 2, 5)>
<8, (1, 2, 7)>
<8, (1, 4, 5)>
<8, (1, 5, 7)>
<8, (2, 4, 9)>
<8, (2, 5, 9)>
<8, (4, 5, 7)>
<3, (9, 2, 6)>

Counting the unique 3-star structures, we get a total of [12].
