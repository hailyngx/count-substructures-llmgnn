Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 7

Response:
Let's first identify the possible 3-stars in this graph. Since a 3-star has a center node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can look for nodes with 3 outgoing edges. 

From the given information, the possible 3-stars can have center nodes 0, 3, 4, 6, 7.

Next, let's find the neighbors of each of these potential center nodes:
- Center node 0: (2, 3, 4, 6)
- Center node 3: (0, 2, 6)
- Center node 4: (0, 5)
- Center node 6: (0, 3)
- Center node 7: (1, 8, 9)

Now, by examining the connections of the potential center nodes with their neighbors, we can count the number of 3-stars in the graph.

[Total number of 3-stars: [2]]

<0, (2, 3, 6)>
<7, (1, 8, 9)>
