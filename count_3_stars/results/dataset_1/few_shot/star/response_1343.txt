Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 7

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
1. Node 0: (2, 4, 6), (4, 7, 8)
2. Node 1: (3, 5, 4)
3. Node 5: (1, 2, 6), (2, 4, 8), (4, 6, 7), (6, 7, 8)

Therefore, there are a total of [5] unique 3-stars in the graph. 
The unique 3-stars are <0, (2, 4, 6)>, <0, (4, 7, 8)>, <1, (3, 5, 4)>, <5, (1, 2, 6)>, <5, (2, 4, 8)>.
