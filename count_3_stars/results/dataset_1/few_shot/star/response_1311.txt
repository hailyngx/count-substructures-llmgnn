Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 6

Response:
Given the graph information, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 9. This creates one 3-star: <0, (2, 3, 9)>.
2. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, 7, 8, and 9. This creates five 3-stars: <2, (0, 3, 4)>, <2, (0, 7, 8)>, <2, (0, 7, 9)>, <2, (3, 4, 7)>, and <2, (3, 7, 8)>.
3. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 4. This creates one 3-star: <3, (0, 2, 4)>.
4. Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 7, and 9. This creates one 3-star: <6, (1, 7, 9)>.
5. Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 6, and 8. This creates one 3-star: <7, (2, 6, 8)>.
6. Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 6. This creates one 3-star: <9, (0, 2, 6)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (2, 3, 9)>, <2, (0, 3, 4)>, <2, (0, 7, 8)>, <2, (0, 7, 9)>, <2, (3, 4, 7)>, <2, (3, 7, 8)>, <3, (0, 2, 4)>, <6, (1, 7, 9)>, and <7, (2, 6, 8)>.
