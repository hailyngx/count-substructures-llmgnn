Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 5

Response:
The 3-star graph can be visualized as:

```
       1
       |
   2 - 0 - 8
       |
       5
    /  |  \
   4   9   8
    \  |  /
       7
```

The unique 3-stars in this graph are:
<0, (5, 4, 8)>
<2, (7, 4, 5)>
<5, (0, 4, 8)>
<5, (4, 7, 9)>
<5, (8, 0, 9)>
<8, (1, 5, 4)>
<9, (3, 5, 4)>

Total number of 3-stars: [7]
