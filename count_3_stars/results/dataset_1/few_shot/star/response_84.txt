Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 6

Response:
The central nodes (centers) can be any node in the graph. We can start by checking each node to see if it forms a 3-star with its neighboring nodes.

Let's go through each node and identify the 3-stars:

- Node 0: <0, (5, 6, 7)>
- Node 1: <1, (3, 4, 8)>
- Node 2: <2, (7, 9, 3)>
- Node 3: <3, (1, 6, 9)>
- Node 4: No 3-star
- Node 5: No 3-star
- Node 6: <6, (0, 3, 5)>
- Node 7: <7, (0, 2, 8)>
- Node 8: No 3-star
- Node 9: <9, (2, 3, 6)>

Therefore, there are **5** unique 3-stars in the given graph.
