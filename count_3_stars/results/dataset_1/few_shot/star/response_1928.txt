Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (6, 0) (7, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars. Let's go step by step:

1. Identify all nodes with 3 connections (degree 3), as these nodes can be the centers of 3-stars.

- Node 1, Node 4, and Node 8 have a degree of 3.

2. For each of these nodes, find all the unique 3-stars they are part of.

- For Node 1: 
    - (1, 4, 5)
    - (1, 4, 8)
    
- For Node 4: 
    - (4, 1, 5)
    - (4, 1, 8)

- For Node 8: 
    - (8, 4, 1)

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are <1, (4, 5, 8)>, <4, (1, 5, 8)>. 

Finally, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
