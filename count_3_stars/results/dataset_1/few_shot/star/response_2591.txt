Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (2, 6, 8)>
<3, (6, 8, 9)>
<7, (5, 6, 9)>
<1, (6, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 3, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
