Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars. 

Let's first find all the 3-stars in the graph:
1. <0, (2, 4, 9)>
2. <2, (0, 4, 9)>
3. <4, (0, 2, 5)>
4. <5, (1, 4, 9)>
5. <9, (0, 2, 5)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph.
