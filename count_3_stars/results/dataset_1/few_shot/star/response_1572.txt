Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 6

Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the unique 3-stars in the graph. Since a 3-star involves a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we need to look for nodes that have exactly three neighbors.

Let's identify the 3-stars:

Nodes with 3 neighbors are:
- Node 1 (neighbors: 3, 5, 6)
- Node 2 (neighbors: 0, 3, 5)
- Node 3 (neighbors: 1, 2, 5)
- Node 5 (neighbors: 1, 2, 3)
- Node 6 (neighbors: 0, 1, 4)
- Node 7 (neighbors: 1, 2, 5)

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<1, (3, 5, 6)>
<2, (0, 3, 5)>
<3, (1, 2, 5)>
<5, (1, 2, 3)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
