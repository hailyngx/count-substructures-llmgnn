Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 6
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a 3-star pattern. Let's identify them step by step:

1. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 5, and 6. <1, (4, 5, 6)>
2. Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 5, and 7. <3, (4, 5, 7)>
3. Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 6, and 7. <5, (1, 6, 7)>
4. Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 5, and 8. <6, (1, 5, 8)>
5. Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 5, and 9. <7, (3, 5, 9)>

Therefore, there are [5] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
