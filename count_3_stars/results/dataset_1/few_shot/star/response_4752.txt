Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 6

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star patterns in the given graph. 

First, let's list the 3-star patterns for each node:
- Node 0: <0, (2, 3, 4)>, <0, (2, 7, 8)>, <0, (2, 7, 5)>, <0, (2, 4, 9)>, <0, (3, 5, 8)>, <0, (3, 5, 7)>, <0, (3, 8, 5)>, <0, (3, 8, 0)>, <0, (4, 9, 6)>, <0, (7, 4, 9)>, <0, (7, 5, 8)>, <0, (7, 5, 3)>, <0, (8, 5, 3)>, <0, (8, 5, 7)>, <0, (9, 4, 7)>
- Node 1: No 3-stars as it's not connected to any other nodes.
- Node 2: No 3-stars as it's only connected to node 0.
- Node 3: <3, (0, 5, 8)>, <3, (0, 5, 7)>, <3, (0, 8, 5)>, <3, (0, 8, 3)>
- Node 4: <4, (0, 7, 5)>, <4, (0, 7, 3)>, <4, (0, 9, 6)>
- Node 5: <5, (3, 7, 0)>, <5, (3, 7, 4)>, <5, (3, 8, 0)>
- Node 6: No 3-stars as it's only connected to node 9.
- Node 7: <7, (0, 4, 9)>, <7, (0, 5, 8)>, <7, (0, 5, 3)>
- Node 8: <8, (0, 3, 5)>, <8, (0, 5, 7)>, <8, (0, 5, 3)>
- Node 9: <9, (0, 4, 7)>, <9, (0, 4, 5)>, <9, (0, 4, 5)>

Therefore, there are a total of [24] 3-star patterns in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 3, 4)>, <0, (2, 7, 8)>, <0, (2, 7, 5)>, <0, (2, 4, 9)>, <0, (3, 5, 8)>, <0, (3, 5, 7)>, <0, (3, 8, 5)>, <0, (3, 8, 0)>, <0, (4, 9, 6)>, <0, (7, 4, 9)>, <0, (7, 5, 8)>, <0, (7, 5, 3)>, <0, (8, 5, 3)>, <0, (8, 5, 7)>, <0, (9, 4, 7)>, <3, (0, 5, 8)>, <3, (0, 5, 7)>, <3, (0, 8, 5)>, <3, (0, 8, 3)>, <4, (0, 7, 5)>, <4, (0, 7, 3)>, <4, (0, 9, 6)>, <5, (3, 7, 0)>, <5, (3, 7, 4)>, <5, (3, 8, 0)>, <7, (0, 4, 9)>, <7, (0, 5, 8)>, <7, (0, 5, 3)>, <8, (0, 3, 5)>, <8, (0, 5, 7)>, <8, (0, 5, 3)>, <9, (0, 4, 7)>, <9, (0, 4, 5)>
