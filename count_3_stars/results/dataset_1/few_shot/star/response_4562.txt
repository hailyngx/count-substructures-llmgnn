Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify all the unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through each node and identify the 3-stars:

1. For Node 0:
   - <0, (1, 7)>
   (Node 0 is the center connected to nodes 1 and 7)

2. For Node 1:
   No 3-star as it is only connected to one other node.

3. For Node 2:
   - <2, (4, 8, 9)>
   (Node 2 is the center connected to nodes 4, 8, and 9)

4. For Node 3:
   No 3-star as it is not connected to any other node.

5. For Node 4:
   - <4, (2, 6)>
   (Node 4 is the center connected to nodes 2 and 6)

6. For Node 5:
   No 3-star as it is only connected to one other node.

7. For Node 6:
   - <6, (4, 7)>
   (Node 6 is the center connected to nodes 4 and 7)

8. For Node 7:
   - <7, (0, 6, 9)>
   (Node 7 is the center connected to nodes 0, 6, and 9)

9. For Node 8:
   No 3-star as it is only connected to one other node.

10. For Node 9:
   - <9, (2, 5, 7)>
   (Node 9 is the center connected to nodes 2, 5, and 7)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5]. 
The unique 3-stars are <0, (1, 7)>, <2, (4, 8, 9)>, <4, (2, 6)>, <6, (4, 7)>, and <7, (0, 6, 9)>.
