Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph, we can look for each node that has exactly three edges connected to it, forming a 3-star. 

Inspecting the adjacency list given for each node, we find that the nodes forming 3-stars are:
- <0, (4, 5, 6)>
- <2, (6, 8, 9)>
- <5, (0, 4, 6)>
- <9, (2, 4, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [4]. 

<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<2, (6, 8, 9)>
<5, (0, 4, 6)>
<9, (2, 4, 5)>
