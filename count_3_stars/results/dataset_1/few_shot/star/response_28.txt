Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 8
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars present. 

Looking at the adjacency lists, we can see that the nodes connected to exactly three other nodes are:
- Node 0: 5, 8, and 9
- Node 1: 5, 7, and 9
- Node 5: 0, 1, 7, and 9
- Node 8: 0, 3, 6, and 7
- Node 9: 0, 1, 2, and 5

Now, let's list down the unique 3-stars present in the graph:
<0, (5, 8, 9)>
<1, (5, 7, 9)>
<5, (0, 1, 7)>
<8, (0, 3, 6)>
<9, (0, 1, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
