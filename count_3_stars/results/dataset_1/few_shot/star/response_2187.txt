Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we see that only Node 9 satisfies this condition. Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 6. This forms a 3-star pattern with Node 9 as the center and nodes 2, 3, and 6 as the leaves.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1] and the unique 3-star found is: <9, (2, 3, 6)>.
