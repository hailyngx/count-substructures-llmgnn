Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node's neighbors and identify any possible 3-stars. 

Let's analyze each node:
- Node 0 forms one 3-star: <0, (8, 9)>
- Node 1 does not form any 3-star because it only has one connection.
- Node 2 forms one 3-star: <2, (3, 5)>
- Node 3 does not form any 3-stars because it has two connections to the same node.
- Node 4 does not form any 3-star because it only has one connection.
- Node 5 does not form any 3-star because it only has one connection.
- Node 6 forms one 3-star: <6, (1, 9)>
- Node 7 forms one 3-star: <7, (8, 9)>
- Node 8 forms two 3-stars: <8, (0, 4, 7)> and <8, (0, 7, 4)>
- Node 9 forms two 3-stars: <9, (0, 3, 6)> and <9, (0, 6, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6]. 
The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
<0, (8, 9)>, 
<2, (3, 5)>, 
<6, (1, 9)>, 
<7, (8, 9)>, 
<8, (0, 4, 7)>, 
<9, (0, 3, 6)>.
