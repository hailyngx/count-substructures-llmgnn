Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify all occurrences of the central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Below are the 3-stars found in the graph:

<1, (0, 7, 8)>
<3, (0, 4, 9)>
<4, (1, 3, 5)>
<7, (1, 5, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
