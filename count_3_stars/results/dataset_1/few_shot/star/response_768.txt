Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 5

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0: <0, (1, 2, 3)>
2. Node 2: <2, (0, 3, 6)>
3. Node 5: <5, (2, 4, 7)>
4. Node 6: <6, (0, 4, 8)>

There are a total of [4] 3-stars in the graph.
