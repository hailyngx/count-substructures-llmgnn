Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 1 forms a 3-star <1, (4, 7, 8)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star <2, (3, 5, 7)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star <5, (2, 4, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
