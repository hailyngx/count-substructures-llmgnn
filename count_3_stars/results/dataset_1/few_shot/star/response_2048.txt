Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 5
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible configurations where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Since a 3-star consists of a central node connected to three leaves, we can look for nodes with exactly three edges.

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (4, 6, 8)>
<3, (1, 4, 9)>
<4, (0, 3, 8)>
<5, (4, 6, 8)>
<6, (0, 1, 5)>
<8, (0, 4, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
