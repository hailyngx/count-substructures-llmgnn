Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 8
