Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes forming a star pattern.

Given the adjacency list, we can identify the 3-stars as follows:
1. Node 2: <2, (1, 3, 5)>
2. Node 3: <3, (2, 6, 8)>
3. Node 7: <7, (0, 4, 6)>
4. Node 9: <9, (0, 1, 3)>, <9, (0, 5, 7)>, <9, (1, 3, 8)>, <9, (3, 7, 8)>

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].  
The unique 3-stars found are <2, (1, 3, 5)>, <3, (2, 6, 8)>, <7, (0, 4, 6)>, <9, (0, 1, 3)>, <9, (0, 5, 7)>, <9, (1, 3, 8)>, <9, (3, 7, 8)>.
