Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, 6, and node 8

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node has exactly three neighbors and check if these neighbors form a 3-star with the node as the center.

Let's start by listing the nodes that form 3-stars based on the given information:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 4, and 7
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 3, and 9
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, and 5
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 8, and 9
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 9, and 6
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 6, and 8
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 4, and 7
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 4, and 8

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we have:
<0, (2, 4, 7)>, 
<1, (2, 3, 9)>, 
<2, (0, 1, 5)>, 
<4, (0, 8, 9)>, 
<5, (2, 9, 6)>, 
<7, (0, 6, 8)>, 
<8, (0, 4, 7)>, 
<9, (1, 4, 8)> 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
