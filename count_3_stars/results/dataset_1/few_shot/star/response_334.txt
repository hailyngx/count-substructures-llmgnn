Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 7

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph by finding all instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

The 3-stars in the graph are as follows: 
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<1, (0, 4, 6)>
<4, (0, 1, 2)>
<4, (0, 1, 3)>
<4, (0, 6, 8)>
<4, (1, 6, 8)>
<4, (3, 6, 8)>
<4, (8, 9, 7)>
<6, (0, 1, 3)>
<8, (4, 5, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
