Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming the shape of a 3-star.

In this graph, we can observe the following 3-stars:
<0, (5, 6, 7)>
<2, (4, 8, 9)>
<4, (2, 5, 6)>
<5, (0, 4, 6)>
<6, (0, 3, 4)>
<8, (2, 4, 9)>
<9, (3, 4, 8)>

Count of 3-stars = 7
