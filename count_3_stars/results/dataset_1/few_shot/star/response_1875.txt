Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. We will list these instances below:

<1, (3, 6, 7)>
<1, (3, 7, 8)>
<1, (6, 7, 8)>
<2, (3, 5, 8)>
<3, (1, 2, 5)>
<3, (1, 5, 7)>
<3, (1, 5, 8)>
<3, (2, 5, 8)>
<5, (2, 3, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is: [9].
