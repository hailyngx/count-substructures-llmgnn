Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star pattern where one node (the center) is connected to exactly three other nodes (the leaves).

In this graph, the 3-star patterns are as follows:
<0, (4, 5, 9)>
<1, (6, 7, 9)>
<2, (7, 9, 0)>
<3, (4, 6, 8)>
<4, (0, 3, 9)>
<5, (0, 7, 9)>
<6, (1, 3, 7)>
<7, (1, 2, 5)>
<8, (3)>
<9, (0, 2, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
