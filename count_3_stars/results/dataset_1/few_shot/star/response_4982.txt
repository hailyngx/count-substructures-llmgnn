Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 6, 7, and node 8

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star configurations in the given graph. 
Since a 3-star graph consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can look for nodes that have exactly three neighbors. 

From the adjacency list:
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 4, 5, 6
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors: 3, 5
- Node 7 has 1 neighbor: 9
- Node 8 has 1 neighbor: 9

Therefore, we have identified two potential 3-stars: <3, (4, 5, 6)> and <6, (3, 5, 9)>.

However, we need to check if these potential 3-stars meet the definition by looking at the edges in the graph:
- For <3, (4, 5, 6)>: (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6) are present in the edges.
- For <6, (3, 5, 9)>: (6, 3), (6, 5), (6, 9) are present in the edges.

Both potential 3-stars indeed exist in the graph. Hence, the total number of 3-stars is [2].

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found are <3, (4, 5, 6)> and <6, (3, 5, 9)>.
