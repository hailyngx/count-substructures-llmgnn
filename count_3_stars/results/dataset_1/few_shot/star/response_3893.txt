Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step by step:

1. Identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
   - Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 9.
   - Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, and 8.
   - Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 5.

2. Count the number of unique 3-stars by considering each of these nodes as the center of a 3-star:
   - For Node 1:
     - <1, (2, 3, 4)> (Found one 3-star)
     - <1, (2, 3, 6)> (Found one 3-star)
     - <1, (2, 3, 8)>
     - <1, (2, 4, 6)> (Found one 3-star)
     - <1, (2, 4, 8)>
     - <1, (2, 6, 8)>
     - <1, (3, 4, 6)> (Found one 3-star)
     - <1, (3, 4, 8)>
     - <1, (3, 6, 8)>
     - <1, (4, 6, 8)>
     (Total: 3 3-stars)

   - For Node 3:
     - <3, (0, 1, 2)>
     - <3, (0, 1, 8)>
     - <3, (0, 2, 8)>
     - <3, (1, 2, 8)>
     (Total: 4 3-stars)

   - For Node 8:
     - <8, (1, 3, 5)>
     (Total: 1 3-star)

3. Calculate the total number of 3-stars in the graph:
   - Total = 3 (from Node 1) + 4 (from Node 3) + 1 (from Node 8) = 8

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].

(Note: The number of 3-stars listed above includes unique combinations only.)
