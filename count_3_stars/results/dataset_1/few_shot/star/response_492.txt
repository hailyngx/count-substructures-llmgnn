Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 6, and node 7

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Upon examining the given information, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (2, 7, 8)>   
<0, (2, 7, 9)>   
<0, (2, 8, 9)>   
<0, (7, 8, 9)>  
<3, (4, 6, 8)>  
<3, (4, 6, 9)>  
<3, (4, 8, 9)>  
<3, (6, 8, 9)>  
<7, (0, 1, 6)>  
<7, (0, 6, 8)>  
<7, (0, 6, 9)>  
<8, (0, 3, 6)>  
<8, (0, 6, 9)>  
<8, (3, 6, 9)>  
<9, (0, 3, 6)>  
<9, (0, 6, 7)>  
<9, (3, 6, 7)>  

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].
