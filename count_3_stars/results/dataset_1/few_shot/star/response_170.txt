Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node and its three connected nodes in each 3-star pattern.

Let's go through the nodes one by one and identify the 3-stars:

1. For Node 0:
   - Node 6 is connected to Node 0, forming a 3-star: <6, (0, 1, 2)>
   - Total 3-stars: [1]

2. For Node 1:
   - Node 6 is connected to Node 1, forming a 3-star: <6, (0, 1, 2)>
   - Total 3-stars: [1]

3. For Node 2:
   - Node 6 is connected to Node 2, forming a 3-star: <6, (0, 1, 2)>
   - Total 3-stars: [1]

4. For Node 3:
   - Node 4 is connected to Node 3, forming a potential 3-star: <4, (3, 7, 9)>
   - Total 3-stars: [1]

5. For Node 4:
   - Since Node 4 is connected to Nodes 3, 7, and 9, it can form multiple 3-stars:
     - <3, (4, 7, 9)>
   - Total 3-stars: [2]

6. For Node 5:
   - Node 6 is connected to Node 5, forming a 3-star: <6, (0, 1, 2)>
   - Total 3-stars: [2]

7. For Node 6:
   - Since Node 6 is connected to Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 5, it can form multiple 3-stars:
     - <6, (0, 1, 2)>
     - <6, (5, 8, 9)>
   - Total 3-stars: [4]

8. For Node 7:
   - Node 4 is connected to Node 7, forming a potential 3-star: <4, (3, 7, 9)>
   - Total 3-stars: [4]

9. For Node 8:
   - Node 9 is connected to Node 8, forming a potential 3-star: <9, (4, 7, 8)>
   - Total 3-stars: [4, 5]

10. For Node 9:
   - Since Node 9 is connected to Nodes 4, 7, and 8, it can form multiple 3-stars:
     - <4, (3, 7, 9)>
     - <9, (4, 7, 8)>
   - Total 3-stars: [6]

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
The unique 3-stars found are:
<6, (0, 1, 2)>
<6, (5, 8, 9)>
<3, (4, 7, 9)>
<4, (3, 7, 9)>
<9, (4, 7, 8)>
