Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 2

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Based on the provided information, we can identify the 3-stars:

<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<1, (2, 5, 7)>
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<2, (0, 6, 9)>
<2, (1, 6, 9)>
<4, (0, 7, 0)>
<5, (0, 1, 7)>
<7, (1, 2, 4)>
<7, (1, 2, 5)>
<7, (4, 5, 6)>

By counting the unique 3-stars, we find that there are [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
