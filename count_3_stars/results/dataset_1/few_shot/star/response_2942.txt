Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, and node 7

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify the 3-stars by looking at each node's connections.

- Node 0: Creates one 3-star <0, (3, 5, 7)>
- Node 1: Creates two 3-stars <1, (3, 5, 7)> and <1, (4, 5, 8)>
- Node 2: Does not create any 3-star
- Node 3: Creates one 3-star <3, (0, 1, 6)>
- Node 4: Does not create any 3-star
- Node 5: Creates one 3-star <5, (0, 1, 9)>
- Node 6: Does not create any 3-star
- Node 7: Creates one 3-star <7, (0, 1, 9)>
- Node 8: Does not create any 3-star
- Node 9: Does not create any 3-star

Count of 3-stars = 4

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
