Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each combination of a center node and its three connected nodes.

Looking at the adjacency list, we can identify the 3-stars as follows:
1. Center node: 1, Connected nodes: (2, 4, 6)
2. Center node: 2, Connected nodes: (1, 7, 9)
3. Center node: 4, Connected nodes: (1, 6, 9)
4. Center node: 7, Connected nodes: (2, 5, 6)
5. Center node: 9, Connected nodes: (1, 4, 7)

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the graph are:
<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<2, (1, 7, 9)>
<4, (1, 6, 9)>
<7, (2, 5, 6)>
<9, (1, 4, 7)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
