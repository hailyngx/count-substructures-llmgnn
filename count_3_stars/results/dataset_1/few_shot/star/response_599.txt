Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 8

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are as follows:

<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<0, (4, 5, 7)>
<0, (5, 1, 3)>
<0, (5, 4, 7)>
<0, (5, 7, 8)>
<2, (0, 4, 5)>
<2, (8, 3, 5)>
<4, (0, 5, 7)>
<7, (4, 5, 0)>
<8, (2, 3, 5)>
<8, (3, 5, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [11].
