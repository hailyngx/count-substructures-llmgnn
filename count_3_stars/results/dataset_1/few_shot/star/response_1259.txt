Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 8
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 8

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars present.

Starting from the adjacency list:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with leaves 1, 4, and 8: <0, (1, 4, 8)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with leaves 0, 3, and 5: <1, (0, 3, 5)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with leaves 1, 2, and 3: <5, (1, 2, 3)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with leaves 0, 7, and 9: <8, (0, 7, 9)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with leaves 1, 7, and 8: <9, (1, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
