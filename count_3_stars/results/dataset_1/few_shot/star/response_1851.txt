Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars. A 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes.

From the adjacency list provided, we can see the following 3-stars present in the graph:
<0, (2, 6, 7)>
<1, (2, 3, 5)>
<2, (0, 1, 4)>
<3, (1, 4, 5)>
<4, (2, 3, 5)>
<5, (1, 2, 3)>
<6, (0, 5, 8)>
<7, (0, 1, 8)>
<8, (3, 4, 6)>
<9, (1, 2, 5)>

Counting all the unique 3-stars, we get a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
