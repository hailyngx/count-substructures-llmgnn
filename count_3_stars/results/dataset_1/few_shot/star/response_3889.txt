Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the 3-stars by finding all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Looking at the given information, the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes are:
- Node 2: Connected to nodes 4, 5, and 9
- Node 5: Connected to nodes 0, 2, and 8

Let's list these 3-stars:
<2, (4, 5, 9)>
<5, (0, 2, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
