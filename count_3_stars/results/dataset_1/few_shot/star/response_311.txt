Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 5) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 5

Response:
Calculating the number of 3-stars in the given graph:
- There are 10 nodes in total.
- The number of 3-star graphs can be calculated by considering each node as the potential center of a 3-star and checking how many sets of three other nodes are connected to it.

Here are the calculations for each node being the center of a 3-star:
- Node 0: Connected to 2, 6, 8, 9 -> <0, (2, 6, 8)>, <0, (2, 6, 9)>, <0, (2, 8, 9)>, <0, (6, 8, 9)> [4]
- Node 1: Connected to 4, 5, 6 -> <1, (4, 5, 6)> [1]
- Node 2: Connected to 0, 3 -> Not a center of a 3-star
- Node 3: Connected to 2, 5, 6 -> <3, (2, 5, 6)> [1]
- Node 4: Connected to 1 -> Not a center of a 3-star
- Node 5: Connected to 1, 3, 6, 7, 9 -> <5, (1, 3, 6)>, <5, (1, 3, 9)>, <5, (1, 6, 9)>, <5, (3, 6, 9)> [4]
- Node 6: Connected to 0, 1, 3, 5 -> <6, (0, 1, 3)>, <6, (0, 1, 5)>, <6, (0, 3, 5)> [3]
- Node 7: Connected to 5 -> Not a center of a 3-star
- Node 8: Connected to 0 -> Not a center of a 3-star
- Node 9: Connected to 0, 5 -> <9, (0, 5, 6)> [1]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is: [4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 3 + 1] = [14].
