Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 9
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 6

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].

The 3-stars in the graph are:
<1, (2, 3, 6)>
<1, (2, 6, 9)>
<2, (1, 3, 6)>
