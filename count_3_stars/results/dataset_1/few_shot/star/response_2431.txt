Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Looking at the adjacency list for each node, we can identify the following unique 3-stars:
<0, (2, 5, 9)>
<1, (2, 6, 9)>
<2, (0, 1, 6)>
<4, (5, 7, 8)>
<5, (0, 4, 7)>
<6, (1, 2, 7)>
<7, (4, 5, 6)>
<9, (0, 1, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
