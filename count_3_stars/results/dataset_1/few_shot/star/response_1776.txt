Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, 6, and node 7

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes of the 3-stars in the graph. Since a 3-star has a central node that is connected to exactly three other nodes, we look for nodes in the graph that have exactly three edges connected to them.

From the adjacency list provided, the nodes with three edges connected to them are:
- Node 0
- Node 1
- Node 2
- Node 3
- Node 7

Next, let's find all the possible 3-stars in the graph by checking the neighbors of each central node to see if they form a 3-star configuration. We will consider all possible combinations without repetitions.

For Node 0:
- <0, (3, 5, 6)>
- <0, (3, 5, 9)>
- <0, (3, 6, 9)>
- <0, (5, 6, 9)>

For Node 1:
- <1, (2, 3, 4)>
- <1, (2, 3, 7)>
- <1, (2, 4, 7)>
- <1, (3, 4, 7)>

For Node 2:
- <2, (1, 5, 6)>
- <2, (1, 5, 8)>
- <2, (1, 6, 8)>
- <2, (5, 6, 8)>

For Node 3:
- <3, (0, 5, 6)>
- <3, (0, 5, 7)>
- <3, (0, 6, 7)>
- <3, (5, 6, 7)>

For Node 7:
- <7, (1, 3, 9)>
- <7, (1, 4, 9)>
- <7, (3, 4, 9)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [16]. (inside brackets)
