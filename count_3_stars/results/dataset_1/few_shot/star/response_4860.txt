Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node acts as the center of a 3-star by being connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through the nodes one by one:

- Node 0: Not a center of a 3-star
- Node 1: Not a center of a 3-star
- Node 2: Not a center of a 3-star
- Node 3: Not a center of a 3-star
- Node 4: Two potential 3-stars:
  <4, (1, 5, 9)>
- Node 5: Two potential 3-stars:
  <5, (0, 4, 7)>
- Node 6: Not a center of a 3-star
- Node 7: Not a center of a 3-star
- Node 8: Not a center of a 3-star
- Node 9: Not a center of a 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2]. The unique 3-stars found are: <4, (1, 5, 9)> and <5, (0, 4, 7)>.
