Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first understand what a 3-star is in this context. A 3-star graph consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the given graph, the nodes and their connections are as follows:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0 and 7.
- Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
- Node 3 is connected to node 5.
- Node 4 is connected to node 8.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 6.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 5 and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 8, and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 4 and 7.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 6, and 7.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph.

There is only one 3-star in this graph, which is <0, (1, 5, 9)>.

Finally, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1].
