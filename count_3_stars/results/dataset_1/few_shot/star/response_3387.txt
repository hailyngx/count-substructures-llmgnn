Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list out the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<2, (0, 5, 6)>
<2, (1, 3, 7)>
<2, (5, 6, 8)>
<2, (6, 8, 9)>
<3, (2, 4, 5)>
<3, (2, 5, 6)>
<4, (0, 2, 8)>
<5, (2, 3, 6)>
<5, (2, 6, 8)>
<6, (2, 3, 5)>
<6, (2, 5, 8)>
<8, (4, 5, 6)>
<9, (1, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [(14)].
