Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 4, 6, and node 7

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Here, a 3-star will consist of the central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list all the unique 3-stars:

[<2, (4, 5, 6)>, <2, (4, 5, 7)>, <2, (4, 6, 7)>, <2, (5, 6, 7)>, <4, (2, 9, 6)>, <4, (2, 9, 7)>, <4, (5, 9, 6)>, <4, (5, 9, 7)>, <6, (2, 9, 4)>, <6, (2, 9, 7)>, <6, (4, 9, 7)>, <7, (2, 9, 4)>, <7, (2, 9, 6)>, <7, (4, 9, 6)>]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [14].
