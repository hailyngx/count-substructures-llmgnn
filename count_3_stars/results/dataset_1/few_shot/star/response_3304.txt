Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 7

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

The total number of 3-stars can be determined by considering each node as the center of a potential 3-star and checking how many such 3-stars can be formed around that node. 

Here are the steps to find the number of 3-stars in this graph:
1. Nodes 0, 1, 3, 5, and 6 do not form any 3-stars as they have fewer than 3 adjacent nodes.
2. Node 2 would form a 3-star with nodes 4, 5, and 7.
3. Node 4 would form a 3-star with nodes 1, 2, and 8.
4. Node 7 would form 3-stars with nodes 0, 1, 2 and node 9.
5. Node 8 would also form a 3-star with nodes 1, 2, and 4.
6. Node 9 would not form any 3-star as it has fewer than 3 adjacent nodes.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].

Unique 3-stars found: <2, (4, 5, 7)>, <4, (1, 2, 8)>, <7, (0, 1, 2)>, <8, (1, 2, 4)>.
