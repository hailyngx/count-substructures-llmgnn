Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 9
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a 3-star pattern.

The possible 3-star configurations in this graph are:
<0, (3, 4, 9)>
<2, (5, 8, 9)>
<3, (0, 9, 4)>
<4, (0, 9, 3)>
<5, (2, 8, 9)>
<8, (2, 5, 9)>
<9, (0, 3, 4)>
<9, (0, 4, 8)>
<9, (3, 4, 8)>
<9, (8, 2, 5)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
