Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 6) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the nodes that form 3-stars around each central node. Since a 3-star consists of a central node and three connected nodes, we will examine each node in the graph to see if it forms a 3-star with its neighboring nodes. 

Here are the 3-stars in the given graph:
[3]

<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<2, (1, 4, 5)>
<4, (2, 3, 6)>
<6, (2, 3, 7)> 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
