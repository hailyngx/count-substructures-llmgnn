Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 8

Response:
After examining the given graph, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph: 

There are [<0, (4, 5, 6)>, <3, (4, 6, 7)>, and <6, (0, 2, 3)>]. 

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
