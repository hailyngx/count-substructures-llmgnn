Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

From the given information, the nodes that satisfy this condition are:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 6, 7
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 8
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 6

Thus, there are a total of [3] 3-stars in the graph.

<0, (3, 6, 7)>
<2, (4, 5, 8)>
<5, (2, 4, 6)>
