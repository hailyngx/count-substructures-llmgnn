Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 4
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star patterns in the graph:

<0, (5, 6, 4)>
<4, (5, 6, 8)>

Now, calculate the total number of 3-stars in the graph by counting the occurrences of each unique 3-star:
