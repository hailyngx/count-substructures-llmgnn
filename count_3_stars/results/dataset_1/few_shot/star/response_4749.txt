Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 6, and node 7

Response:
The nodes in the given graph are connected in the following way with each edge specified: 
(0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) 
(1, 3) (1, 8) 
(2, 5) (2, 8) 
(3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) 
(4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) 
(5, 2) (5, 6) 
(6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) 
(7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) 
(8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) 
(9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7)

Now, let's find the 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (4, 8, 9)>
<3, (1, 4, 6)>
<6, (3, 5, 7)>

Count of 3-stars: [3]
