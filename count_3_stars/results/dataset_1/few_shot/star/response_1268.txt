Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 5
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- From the adjacency list, we can see that there are no 3-stars involving node 9 since it is not connected to any other nodes.

- We can see that the following 3-stars exist in the graph:
    <0, (1, 4, 6)>
    <1, (0, 6, 8)>
    <2, (4, 5, 7)>
    <3, (8)>
    <4, (0, 2, 5)>
    <5, (2, 4, 8)>
    <6, (0, 1)>
    <7, (0, 2)>
    <8, (1, 3, 5)>
  
By counting the number of unique 3-stars found, we get a total of 9. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
