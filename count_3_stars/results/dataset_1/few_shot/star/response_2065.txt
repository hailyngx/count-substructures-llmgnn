Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 8

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star in the graph. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Let's list out the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<1, (0, 6, 7)>
<2, (0, 3, 6)>
<3, (1, 2, 9)>
<4, (3, 7, 9)>
<5, (0, 6, 9)>
<6, (0, 1, 2)>
<7, (1, 2, 3)>
<8, (5, 9)>
<9, (2, 3, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
