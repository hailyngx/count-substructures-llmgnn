Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 5

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a star pattern. 

Let's list the 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<0, (1, 3, 8)>
<0, (3, 4, 8)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<3, (0, 1, 5)>
<3, (0, 5, 9)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we find a total of [6].
