Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 9
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the unique 3-stars in the graph. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we can see that the center node of a 3-star can only be a node with at least 3 connections. Nodes 0, 1, 7, and 9 satisfy this condition.

Now, let's identify the possible 3-stars centered at the nodes with at least 3 connections:

- For node 0: <0, (1, 4, 7)>
- For node 1: <1, (0, 5, 7)>
- For node 7: <7, (0, 1, 9)>
- For node 9: <9, (0, 5, 7)>, <9, (3, 5, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5]. 
<0, (1, 4, 7)>, <1, (0, 5, 7)>, <7, (0, 1, 9)>, <9, (0, 5, 7)>, <9, (3, 5, 7)>
