Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a star pattern with that node as the center.

Based on the adjacency list provided, we can identify the following 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (5, 8, 1)>
<3, (5, 6, 7)>
<7, (3, 6, 8)>
