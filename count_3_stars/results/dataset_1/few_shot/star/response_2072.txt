Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. These instances represent 3-star structures with the given node as the center and the three connected nodes as the leaves.

Looking at the adjacency list, we find the following 3-stars:
<0, (6, 8, 4)>
<2, (3, 4, 6)>
<4, (2, 3, 8)>
<8, (0, 4, 6)>
<9, (3, 4, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5]. 
<0, (6, 8, 4)> <2, (3, 4, 6)> <4, (2, 3, 8)> <8, (0, 4, 6)> <9, (3, 4, 5)>
