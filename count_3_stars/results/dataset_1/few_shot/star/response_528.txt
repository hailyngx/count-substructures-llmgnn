Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars, we need to identify all possible combinations of a central node and three other nodes that are directly connected to the central node. Let's go step by step:

1. Based on the given graph, here are the possible 3-stars we can identify:
   - Node 0: <0, (3, 4, 5)>
   - Node 1: <1, (2, 4, 8)>
   - Node 2: <2, (1, 4, 6)>
   - Node 4: <4, (0, 1, 2)>
   - Node 6: <6, (0, 2, 3)>
   - Node 9: <9, (4, 5, 6)>

2. The number of 3-stars in this graph is the count of unique combinations listed above.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
