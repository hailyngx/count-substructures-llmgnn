Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star-like pattern.

Looking at the adjacency list provided:
- Node 0, 1, 4, 7 have degree (number of neighbors) greater than 3, so they cannot be the center of a 3-star.
- Nodes 2, 5, 8, 9 have degree less than 3, so they cannot be the center of a 3-star.
- Node 6 has a degree of 3, and it is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 4, forming a 3-star. 
- Node 3 has a degree of 6 and is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 8. Node 3 is the center of another 3-star since it is connected to exactly 3 other nodes (0, 2, 4) in a star pattern.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].

<6, (1, 3, 4)>, <3, (0, 2, 4)>
