Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify sets of four nodes where one node is connected to the other three nodes, forming a 3-star configuration. Let's go through each node to find all 3-stars:

Node 0: No 3-star here.
Node 1: No 3-star here.
Node 2: No 3-star here.
Node 3: 1 possible 3-star: <3, (0, 6, 7)>
Node 4: No 3-star here.
Node 5: No 3-star here.
Node 6: No 3-star here.
Node 7: 1 possible 3-star: <7, (0, 3, 4)>
Node 8: No 3-star here.
Node 9: No 3-star here.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].  
The unique 3-stars are: <3, (0, 6, 7)>, <7, (0, 3, 4)>.
