Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 3

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars present. 

Looking at the adjacency lists, we can identify the nodes connected in 3-star formations. We find the following 3-stars: 
<2, (0, 6, 9)>
<3, (6, 7, 8)> 

These are the only 3-stars in the graph. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
