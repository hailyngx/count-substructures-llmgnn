Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 4

Response:
On analyzing the given graph, we can identify the 3-stars as follows:

1. <0, (2, 4, 6)>
2. <1, (2, 4, 8)>
3. <4, (0, 1, 9)>
4. <4, (3, 7, 9)>
5. <6, (0, 7, 8)>
6. <8, (1, 5, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
