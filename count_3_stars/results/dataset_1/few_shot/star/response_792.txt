Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 7, and node 8

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are as follows:
<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<1, (0, 5, 8)>
<1, (5, 7, 9)>
<3, (0, 5, 7)>
<5, (0, 1, 3)>
<5, (1, 3, 7)>
<7, (1, 3, 5)>
<8, (0, 1, 9)>
<9, (1, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
