Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, and node 7

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

Based on the adjacency list, we can see that the possible central nodes for 3-stars are: 2, 6, 7, and 9.

For node 2:
- <2, (0, 1, 4)>
- <2, (0, 1, 7)>
- <2, (0, 4, 7)>
- <2, (1, 4, 7)>
- <2, (8, 4, 7)>
- <2, (8, 7, 9)>
- <2, (1, 8, 9)>

For node 6:
- <6, (0, 1, 3)>
- <6, (0, 1, 5)>
- <6, (0, 3, 5)>
- <6, (1, 3, 5)>
- <6, (3, 5, 9)>
- <6, (1, 5, 9)>
- <6, (0, 9, 5)>

For node 7:
- <7, (2, 4, 8)>
- <7, (2, 4, 9)>
- <7, (2, 8, 9)>
- <7, (4, 8, 9)>
- <7, (2, 8, 0)>
- <7, (4, 8, 0)>
- <7, (2, 8, 6)>

For node 9:
- <9, (2, 3, 6)>
- <9, (2, 3, 7)>
- <9, (2, 6, 7)>
- <9, (3, 6, 7)>
- <9, (2, 6, 0)>
- <9, (3, 6, 0)>
- <9, (2, 6, 1)>

So, there are 21 3-stars in the given graph.
