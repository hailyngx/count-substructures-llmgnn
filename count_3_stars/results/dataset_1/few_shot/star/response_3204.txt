Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 4, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 5, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node and its adjacent nodes. Then, we can determine if they form a 3-star structure.

Let's start by looking at each node and its neighbors to find all possible 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 0: No 3-star since it has less than 3 neighbors.
2. Node 1: No 3-star since it has less than 3 neighbors.
3. Node 2: 
    - Possible 3-star: <2, (3, 4, 5)>
4. Node 3: 
    - Possible 3-star: <3, (0, 1, 2)>, <3, (2, 4, 7)>
5. Node 4: No 3-star since it has less than 3 neighbors.
6. Node 5: No 3-star since it has less than 3 neighbors.
7. Node 6: No 3-star since it has less than 3 neighbors.
8. Node 7: No 3-star since it has less than 3 neighbors.
9. Node 8:
    - Possible 3-star: <8, (1, 2, 4)>, <8, (2, 4, 9)>
10. Node 9: No 3-star since it has less than 3 neighbors.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].

<2, (3, 4, 5)>, <8, (1, 2, 4)>, <8, (2, 4, 9)>
