Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 3) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 3

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify all possible 3-stars. 

Given the definition of a 3-star, we need to find all possible combinations where a node is the center and three other nodes are connected to it.

Potential 3-stars:
<1, (0, 2, 4)>
<1, (0, 2, 9)>
<1, (4, 9, 3)>
<3, (2, 6, 9)>

There are a total of 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
Therefore, the final answer is [4].
