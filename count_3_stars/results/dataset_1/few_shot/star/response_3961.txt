Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes with each unique set of connections forming a 3-star. 

Given the adjacency list:

1. Node 1 has connections with nodes 2, 3, 4, and 8.
2. Node 2 has connections with nodes 1 and 6.
3. Node 3 has connections with nodes 1 and 6.
4. Node 4 has connections with nodes 1 and 7.
5. Node 5 has a connection with node 6.
6. Node 6 has connections with nodes 2, 3, and 5.
7. Node 7 has a connection with node 4.
8. Node 8 has connections with nodes 1 and 9.
9. Node 9 has a connection with node 8.

We can identify the following 3-stars in the graph:

<1, (2, 3, 4)>
<1, (2, 3, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
