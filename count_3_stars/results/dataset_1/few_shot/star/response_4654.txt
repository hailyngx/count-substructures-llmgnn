Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 7

Response:
From the given information, we can first identify the nodes that are part of 3-stars. Since a 3-star has one central node and three leaf nodes, we look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

Nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes are:
- Node 0 (connected to nodes 1, 2, and 8)
- Node 2 (connected to nodes 0, 9, and not recorded in the adjacency list)
- Node 5 (connected to only node 8)

Next, we can identify all the 3-stars in the graph:
- <0, (1, 2, 8)>
- <2, (0, 9, not recorded in the adjacency list)>
- <5, (8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: <<0, 1, 2, 8>, <2, 0, 9, not recorded in the adjacency list>, <5, 8>>.
