Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique occurrences of a 3-star structure, where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Based on the given graph and the definition of a 3-star graph, we can identify the following unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<1, (0, 3, 5)>
<1, (5, 6, 9)>
<4, (0, 5, 6)>
<5, (1, 4, 6)>
<6, (1, 4, 5)>
<8, (4, 6, 7)>
 
Count of 3-stars: [7]
