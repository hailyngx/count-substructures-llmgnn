Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern.

Looking at the graph:
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 5, forming a 3-star with center 2 and leaves 1, 3, 5. <2, (1, 3, 5)>
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 7, forming a 3-star with center 3 and leaves 2, 5, 7. <3, (2, 5, 7)>
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 6, forming a 3-star with center 7 and leaves 3, 5, 6. <7, (3, 5, 6)>
- Node 7 is also connected to nodes 5, 8, and 9, forming another 3-star with center 7 and leaves 5, 8, 9. <7, (5, 8, 9)>

Therefore, there are a total of [3] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
