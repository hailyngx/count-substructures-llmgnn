Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 2

Response:
Step 1: Identify 3-stars
- Check each node if it is the center of a 3-star graph. 
- A 3-star graph has a center node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Step 2: Count the 3-stars
- Once all 3-stars are identified, count the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph.

Let's start with Node 0 and go through each node to identify the 3-stars.

Node 0:
- Node 0 is not the center of a 3-star.

Node 1:
- Node 1 is not the center of a 3-star.

Node 2:
- <2, (1, 4, 5)> 
- <2, (4, 7, 9)>

Node 3:
- Node 3 is not the center of a 3-star.

Node 4:
- Node 4 is not the center of a 3-star.

Node 5:
- Node 5 is not the center of a 3-star.

Node 6:
- Node 6 is not the center of a 3-star.

Node 7:
- Node 7 is not the center of a 3-star.

Node 8:
- Node 8 is not the center of a 3-star.

Node 9:
- Node 9 is not the center of a 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found are <2, (1, 4, 5)> and <2, (4, 7, 9)>.
