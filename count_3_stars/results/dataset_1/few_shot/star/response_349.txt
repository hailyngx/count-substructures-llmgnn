Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 4) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 6
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are as follows:

<1, (5, 4, 6)>
<6, (4, 5, 8)>
