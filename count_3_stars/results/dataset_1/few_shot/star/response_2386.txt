Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step-by-step to find the 3-stars:

1. Nodes connected to exactly three other nodes:
   - Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 7, and 8.
   - Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 8, and no other node.
   - Node 4 is connected to nodes 6, 8, and no other node.
   - Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 6, and 8.
   - Node 9 is connected to only node 8.

2. Identify 3-stars:
   - <0, (3, 7, 8)>
   - <3, (0, 8, 4)>
   - <4, (6, 8, 0)>
   - <7, (0, 6, 8)>
   - <9, (8, 6, 4)>

Count of 3-stars: [5]
Unique 3-stars: <0, (3, 7, 8)> <3, (0, 8, 4)> <4, (6, 8, 0)> <7, (0, 6, 8)> <9, (8, 6, 4)>
