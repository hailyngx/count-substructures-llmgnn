Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 8

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to three other nodes forming a 3-star pattern with the center node. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Identify nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
   - Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 6, 7 which forms a 3-star with Node 1 as the center: <1, (0, 6, 7)>
   - Node 3 is connected to nodes 6, 7, 8 which forms a 3-star with Node 3 as the center: <3, (6, 7, 8)>
   - Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 7 which forms a 3-star with Node 6 as the center: <6, (1, 3, 7)>
   - Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 6, 9 which forms a 3-star with Node 8 as the center: <8, (1, 6, 9)>

2. Calculate the total number of unique 3-stars found: [4]

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
