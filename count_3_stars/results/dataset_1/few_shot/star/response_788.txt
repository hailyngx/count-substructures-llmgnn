Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-star structures. A 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list all the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<0, (1, 8, 9)>
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<4, (0, 7, 9)>
<5, (3, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 2, 5)>
<8, (4, 5, 7)>
<9, (0, 4, 5)>

Count of 3-stars: [8]
