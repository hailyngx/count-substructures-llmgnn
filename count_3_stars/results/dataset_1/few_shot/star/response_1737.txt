Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 6

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- From node 0: <0, (1, 5, 8)>
- From node 1: <1, (0, 7, 9)>
- From node 2: <2, (5, 6, 8)>
- From node 3: <3, (4, 7, 8)>
- From node 6: <6, (2, 5, 7)>
- From node 9: <9, (1, 2, 4)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we have a total of [6] 3-stars in the graph.
