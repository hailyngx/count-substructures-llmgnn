Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, and node 6

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph. 

1. Node 0: <0, (2, 3, 5)>
2. Node 3: <3, (0, 5, 7)>
3. Node 5: <5, (0, 3, 9)>
4. Node 8: <8, (1, 2, 4)> and <8, (3, 7, 8)>

Therefore, there are [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
