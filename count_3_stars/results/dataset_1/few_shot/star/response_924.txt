Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Looking at the adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars:

<1, (2, 4, 5)>
<2, (1, 5, 8)>
<4, (1, 8, 9)>
<5, (0, 1, 2)>
<8, (0, 2, 4)>
<9, (2, 4, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
