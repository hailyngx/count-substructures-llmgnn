Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes; these are the 3-stars in the graph. Let's go through the adjacency list to find them:

- There are no 3-stars centered at Node 0.
- <1, (2, 4, 6)> is a 3-star centered at Node 1.
- There are no 3-stars centered at Node 2.
- There are no 3-stars centered at Node 3.
- <4, (1, 2, 6)> is a 3-star centered at Node 4.
- <5, (1, 7, 8)> is a 3-star centered at Node 5.
- There are no 3-stars centered at Node 6.
- There are no 3-stars centered at Node 7.
- There are no 3-stars centered at Node 8.
- There are no 3-stars centered at Node 9.

Therefore, there are two 3-stars in the given graph. 

So, the final answer is [2].

Unique 3-stars found:
<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<5, (1, 7, 8)>
