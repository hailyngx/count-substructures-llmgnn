Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique instance of a 3-star, which consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (7, 9)>
<2, (4, 6, 9)>
<3, (5, 7, 9)>
<6, (2, 5, 8)>
<9, (0, 3, 4)>

There are a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
