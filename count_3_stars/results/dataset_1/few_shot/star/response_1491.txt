Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 6

Response:
Let's first identify the 3-stars in the graph based on the description provided.

The 3-stars in the given graph are:
<2, (6, 7, 9)>
<3, (0, 6, 9)>
<6, (2, 3, 9)>
<7, (1, 4, 8)>
<8, (1, 5, 7)>
<9, (2, 3, 6)>

Now let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph.
