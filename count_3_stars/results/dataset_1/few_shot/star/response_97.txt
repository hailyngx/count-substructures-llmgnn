Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 46 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8)

Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 6, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars present in the graph.

Based on the definition of a 3-star graph, we are looking for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (1, 6, 9)>
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<2, (1, 3, 5)>
<3, (1, 2, 5)>
<6, (0, 1, 3)>
<7, (1, 3, 9)>
<8, (2, 3, 9)>
<9, (0, 6, 7)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the given graph: [8].
