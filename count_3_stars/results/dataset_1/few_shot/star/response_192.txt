Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 7

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph. 

Looking at the graph and given information, we can identify the following 3-star structures:
<0, (1, 3, 9)>
<0, (4, 7, 9)>
<1, (0, 2, 4)>
<2, (1, 5, 8)>
<3, (0, 7, 9)>
<4, (0, 1, 6)>
<5, (2, 9)>
<6, (4, 7)>
<7, (0, 3, 9)>
<8, (2, 3)>
<9, (0, 3, 5)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-star graphs in the given graph:
Total number of 3-star graphs: [11]
