Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 4

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the unique 3-stars present in the graph.

Looking at the definition of a 3-star graph, we can see that a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars in the graph:
<1, (5, 6, 7)>
<3, (5, 8, 0)>
<4, (7, 9, 0)>

Now, we count the number of unique 3-stars in the graph:
