Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we can see that nodes 0, 1, 4, 6, and 9 are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's find the 3-star configurations for each of these nodes:

For node 0:
- <0, (3, 6)>

For node 1:
- <1, (3, 9)>

For node 4:
- <4, (3, 5)>

For node 6:
- <6, (0, 5)>
- <6, (5, 7)>

For node 9:
- <9, (1, 3)>
- <9, (3, 5)>

Counting the unique 3-stars found:
