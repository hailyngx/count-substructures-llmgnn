Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern. 

Let's go through the nodes to find the 3-stars:
1. Node 1 is connected to nodes 4 and 6. Checking if it forms a 3-star: 
    - <1, (4, 6)>
2. Node 2 is connected to nodes 4 and 6. Checking if it forms a 3-star:
    - <2, (4, 6)>
3. Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 5, and 6. Checking if it forms 3-stars:
    - <4, (1, 2, 5)>
    - <4, (1, 2, 6)>
4. Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, and 8. Checking if it forms 3-stars:
    - <6, (1, 2, 3)>
    - <6, (1, 2, 8)>
    
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6]. 
The unique 3-stars found are <1, (4, 6)>, <2, (4, 6)>, <4, (1, 2, 5)>, <4, (1, 2, 6)>, <6, (1, 2, 3)>, <6, (1, 2, 8)>.
