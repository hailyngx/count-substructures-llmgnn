Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 8

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph. 
A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Nodes with 3 edges:
- Nodes 0, 1, and 8 are potential central nodes for 3-stars. 

Let's check for each potential central node:
1. For node 0:
   - <0, (1, 7, 8)> is a 3-star. (Central node 0 connected to nodes 1, 7, and 8)

2. For node 1:
   - <1, (0, 5, 6)> is a 3-star. (Central node 1 connected to nodes 0, 5, and 6)

3. For node 8:
   - <8, (0, 3, 6)> is a 3-star. (Central node 8 connected to nodes 0, 3, and 6)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
Unique 3-stars: <0, (1, 7, 8)>, <1, (0, 5, 6)>, <8, (0, 3, 6)>
