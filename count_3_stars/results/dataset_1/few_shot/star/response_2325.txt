Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 5, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we can identify each 3-star by examining each node and its connections to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through each node one by one:

1. For Node 0, it forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 4, and 7. So, we have one 3-star <0, (1, 4, 7)>.

2. For Node 2, it forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 4, and 7. So, we have one 3-star <2, (3, 4, 7)>.

3. For Node 4, it forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 2, and 8. So, we have one 3-star <4, (0, 2, 8)>.

4. For Node 5, it forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 6, and 9. So, we have one 3-star <5, (3, 6, 9)>.

5. For Node 7, it forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 2, and 9. So, we have one 3-star <7, (0, 2, 9)>.

6. For Node 8, it forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 4, and 9. So, we have one 3-star <8, (0, 4, 9)>.

Overall, there are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph, therefore the final answer is [6]. 

<0, (1, 4, 7)> <2, (3, 4, 7)> <4, (0, 2, 8)> <5, (3, 6, 9)> <7, (0, 2, 9)> <8, (0, 4, 9)>
