Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star pattern. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<2, (3, 4, 7)>
<3, (1, 2, 6)>
<3, (2, 4, 9)>
<4, (0, 2, 6)>
<4, (2, 3, 7)>
<5, (0, 1, 8)>
<7, (2, 4, 8)>
<8, (2, 5, 9)>
