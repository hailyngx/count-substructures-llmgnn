Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 4, and node 6

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are as follows:
<0, (2, 9, 1)>
<1, (2, 8, 3)>
<2, (0, 1, 4)>
<2, (0, 1, 8)>
<2, (1, 4, 9)>
<4, (2, 9, 8)>
<6, (8, 9, 7)>

Thus, the total number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [7].
