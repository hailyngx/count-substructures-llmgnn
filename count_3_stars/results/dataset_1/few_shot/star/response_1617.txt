Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 5

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 2, and 8: <0, (1, 2, 8)>
- Node 0 forms another 3-star with nodes 1, 8, and 9: <0, (1, 8, 9)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 2, and 5: <1, (0, 2, 5)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 8, and 9: <3, (4, 8, 9)>
- Node 4 forms another 3-star with nodes 3, 8, and 9: <4, (3, 8, 9)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 3, and 4: <9, (0, 3, 4)>

Counting all unique 3-stars found, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
