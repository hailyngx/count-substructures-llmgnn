Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, 6, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star configuration.

Looking at the provided information, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (3, 8, 9)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<4, (3, 6, 7)>
<6, (2, 4, 5)>
<9, (4, 5, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5]. 
The unique 3-stars are <0, (3, 8, 9)>, <3, (0, 1, 2)>, <4, (3, 6, 7)>, <6, (2, 4, 5)>, and <9, (4, 5, 8)>.
