Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 7

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the graph. Central nodes are nodes with exactly three neighbors. In this graph, nodes 0, 3, and 7 are central nodes. 

Next, we will look at each central node and count the number of 3-stars they participate in:

For Node 0:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 5, 6, and 7.
- Possible 3-star combinations involving node 0:
  - <0, (1, 3, 7)>
  - <0, (1, 3, 6)>
  - Total = 2

For Node 3:
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, 8, and 9.
- Possible 3-star combinations involving node 3:
  - <3, (0, 1, 9)>
  - Total = 1

For Node 7:
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0 and 9.
- Possible 3-star combinations involving node 7:
  - <7, (0, 9, -)>
  - Total = 1

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4]. 
The unique 3-stars are: <0, (1, 3, 7)>, <0, (1, 3, 6)>, <3, (0, 1, 9)>, and <7, (0, 9, -)>.
