Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, 6, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we can identify all the possible combinations of 3-stars by checking each node as the potential center of the star and its neighbors as the connected leaves. We'll then check if these combinations form valid 3-stars based on the given edges.

Here is the list of unique 3-stars found in the given graph:
<2, (4, 5, 9)>
<3, (4, 7, 9)>
<5, (6, 7, 8)>
<6, (7, 8, 9)>
<7, (5, 6, 9)>
<8, (5, 6, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
