Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5
