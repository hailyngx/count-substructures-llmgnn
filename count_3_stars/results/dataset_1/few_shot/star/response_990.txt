Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern. 

From the given information, we can observe the following unique 3-stars: <0, (2, 3, 5)>, <1, (4, 7, 8)>, <2, (0, 6, 9)>, <3, (0, 6, 9)>, <4, (1, 7, 8)>, <5, (0, 7, 8)>, <6, (2, 3)>, <7, (4, 5, 8)>, <8, (4, 5, 7)>, <9, (2, 3, 5)>.

There are 10 unique 3-stars in total. Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
