Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible connections where a node has exactly three edges connecting it to three other nodes.

Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

<0, (2, 6, 8)>
<1, (3, 4, 8)>
<2, (0, 3, 6)>
<2, (0, 6, 8)>
<2, (3, 6, 9)>
<3, (1, 2, 9)>
<3, (2, 5, 9)>
<4, (1, 5, 8)>
<4, (5, 8, 9)>
<8, (1, 4, 6)>
<8, (2, 4, 6)>
<9, (2, 4, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [11].
