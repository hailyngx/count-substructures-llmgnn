Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, 7, and node 8

Response:
The 3-stars in this graph can be found by looking for nodes connected to exactly three other nodes. Here are the unique 3-stars:

<0, (1, 3, 9)>
<1, (0, 2, 4)>
<3, (0, 5, 6)>
<4, (1, 5, 7)>
<5, (3, 4, 6)>
<7, (1, 4, 9)>
<8, (3, 4, 9)>
<9, (0, 5, 8)>

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
