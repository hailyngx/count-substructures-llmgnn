Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8)

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the central nodes and their adjacent nodes. 

Central nodes in a 3-star graph have degree 3. Since the graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges, we can identify the central nodes based on their degree. 

Let's list the central nodes with their adjacent nodes:

- Central node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 6, and 8.
- Central node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 6, 7, and 8.
- Central node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 6, 7, and 9.
- Central node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 8, and 9.
- Central node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, 5, and 9.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:

- For central node 1: <1, (2, 4, 6)>, <1, (2, 4, 8)>
- For central node 2: <2, (1, 6, 7)>, <2, (1, 6, 8)>, <2, (1, 7, 8)>
- For central node 3: <3, (0, 6, 7)>, <3, (0, 6, 9)>, <3, (0, 7, 9)>
- For central node 4: <4, (1, 5, 8)>, <4, (1, 8, 9)>, <4, (5, 8, 9)>
- For central node 8: <8, (1, 4, 5)>, <8, (1, 4, 9)>, <8, (1, 5, 9)>, <8, (4, 5, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
