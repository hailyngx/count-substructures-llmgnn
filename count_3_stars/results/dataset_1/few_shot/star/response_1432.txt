Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern with that node as the center.

Looking at the adjacency relationships given:

- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, and 9: <0, (1, 3, 9)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 6, and 8: <4, (5, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
