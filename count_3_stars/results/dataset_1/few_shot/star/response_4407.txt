Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the 3-star configurations where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Looking at the adjacency list for each node and based on the definition of a 3-star graph, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<1, (2, 3, 5)>
<1, (3, 5, 6)>
<1, (2, 5, 9)>
<6, (0, 1, 7)>
<6, (1, 8, 9)>
<7, (0, 6, 8)>
<8, (3, 6, 9)>
<9, (1, 5, 6)>

Counting the unique 3-stars found, we have a total of [8] 3-stars.
