Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 2

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star structures in the given graph.

1. For Node 0:
   - <0, (3, 7)>
   
2. For Node 2:
   - <2, (5, 9)>

3. For Node 3:
   - <3, (0, 5)>
   
4. For Node 4:
   - <4, (1, 6)>
   
5. For Node 6:
   - <6, (4, 7)>
   
6. For Node 7:
   - <7, (0, 6)>

Thus, there are a total of [6] 3-star structures in the graph.
