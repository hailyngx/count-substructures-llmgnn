Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that has exactly 3 edges connected to it, forming a 3-star configuration.

Looking at the adjacency list for each node, we find the following 3-stars:
<0, (2, 8, 4)>
<3, (4, 5, 9)>
<8, (0, 6, 9)>

Therefore, there are a total of [3] 3-stars in the given graph.
