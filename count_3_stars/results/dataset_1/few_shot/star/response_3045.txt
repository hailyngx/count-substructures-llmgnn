Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes. Let's go through the nodes to identify the 3-stars:

1. Node 0: Node 0 is connected to nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9. None of these connections form a 3-star.

2. Node 1: Node 1 is connected to nodes 5 and 9. This does not form a 3-star.

3. Node 2: Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 7, and 9. This forms a 3-star: <2, (3, 7, 9)>.

4. Node 3: Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 6. This does not form a 3-star.

5. Node 4: Node 4 is connected to node 9. This does not form a 3-star.

6. Node 5: Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 6, 8, and 9. This does not form a 3-star.

7. Node 6: Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 5, and 8. None of these connections form a 3-star.

8. Node 7: Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 8. None of these connections form a 3-star.

9. Node 8: Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 5, 6, 7, and 9. This does not form a 3-star.

10. Node 9: Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, and 8. This does not form a 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1].
The unique 3-star found is <2, (3, 7, 9)>.
