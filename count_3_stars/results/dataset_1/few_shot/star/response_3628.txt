Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all unique instances of the 3-star configuration, which consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Looking at the graph, we can identify the following 3-star configurations:
<0, (1, 6, 9)>
<1, (0, 4, 9)>
<3, (2, 6, 9)>
<4, (1, 5, 8)>
<5, (4, 7, 8)>
<6, (0, 3, 8)>
<8, (4, 5, 9)>
<9, (1, 7, 8)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars found, we have a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
