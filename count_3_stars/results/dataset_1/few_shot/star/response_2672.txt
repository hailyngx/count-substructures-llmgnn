Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 5

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all unique sets of 3 nodes connected in a star pattern around a central node. 

Let's analyze the graph:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 2, 3, 4, and 9.
- Node 1 has 0 neighbors.
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors: 0 and 9.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 0, 5, 7, and 9.
- Node 4 has 1 neighbor: 0.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 3, 7, 8, and 9.
- Node 6 has 0 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors: 3 and 5.
- Node 8 has 1 neighbor: 5.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 0, 2, 3, and 5.

Now we can count the number of 3-stars. Below are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (2, 3, 9)>
<3, (0, 5, 7)>
<5, (3, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
