Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 7
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 8

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 26 edges, let's find the number of 3-star subgraphs.

We can identify 3-star subgraphs by looking for nodes that have exactly three neighbors connected to them. Let's list the unique 3-stars:

<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<1, (0, 5, 7)>
<3, (0, 4, 8)>
<5, (0, 1, 7)>
<7, (1, 5, 8)>
<8, (3, 7, 9)>
<9, (0, 8)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we have a total of [7] 3-star subgraphs in the given graph.
