Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 7

Response:
Let's go through each node and identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 0: No 3-star as it is only connected to 2 nodes.
2. Node 1: <1, (2, 4, 6)>
3. Node 2: <2, (1, 8, 9)>
4. Node 3: No 3-star as it is only connected to 1 node.
5. Node 4: No 3-star as it is only connected to 2 nodes.
6. Node 5: No 3-star as it is only connected to 1 node.
7. Node 6: <6, (0, 1, 8)> and <6, (0, 8, 9)>
8. Node 7: No 3-star as it is only connected to 2 nodes.
9. Node 8: <8, (0, 2, 6)> and <8, (7, 9, 6)>
10. Node 9: No 3-star as it is only connected to 2 nodes.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4]. 
The unique 3-stars are <1, (2, 4, 6)>, <2, (1, 8, 9)>, <6, (0, 1, 8)>, and <8, (0, 2, 6)>.
