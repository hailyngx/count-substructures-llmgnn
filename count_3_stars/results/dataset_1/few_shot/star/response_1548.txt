Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes (forming a 3-star). 

Let's find the 3-stars in this graph step by step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 6: <0, (2, 4, 6)>
2. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 4: <2, (0, 3, 4)>
3. Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 6: <3, (1, 2, 6)>
4. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 2: <4, (0, 1, 2)>
5. Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 4: <6, (0, 3, 4)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
