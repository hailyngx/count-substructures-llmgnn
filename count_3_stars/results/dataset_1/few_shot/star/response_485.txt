Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star by finding the central node and its three leaves. 

Let's go through the adjacency list for each node: 
1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, and 7
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0 and 7
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 3 and 9
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 5, 7, and 9
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 6, 7, and 9
6. Node 5 is connected to node 3
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 4, 8, and 9
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, and 8
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 6, 7, and 9
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8

Now, let's list down the unique 3-stars present in the graph:
<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<0, (1, 3, 7)>
<0, (3, 4, 7)>
<3, (0, 2, 5)>
<3, (0, 4, 9)>
<4, (0, 6, 7)>
<4, (0, 7, 9)>
<6, (4, 8, 9)>
<7, (0, 1, 8)>
<7, (3, 4, 8)>
<8, (6, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [11].
