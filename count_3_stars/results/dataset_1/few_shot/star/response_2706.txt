Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 9
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, and node 8

Response:
Based on the given information, the 3-stars in the graph can be identified as follows:

<0, (3, 5, 8)>
<2, (3, 9, 8)>
<3, (0, 2, 9)>
<5, (0, 6, 8)>
<6, (5, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 6, 9)>
<9, (2, 3, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
