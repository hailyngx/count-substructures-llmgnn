Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 3

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we see that the center node must have exactly 3 neighbors for it to form a 3-star. Let's analyze each node:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 3, 7, 8  <0, (3, 7, 8)> 
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors: 2, 5 
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors: 1, 4 
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors: 0, 5, 7, 8, 9  <3, (0, 7, 8)> 
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 2, 5, 6  <4, (2, 5, 6)> 
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 1, 3, 4 <5, (1, 3, 4)>  
- Node 6 has 1 neighbor: 4 
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors: 0, 3 
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors: 0, 3 
- Node 9 has 1 neighbor: 3  

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in this graph are: <0, (3, 7, 8)>, <3, (0, 7, 8)>, <4, (2, 5, 6)>, and <5, (1, 3, 4)>.

Since we have found 4 unique 3-stars, the final answer is [4].
