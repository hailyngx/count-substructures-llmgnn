Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 8

Response:
The central node in a 3-star will have degree 3 and will be connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0: Degree 3, connected to nodes 5, 6, and 9
- Node 1: Degree 3, connected to nodes 3, 5, and 7
- Node 3: Degree 5, connected to nodes 1, 2, 5, 6, and 7
- Node 5: Degree 4, connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, and 4
- Node 7: Degree 4, connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, and 8
- Node 8: Degree 3, connected to nodes 4, 7, and 9

So, the 3-stars in this graph are:

<0, (5, 6, 9)>
<1, (3, 5, 7)>
<7, (1, 3, 4)>
