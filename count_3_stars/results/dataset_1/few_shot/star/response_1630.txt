Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 8

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-star subgraphs:
[2]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
