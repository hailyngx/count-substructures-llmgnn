Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 7
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 8

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph.

From the adjacency list, we can see that nodes 1, 4, and 7 are the centers of the possible 3-stars because they have exactly 3 connections each. Let's list down the 3-stars for each center:

For center node 1:
<1, (7, 4, 9)>

For center node 4:
<4, (7, 1, 9)>

For center node 7:
<7, (1, 4, 9)>

Therefore, there are [3] 3-stars in the given graph.
