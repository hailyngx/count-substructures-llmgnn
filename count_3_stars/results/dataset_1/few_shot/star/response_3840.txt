Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the central nodes and their connected nodes. Let's list all the 3-stars present in the graph:

<0, (5, 8)>
<1, (6, 8)>
<2, (3, 4, 6)>
<3, (2, 4)>
<4, (2, 3, 6)>
<6, (1, 2, 4)>
<6, (2, 4, 9)>
<8, (0, 1, 7)>
<9, (4, 6)>

Now we count the number of unique 3-stars in the graph: [9]
