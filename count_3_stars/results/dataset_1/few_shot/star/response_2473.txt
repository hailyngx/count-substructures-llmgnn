Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that has exactly 3 neighbors.

From the given adjacency list:
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors.

Now, let's identify the unique 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (5, 6, 9)>
<1, (3, 7, 9)>
<3, (1, 2, 4)>
<3, (6, 7, 8)>
<4, (3, 7, 8)>
<8, (3, 4, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
