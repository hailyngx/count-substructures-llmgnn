Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

In this particular graph, a 3-star can be formed by taking each node as the center and its adjacent nodes as the leaves. Let's list all the unique 3-stars: 

<0, (1, 3, 9)>
<1, (0, 9, 9)>
<2, (7, 9, 9)>
<3, (0, 5, 6)>
<4, (7, 9, 9)>
<5, (3, 6, 9)>
<6, (3, 5, 9)>
<7, (2, 4, 8)>
<8, (7, 7, 7)>
<9, (0, 1, 2)>
<9, (4, 5, 6)>

Count of 3-stars: [10]
