Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 8
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

From the adjacency list, we can see the connections for each node:

- Node 0 is a 3-star center with nodes 2, 4, and 8 as leaves.
- Node 1 is a 3-star center with nodes 4, 7, and 9 as leaves.
- Node 2 is a 3-star center with nodes 0, 4, and 7 as leaves.
- Node 4 is a 3-star center with nodes 0, 1, and 2 as leaves.
- Node 7 is a 3-star center with nodes 1, 2, and 9 as leaves.

Therefore, we have the following unique 3-stars:
<0, (2, 4, 8)>
<1, (4, 7, 9)>
<2, (0, 4, 7)>
<4, (0, 1, 2)>
<7, (1, 2, 9)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
