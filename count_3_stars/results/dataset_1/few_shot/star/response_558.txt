Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will look for each possible 3-star with a central node and three leaves. Here are the unique 3-stars in the graph along with their counts inside brackets:

<0, (2, 4, 6)> [1]
<0, (2, 4, 8)> [1]
<0, (2, 6, 8)> [1]
<4, (0, 5, 8)> [1]
<4, (5, 8, 9)> [1]
<8, (0, 4, 5)> [1]
<8, (4, 5, 6)> [1]
<2, (0, 5, 6)> [1]
<2, (5, 6, 7)> [1]
<5, (2, 4, 8)> [1]
