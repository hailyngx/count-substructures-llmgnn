Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 0) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 7

Response:
Based on the given information, let's find all the 3-stars in the graph:

- From node 0: <0, (1, 5, 6)>
- From node 1: <1, (0, 7, 8)>
- From node 5: <5, (0, 4, 8)>
- From node 7: <7, (1, 6, 9)>

There are a total of [4] 3-stars in the given graph.
