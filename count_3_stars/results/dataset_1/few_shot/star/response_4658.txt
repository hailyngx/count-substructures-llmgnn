Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 7) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 4, 6, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through the nodes one by one:

1. Node 0: Not a 3-star as it is connected to four other nodes.
2. Node 1: Not a 3-star as it is connected to only one other node.
3. Node 2: Not a 3-star as it is connected to only one other node.
4. Node 3: Not a 3-star as it is connected to two other nodes.
5. Node 4: 3-star found with center at node 4 and leaves at nodes 0, 6, and 9. <4, (0, 6, 9)>
6. Node 5: Not a 3-star as it is connected to two other nodes.
7. Node 6: 3-star found with center at node 6 and leaves at nodes 0, 4, and 8. <6, (0, 4, 8)>
8. Node 7: Not a 3-star as it is connected to four other nodes.
9. Node 8: Not a 3-star as it is connected to three other nodes but is not the center of the 3-star.
10. Node 9: 3-star found with center at node 9 and leaves at nodes 3, 6, and 7. <9, (3, 6, 7)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3]. 
The unique 3-stars are <4, (0, 6, 9)>, <6, (0, 4, 8)>, and <9, (3, 6, 7)>.
