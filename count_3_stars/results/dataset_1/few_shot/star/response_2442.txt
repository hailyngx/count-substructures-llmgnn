Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars. 

Given the definition of a 3-star graph, we need to look for nodes that have exactly 3 edges connecting them to other nodes. From the adjacency list provided, we can list out the 3-stars:

<0, (2, 5, 6)>
<2, (0, 8, 9)>
<6, (0, 3, 9)>
<7, (3, 5, -)> (Note: The central node 7 is only connected to 2 other nodes, so the third node in this 3-star is missing and denoted by "-")

Now, counting the total number of 3-stars in this graph:
[3]
