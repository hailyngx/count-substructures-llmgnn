Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we look for nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them. These nodes represent the centers of the 3-stars in the graph. Counting the 3-stars involves identifying these central nodes and listing the nodes connected to them.

Based on the given information, we can see that nodes 0, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 have exactly three edges connected to them:
- Node 0: (0, 1), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7)
- Node 4: (4, 2), (4, 6), (4, 7)
- Node 5: (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 6)
- Node 6: (6, 0), (6, 4), (6, 5)
- Node 7: (7, 0), (7, 4), (7, 6)
- Node 8: (8, 2), (8, 5), (8, 7)

Now let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<4, (2, 6, 7)>
<5, (0, 1, 6)>
<6, (0, 4, 5)>
<7, (0, 4, 6)>
<8, (2, 5, 7)>

Count of 3-stars in the given graph: [6]
