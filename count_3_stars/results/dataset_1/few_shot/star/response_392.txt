Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 5, and node 8

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0: <0, (3, 4, 6)>
2. Node 1: <1, (3, 6, 7)>
3. Node 3: <3, (0, 1, 4)>
4. Node 4: <4, (0, 3, 5)>
5. Node 5: <5, (4, 8, 9)>
6. Node 8: <8, (5, 9, None)>
7. Node 9: <9, (5, 8, None)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
