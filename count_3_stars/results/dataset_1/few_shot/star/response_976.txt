Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 5, and node 7

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that form 3-stars. Since a 3-star graph consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can start by identifying all nodes that have exactly three edges.

Based on the provided adjacency list, the nodes with exactly three edges are:
- Node 1 (connected to nodes 6, 8, and center node 1)
- Node 5 (connected to nodes 8, 9, and center node 5)

Now, let's determine the 3-stars in the graph.

From the list above, the possible 3-stars are:
<1, (6, 8, 1)>
<5, (8, 9, 5)>

Counting the number of 3-stars we found gives us a total of [2]. 

Therefore, the answer is [2].
