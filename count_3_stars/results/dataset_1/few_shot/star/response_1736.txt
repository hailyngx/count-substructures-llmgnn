Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we can follow these steps:

1. For each node, identify if it is the center of a 3-star by checking if it has exactly three neighbors.

2. If a node is the center of a 3-star, list the three neighboring nodes in a tuple as the leaves of the 3-star.

Let's go through the adjacency list for each node:

Node 0: Not a 3-star center since it has 5 neighbors.
Node 1: Not a 3-star center since it has 0 neighbors.
Node 2: Not a 3-star center since it has 1 neighbor.
Node 3: A 3-star center with neighbors 4, 7, and 9. <3, (4, 7, 9)>
Node 4: Not a 3-star center since it has 3 neighbors.
Node 5: Not a 3-star center since it has 1 neighbor.
Node 6: Not a 3-star center since it has 2 neighbors.
Node 7: A 3-star center with neighbors 0, 3, and 9. <7, (0, 3, 9)>
Node 8: Not a 3-star center since it has 2 neighbors.
Node 9: Not a 3-star center since it has 3 neighbors.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is: [2]
Unique 3-stars found: <3, (4, 7, 9)>, <7, (0, 3, 9)>
