Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible 3-stars. 

Here is the list of unique 3-stars in the graph: 
<1, (0, 6, 9)>
<2, (3, 8, 9)>
<4, (7, 8, 9)>
<6, (1, 8, 9)>

Count of 3-stars in the graph: [4]
