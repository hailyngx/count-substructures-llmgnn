Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Based on the provided information, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<2, (4, 8, 9)>
<4, (2, 7, 8)>
<5, (1, 3, 6)>
<6, (5, 7, 9)>
<8, (2, 4, 9)>
<9, (2, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
