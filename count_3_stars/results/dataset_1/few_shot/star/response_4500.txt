Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 5

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph.

From the adjacency list, we can see that the nodes with degree 3 are nodes 0, 3, 4, and 5. These nodes can potentially be centers of 3-star graphs. Let's examine each possibility:

1. Node 0:
   <0, (1, 3, _)>  (Since Node 1 and Node 3 are reachable from Node 0)
   
2. Node 3:
   <3, (0, 1, 5)> and <3, (4, 9, _)>  (Since Node 0, 1, 5, 4, and 9 are reachable from Node 3)

3. Node 4:
   <4, (1, 2, 9)>  (Since Node 1, 2, and 9 are reachable from Node 4)

4. Node 5:
   <5, (3, 7, 9)>  (Since Node 3, 7, and 9 are reachable from Node 5)

Therefore, the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [4].
