Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 6
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes (forming a 3-star pattern). 

From the given adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<1, (0, 4, 9)>
<2, (0, 4, 6)>
<4, (1, 2, 7)>
<6, (2, 8, 9)>
<8, (5, 6,  )>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
