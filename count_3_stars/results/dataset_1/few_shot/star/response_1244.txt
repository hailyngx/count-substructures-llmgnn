Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the adjacency list and considering the definition of a 3-star graph, we can identify the following 3-stars:

<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<1, (0, 6, 8)>
<2, (0, 5, 7)>
<4, (0, 5, 7)>
<5, (2, 7, 8)>
<6, (1, 8, 9)>
<7, (3, 4, 5)>
<8, (5, 6, 1)>
<9, (6, 7, 9)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we have a total of [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
