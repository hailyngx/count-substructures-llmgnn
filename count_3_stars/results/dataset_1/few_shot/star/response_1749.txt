Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 8

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0 forms a 3-star: <0, (1, 2, 7)>
2. Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (0, 5, 6)>
3. Node 2 forms a 3-star: <2, (0, 3, 4)>
4. Node 3 forms a 3-star: <3, (2, 6, 9)>
5. Node 4 forms a 3-star: <4, (2, 6, 7)>
6. Node 5 forms a 3-star: <5, (1, 2, 8)>
7. Node 6 forms two 3-stars: <6, (1, 3, 4)> and <6, (7, 8, 1)>
8. Node 7 forms a 3-star: <7, (0, 4, 6)>
9. Node 8 forms a 3-star: <8, (5, 6, 9)>
10. Node 9 forms a 3-star: <9, (3, 8, 0)>

Therefore, there are [10] 3-stars in total.
