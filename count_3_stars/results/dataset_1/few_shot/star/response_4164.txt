Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, let's first identify the nodes that form 3-stars.

According to the definition, for a 3-star, the center node must have exactly 3 neighbors (leaves).

Here are the nodes that qualify as the center nodes:
- Nodes 0, 4, 5, 6, and 7 have 3 neighbors each.
- Nodes 3 and 9 have 2 neighbors each.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<0, (3, 7, 9)>
<4, (5, 6, 7)>
<5, (2, 4, 7)>
<6, (3, 4, 8)>
<7, (0, 2, 4)>
