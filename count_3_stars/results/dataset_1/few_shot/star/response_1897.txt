Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern. A 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Here are the unique 3-stars in the graph along with their center node and leaf nodes:
<1, (2, 3, 6)>
<2, (1, 3, 5)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<3, (1, 2, 6)>
<3, (1, 2, 9)>
<3, (2, 1, 5)>
<3, (2, 3, 5)>
<3, (3, 0, 9)>
<3, (3, 1, 2)>
<3, (3, 1, 6)>
<3, (3, 2, 5)>
<6, (0, 1, 7)>
<6, (0, 3, 5)>
<6, (0, 5, 7)>
<6, (1, 0, 3)>
<6, (1, 2, 5)>
<6, (1, 3, 0)>
<6, (1, 3, 5)>
<6, (1, 6, 7)>
<6, (2, 1, 5)>
<6, (2, 5, 1)>
<6, (3, 0, 1)>
<6, (3, 1, 0)>
<6, (3, 2, 5)>
<6, (3, 5, 9)>
<6, (5, 0, 7)>
<6, (5, 1, 2)>
<6, (5, 2, 1)>
<6, (5, 3, 9)>
<6, (5, 9, 3)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [31].
