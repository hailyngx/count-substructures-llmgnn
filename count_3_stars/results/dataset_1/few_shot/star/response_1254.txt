Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for instances where a node has exactly 3 neighbors. In this case, the central node of the 3-star will be the node with 3 neighbors, and the other 3 nodes connected to it will be the leaves of the 3-star.

From the adjacency list, we can see that nodes 0, 2, and 9 have 3 neighbors each. We can now list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<2, (0, 4, 6)>
<9, (1, 2, 3)>

Since there are 3 unique 3-stars in the given graph, the final answer is [3].
