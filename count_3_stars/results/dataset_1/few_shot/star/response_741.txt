Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 7, and node 8

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:

[<0, (3, 6, 7)>, <1, (3, 5, 7)>, <3, (0, 1, 2)>, <3, (0, 1, 6)>, <3, (0, 1, 7)>, <3, (0, 6, 8)>, <3, (1, 5, 7)>, <3, (1, 7, 8)>, <6, (0, 2, 3)>, <6, (0, 3, 8)>, <7, (0, 1, 3)>, <7, (0, 1, 5)>, <7, (0, 3, 8)>, <7, (1, 5, 7)>, <7, (1, 7, 8)>, <8, (3, 6, 7)>, <8, (3, 7, 9)>, <9, (0, 7, 8)>, <9, (1, 7, 8)>]
 
Since there are 19 unique 3-stars, the final answer is [19].
