Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to first identify all the 3-stars present in the graph. 

Let's use the definition of a 3-star graph (central node connected to exactly three other nodes) to find the 3-stars in the graph.

The 3-stars in the given graph are as follows:
<1, (2, 3, 8)>
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<2, (1, 3, 5)>
<2, (1, 3, 6)>
<2, (1, 5, 6)>
<2, (3, 5, 6)>
<2, (4, 7, 9)>
<3, (1, 2, 5)>
<3, (1, 2, 6)>
<3, (2, 5, 6)>
<4, (7, 8, 9)>
<5, (2, 3, 6)>
<7, (2, 4, 9)>
<8, (1, 4, 9)>
<9, (4, 7, 8)>

Count of 3-stars: [15]
