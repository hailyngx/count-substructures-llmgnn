Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 7, and node 8

Response:
Counting the number of 3-stars in the given graph:
First, let's identify all possible 3-stars in the graph based on the definition provided.

The possible 3-stars in this graph are:
<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<1, (0, 6, 8)>
<2, (7, 8, 3)>
<4, (0, 7, -)>
<7, (2, 4, 8)>
<8, (1, 2, 9)>
<9, (7, 8, -)>

Counting the number of 3-stars:
