Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 9
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 5

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are as follows:

<0, (2, 8, 9)>
<2, (0, 1, 7)>
<4, (1, 5, 8)>
<5, (1, 2, 9)>
<7, (0, 2, 8)>
