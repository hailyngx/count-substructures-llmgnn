Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node and the three nodes connected to it.

Looking at the adjacency lists, we can see that the possible central nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes are nodes 1, 3, 4, and 8.

Let's list the unique 3-stars:
<1, (0, 8, 9)>
<3, (0, 4, 8)>
<4, (3, 7, 9)>
<8, (1, 3, 9)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars: [4]
