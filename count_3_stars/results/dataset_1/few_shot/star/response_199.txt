Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 4
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, and node 6

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0: <0, (3, 7, 9)>
- Node 1: <1, (4, 7, 9)>
- Node 2: <2, (5, 6, 7)> and <2, (6, 7, 9)>
- Node 3: <3, (0, 7, 9)>
- Node 4: <4, (1, 7, 9)>
- Node 6: <6, (2, 7, 9)>
- Node 7: <7, (0, 1, 4)> and <7, (0, 2, 4)> and <7, (1, 2, 4)>
- Node 9: <9, (0, 1, 3)> and <9, (0, 1, 6)> and <9, (0, 2, 3)> and <9, (0, 2, 6)> and <9, (1, 2, 3)> and <9, (1, 2, 6)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
