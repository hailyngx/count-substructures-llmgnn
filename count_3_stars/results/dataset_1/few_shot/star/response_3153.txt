Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 8

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph:

1. <0, (2, 8, 9)>
2. <1, (2, 4, 6)>
3. <2, (0, 1, 6)>
4. <4, (1, 5, 6)>
5. <8, (0, 4, 9)>

Therefore, there are a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
