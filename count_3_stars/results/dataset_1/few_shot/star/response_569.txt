Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 9) (6, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 5

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- Node 0 forms a 3-star: <0, (6, 9)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star: <2, (3, 9)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star: <3, (2, 8, 9)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star: <9, (0, 2, 3)>
- There are no other 3-stars in this graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
