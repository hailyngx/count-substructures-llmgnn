Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 7
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star-like structure.

Based on the given information, the 3-stars in the graph are as follows:

<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<1, (0, 5, 7)>
<4, (0, 5, 7)>
<5, (0, 1, 4)>
<7, (1, 4, 8)>
<8, (0, 7, 9)>
<9, (7, 8)>
 
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
