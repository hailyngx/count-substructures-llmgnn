Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 5, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first identify the 3-stars based on the definition provided.

A 3-star is formed by a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's find the 3-stars in the graph by looking at each node and checking if it forms a 3-star structure around it.

The graph contains the following 3-stars:
<1, (2, 3, 4)>
<3, (1, 2, 6)>
<5, (8, 9, -)>
<6, (0, 3, 8)>
<8, (5, 6, 9)>

Now we count the number of unique 3-stars: [5].
