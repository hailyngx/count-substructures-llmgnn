Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 6

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0: {(0, 4, 8), (0, 4, 9)}
2. Node 1: (1, 4, 5)
3. Node 3: (3, 6, 8), (3, 6, 9)
4. Node 4: (4, 0, 1), (4, 0, 2), (4, 0, 7), (4, 1, 2), (4, 1, 7), (4, 2, 7), (4, 6, 7)
5. Node 5: (5, 1, 6), (5, 1, 8), (5, 1, 9)
6. Node 6: (6, 3, 8), (6, 3, 9), (6, 4, 5), (6, 4, 8), (6, 4, 9), (6, 5, 8), (6, 5, 9)
7. Node 8: (8, 0, 3), (8, 0, 5), (8, 0, 6), (8, 3, 5), (8, 3, 6), (8, 5, 6)
8. Node 9: (9, 0, 3), (9, 0, 5), (9, 0, 6), (9, 3, 5), (9, 3, 6), (9, 5, 6)

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph is: [18]
Unique 3-stars: <0, (4, 8, 9)>, <1, (4, 5, 0)>, <1, (4, 5, 6)>, <3, (6, 8, 9)>, <4, (7, 1, 2)>, <4, (7, 2, 0)>, <4, (7, 6, 0)>, <5, (6, 1, 8)>, <5, (6, 1, 9)>, <8, (6, 0, 5)>, <8, (6, 5, 3)>, <9, (6, 5, 3)>, <9, (6, 0, 3)>
