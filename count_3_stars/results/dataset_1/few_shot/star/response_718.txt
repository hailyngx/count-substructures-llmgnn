Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for each possible 3-star centered at each node. 
Let's start by listing the 3-stars for each node:

<0, (6, 9)>
<1, (2, 9)>
<2, (1, 4, 8)>
<3, (2, 5, 6)>
<4, (2, 5, 9)>
<5, (3, 4)>
<6, (0, 2, 7)>
<7, (3, 6)>
<8, (2, 6, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 4)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars:
[10]
