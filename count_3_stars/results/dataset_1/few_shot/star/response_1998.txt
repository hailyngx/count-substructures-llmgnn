Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 7

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph can be identified by finding nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 
Let's list them out. 

<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<0, (1, 6, 9)>

<1, (0, 3, 7)>
<1, (0, 7, 9)>

<2, (0, 4, 5)>
<2, (4, 5, 6)>

<3, (1, 4, 8)>
<3, (4, 6, 0)>

<4, (0, 2, 3)>
<4, (0, 3, 6)>
<4, (2, 3, 6)>

<5, (2, 6, 9)>
<5, (6, 9, 0)>

<6, (0, 4, 5)>
<6, (0, 5, 9)>
<6, (4, 5, 9)>

<7, (1, 8, 9)>
<7, (8, 9, 0)>
<7, (9, 0, 1)>

<8, (3, 1, 7)>
<8, (1, 7, 9)>

<9, (0, 5, 7)>
<9, (5, 7, 1)>
<9, (7, 1, 0)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [24].
