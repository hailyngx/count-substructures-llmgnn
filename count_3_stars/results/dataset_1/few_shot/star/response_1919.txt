Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can identify each 3-star pattern where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Based on the adjacency list, we can see that the possible central nodes for the 3-stars are nodes 0, 2, 3, and 8. 

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (2, 8, 1)>
<2, (0, 7, 9)>
<3, (5, 6, 8)>
<8, (0, 2, 3)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars in the graph gives us a total of [4].
