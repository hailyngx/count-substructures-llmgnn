Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in the form of a star. 

Based on the given adjacency list and the definition of a 3-star graph, we can identify the unique 3-stars in the graph. Let's list them:

<1, (3, 6, 7)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<3, (1, 2, 5)>
<3, (4, 5, 9)>
<6, (1, 5, 9)>
<8, (4, 6, 9)>
<9, (3, 5, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
