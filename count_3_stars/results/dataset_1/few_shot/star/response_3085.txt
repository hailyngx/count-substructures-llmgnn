Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 7, and node 8

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph:

1. Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 5: <0, (3, 5)>
2. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 7: <1, (3, 7)>
3. Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 5, 8: <2, (4, 5, 8)>
4. Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, 8: <3, (0, 1, 8)>
5. Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 2, 6: <5, (0, 2, 6)>
6. Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 3, 9: <8, (2, 3, 9)>
7. Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 8: <9, (7, 8)>

Total number of 3-star graphs: [6]
