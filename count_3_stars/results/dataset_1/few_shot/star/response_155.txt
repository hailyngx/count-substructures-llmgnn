Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we first need to identify all possible 3-stars with the given information about the graph. 

Given the definition of a 3-star graph, each 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Now, let's list out all the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (2, 8, 9)>
<1, (2, 3, 5)>
<2, (0, 1, 4)>
<2, (0, 4, 9)>
<2, (1, 4, 9)>
<3, (1, 5, 6)>
<3, (1, 5, 7)>
<3, (2, 4, 9)>
<5, (3, 6, 7)>
<5, (6, 7, 3)>
<6, (5, 7, 3)>
<7, (5, 6, 3)>

By counting the total number of unique 3-stars listed above, we find that there are [12] 3-stars in the given graph.
