Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 5, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's identify the 3-stars first. 

From the given information, let's list the 3-stars present in the graph:
1. <0, (1, 2, 7)>
2. <2, (0, 6, 9)>
3. <9, (2, 5, 7)>.

Therefore, we have found 3 unique 3-stars in the graph. 
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
