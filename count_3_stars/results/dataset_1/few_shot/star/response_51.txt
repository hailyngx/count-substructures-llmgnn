Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 5

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are part of a 3-star graph. We are looking for nodes with exactly three neighbors. 

1. Node 2 has 2 neighbors.
2. Node 3 has 1 neighbor.
3. Node 4 has 2 neighbors.
4. Node 7 has 1 neighbor.
5. Node 6 has 2 neighbors.

Therefore, the nodes that can be centers of 3-stars are nodes 0, 1, 5, 8, and 9. Let's check each of these nodes if they form 3-stars.

For Node 0:
- (0, 1, 5)
- (0, 1, 6)
- (0, 1, 8)
- (0, 1, 9)
- (0, 5, 6)
- (0, 5, 8)
- (0, 5, 9)
- (0, 6, 8)
- (0, 6, 9)
- (0, 8, 9)

For Node 1:
- (1, 0, 5)
- (1, 0, 8)
- (1, 0, 9)
- (1, 5, 8)
- (1, 5, 9)
- (1, 8, 9)

For Node 5:
- (5, 0, 1)
- (5, 0, 8)
- (5, 0, 9)
- (5, 1, 8)
- (5, 1, 9)
- (5, 8, 9)

For Node 8:
- (8, 0, 1)
- (8, 0, 5)
- (8, 0, 6)
- (8, 1, 5)
- (8, 1, 6)
- (8, 5, 6)

For Node 9:
- (9, 0, 1)
- (9, 0, 5)
- (9, 1, 5)

Therefore, the 3-stars found are: 
<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<0, (1, 5, 9)>
<0, (5, 8, 9)>
<1, (0, 5, 8)>
<1, (0, 5, 9)>
<1, (5, 8, 9)>
<5, (0, 1, 8)>
<5, (0, 1, 9)>
<5, (1, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 1, 5)>
<8, (0, 1, 6)>
<8, (1, 5, 6)>
<9, (0, 1, 5)>
<9, (0, 1, 8)>
<9, (1, 5, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [15].
