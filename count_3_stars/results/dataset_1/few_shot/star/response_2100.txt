Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify nodes that can act as the center of a 3-star. In this case, any node that has exactly three neighbors can be a center of a 3-star.

Nodes that can be the center of a 3-star:
- Node 0 (neighbors: 1, 6)
- Node 1 (neighbors: 0, 9)
- Node 4 (neighbors: 2, 3, 7)
- Node 5 (neighbors: 3, 7)
- Node 9 (neighbors: 1, 3, 4)

Now, let's count the unique 3-stars in this graph:
- <0, (1, 6)>
- <1, (0, 9)>
- <4, (2, 3, 7)>
- <5, (3, 7)>
- <9, (1, 3, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
