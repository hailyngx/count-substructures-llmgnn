Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star configuration.

Starting with the given information:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 6
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 4 and 7
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1 and 6
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 5, 7, and 8
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 4, 7, and 8
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 7
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 5, 6, and 9
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 4 and 5
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0 and 7

By examining the connections, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<1, (4, 5, 6)>
<4, (1, 2, 8)>
<7, (2, 5, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
