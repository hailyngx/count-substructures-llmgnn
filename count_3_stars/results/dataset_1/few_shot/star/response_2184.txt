Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Based on the provided adjacency list and edge information, the 3-stars in the graph are as follows:
<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<1, (0, 2, 5)>
<1, (2, 5, 6)>
<2, (1, 3, 9)>
<3, (0, 2, 5)>
<3, (2, 5, 7)>
<4, (7, 8, 9)>
<5, (1, 3, 7)>
<7, (3, 4, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
