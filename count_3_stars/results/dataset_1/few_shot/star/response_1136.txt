Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the edge list, we see that the key pattern to identify 3-stars is when a node is connected to three other nodes. Let's find all such instances:

1. <1, (6, 8, 9)>
2. <2, (4, 6, 7)>
3. <3, (7, 9,  )>
4. <4, (2, 7,  )>
5. <6, (1, 2, 7)>
6. <7, (0, 2, 3)>
7. <8, (1, 2, 9)>
8. <9, (1, 3, 8)>

From the list above, we've identified all unique 3-stars in the graph. Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars.
