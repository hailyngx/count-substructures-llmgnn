Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars, we need to identify all possible configurations where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's analyze the graph and find the 3-stars:
1. Node 0: (0, 1), (0, 8) - No 3-star
2. Node 1: (1, 0), (1, 3), (1, 5) - <1, (0, 3, 5)>
3. Node 2: (2, 6), (2, 7) - No 3-star
4. Node 3: (3, 1), (3, 5), (3, 8) - <3, (1, 5, 8)>
5. Node 4: Not connected to any other nodes
6. Node 5: (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 7) - <5, (1, 3, 7)>
7. Node 6: (6, 2) - No 3-star
8. Node 7: (7, 2), (7, 5) - No 3-star
9. Node 8: (8, 0), (8, 3) - No 3-star
10. Node 9: Not connected to any other nodes

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2] and the unique 3-stars are <1, (0, 3, 5)> and <3, (1, 5, 8)>.
