Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 8

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

From the given information, we can see that the nodes connected to each node. We need to find nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. We can list the 3-stars by checking each node and its connections.

Here are the 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<0, (1, 4, 7)>
<1, (0, 3, 7)>
<2, (0, 4, 7)>
<2, (0, 4, 9)>
<2, (4, 7, 9)>
<4, (0, 2, 5)>
<7, (0, 1, 9)>
<7, (1, 2, 9)>
<7, (2, 9, 8)>
<9, (2, 7, 8)>
