Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star pattern. 

Looking at the provided information, we can identify the 3-stars as follows:

<0, (1, 2, 7)>
<2, (0, 3, 7)>
<7, (2, 9, 0)>
<3, (2, 8, -)>
<9, (4, 7, -)>

Thus, there are a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
