Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are as follows:
[<0, (1, 2, 3)>, <2, (0, 3, 4)>, <4, (2, 6, 7)>, <7, (0, 2, 4)>, <8, (4, 7, 0)>]
