Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 7

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's start by listing all the 3-stars in the graph:

<1, (2, 7, 9)>
<2, (1, 6, 7)>

Now, we can count the total number of 3-stars: [2].
