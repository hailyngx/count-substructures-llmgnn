Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 5, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the nodes that form 3-star configurations. In a 3-star, the center node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

By examining the adjacency list, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (5, 7, 9)>
<1, (7, 8, 9)>
<2, (3, 5, 8)>
<3, (2, 4, 6)>
<4, (3, 6, 9)>
<5, (0, 2, 8)>
<6, (3, 4, 8)>
<7, (0, 1, 9)>
<8, (1, 2, 6)>
<9, (0, 1, 4)>

Counting the unique 3-stars found in the graph, we get a total of [10] 3-stars.
