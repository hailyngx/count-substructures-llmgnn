Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 4, 7, and node 8

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph.
Here are the 3-stars in the given graph:
<1, (2, 5, 6)>
<2, (1, 5, 9)>
<4, (5, 6, 7)>
<5, (1, 2, 4)>
<7, (3, 4, 9)>
<9, (2, 4, 7)>
