Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star pattern, which consists of a central node and 3 other connected nodes. Let's go through each node and its neighbors to find all 3-stars.

1. Node 0:
   - <0, (1, 4, 6)>
   - <0, (1, 6, 8)>
   [2]

2. Node 1:
   - <1, (0, 4, 6)>
   - <1, (0, 6, 8)>
   - <1, (2, 6, 8)>
   [3]

3. Node 2:
   - <2, (1, 6, 8)>
   [1]

4. Node 3:
   - No 3-stars found.

5. Node 4:
   - <4, (0, 1, 6)>
   [1]

6. Node 5:
   - No 3-stars found.

7. Node 6:
   - <6, (0, 1, 2)>
   - <6, (0, 1, 4)>
   - <6, (1, 2, 8)>
   - <6, (1, 3, 7)>
   [4]

8. Node 7:
   - No 3-stars found.

9. Node 8:
   - <8, (0, 1, 2)>
   - <8, (0, 1, 9)>
   - <8, (1, 2, 9)>
   [3]

10. Node 9:
   - No 3-stars found.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [13].
