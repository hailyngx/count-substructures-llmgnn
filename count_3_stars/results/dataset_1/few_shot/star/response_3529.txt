Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0

Response:
There are two 3-stars in the given graph.
The unique 3-stars are <1, (2, 4, 6)> and <3, (0, 1, 6)>.

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
