Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a 3-star pattern. 

Let's analyze the graph to find all 3-stars:
1. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 5, and 7. (1, (0, 5, 7))
2. Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 7. (3, (4, 5, 7))
3. Node 3 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 9. (3, (5, 6, 9))
4. Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 4. (5, (1, 2, 4))
5. Node 6 is connected to nodes 3, 7, 9. (6, (3, 7, 9))

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].

Here are the unique 3-stars found:
<1, (0, 5, 7)>
<3, (4, 5, 7)>
<3, (5, 6, 9)>
<5, (1, 2, 4)>
<6, (3, 7, 9)>
