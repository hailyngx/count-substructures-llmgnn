Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 5
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star-like formation.

Looking at the adjacency list, we can identify the pairs of nodes that form 3-star configurations. Let's list them:
<0, (1, 7)>
<1, (0, 2, 7)>
<2, (1, 3, 5)>
<3, (2, 4)>
<4, (3, 7, 9)>
<5, (2, 7)>
<6, (9)>
<9, (1, 2, 4)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we get a total of [8].
