Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step by step:

Node 0: Not part of any 3-star
Node 1: Not part of any 3-star
Node 2: Not part of any 3-star
Node 3: Not part of any 3-star
Node 4: <4, (5, 7, 8)>
Node 5: Not part of any 3-star
Node 6: <6, (0, 1, 9)>
Node 7: Not part of any 3-star
Node 8: Not part of any 3-star
Node 9: Not part of any 3-star

Count of 3-stars: [2]
