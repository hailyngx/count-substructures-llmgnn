Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to understand the concept of a 3-star graph and then identify the 3-stars based on the provided information.

In a 3-star graph, each 3-star consists of one central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Given the adjacency list and edge information, we will identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Identify the central nodes:
   - Central nodes are nodes with degree 3 (connected to exactly 3 other nodes).
   - From the adjacency list, nodes 1, 3, 4, 6, and 9 are central nodes.

2. For each central node, identify the connected nodes to form the 3-stars:
   - For Node 1: (1, 0, 8, 9), (1, 4, 6, 9)
   - For Node 3: (3, 4, 6, 9)
   - For Node 4: (4, 1, 3, 9)
   - For Node 6: (6, 1, 3, 9)
   - For Node 9: (9, 1, 3, 4), (9, 2, 5, 6)

In total, we have the following 3-stars in the graph:
<1, (0, 8, 9)>, <1, (4, 6, 9)>, <3, (4, 6, 9)>, <4, (1, 3, 9)>, <6, (1, 3, 9)>, <9, (1, 3, 4)>, <9, (2, 5, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
