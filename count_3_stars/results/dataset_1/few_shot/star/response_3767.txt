Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 5
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 5
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star configuration.

Let's analyze each node to find 3-stars:
- Node 0: Forms 3-stars with nodes 1, 2, 3, and 5.
- Node 1: Forms 3-star with nodes 0, 2, and 3.
- Node 2: Forms 3-star with nodes 0, 1, and 3.
- Node 3: Forms 3-star with nodes 0, 1, and 2.
- Node 4: Not connected to any other nodes, so no 3-star.
- Node 5: Forms 3-stars with nodes 0, 3, 7, and 8.
- Node 6: Not connected to any other nodes, so no 3-star.
- Node 7: Forms 3-star with nodes 1, 5, and 6.
- Node 8: Forms 3-stars with nodes 0, 2, and 5.
- Node 9: Not connected to any other nodes, so no 3-star.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<0, (2, 3, 5)>
<5, (0, 3, 7)>
<5, (0, 7, 8)>

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
