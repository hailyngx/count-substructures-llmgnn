Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 6
