Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for nodes that have exactly 3 neighbors. These nodes will be the centers of the 3-stars. We then check each neighbor of the center to see if they are connected to each other, forming a valid 3-star.

Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

**Node 0: (4, 5, 8)**
- <0, (4, 5, 8)>

**Node 1: (2, 4, 6)**
- <1, (2, 4, 6)>

**Node 2: (1, 6, 8)**
- <2, (1, 6, 8)>

**Node 3: No 3-star**

**Node 4: (0, 1, 7)**
- <4, (0, 1, 7)>

**Node 5: No 3-star**

**Node 6: (1, 2, 8)**
- <6, (1, 2, 8)>

**Node 7: (2, 4, 9), (4, 5, 7)**
- <7, (2, 4, 9)>
- <7, (4, 5, 7)>

**Node 8: (0, 2, 6)**
- <8, (0, 2, 6)>

**Node 9: No 3-star**

Total number of 3-stars: [7]
