Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique configurations where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's analyze the graph information provided to find the 3-stars.

Given edges:
(2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9)
(6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7)

Let's identify the 3-stars:

<2, (8, 9, 3)>
<3, (5, 6, 8)>
<5, (3, 4, 9)>
<6, (3, 4, 7)>
<7, (6, 9, 3)>
<8, (2, 3, 9)>
<9, (2, 5, 7)>

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
