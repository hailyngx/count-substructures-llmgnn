Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 4

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].

The 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 4, 8)>
<0, (2, 4, 9)>
<0, (2, 7, 8)>
<0, (2, 7, 9)>
<2, (4, 5, 6)>
<2, (4, 6, 9)>
<2, (5, 6, 9)>
