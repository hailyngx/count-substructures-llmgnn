Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible 3-stars.

Looking at the adjacency list, we can see that nodes 0, 1, 4, 5, and 8 are the only nodes connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars involving these central nodes:

- For node 0: <0, (4, 8, 6)> and <0, (8, 4, 9)>
- For node 1: <1, (5, 9, 7)>
- For node 4: <4, (0, 9, 8)>
- For node 5: <5, (1, 7, 9)>
- For node 8: <8, (0, 9, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
