Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 7

Response:
Given the information provided, we will identify the 3-stars in the graph.

We can see that each 3-star is uniquely defined by its central node and the three nodes connected to it. 

Let's identify the 3-stars:
<2, (0, 6, 4)>
<6, (2, 4, 5)>
<1, (3, 4, 5)>
<4, (1, 6, 8)>
<5, (1, 6, 9)>
<8, (4, 6, 7)>
<9, (5, 6, 7)>

Therefore, there are a total of [7] 3-stars in the given graph.
