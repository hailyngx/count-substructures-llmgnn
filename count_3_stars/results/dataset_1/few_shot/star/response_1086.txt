Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 8

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern. 

Let's examine each node to see if it forms the center of a 3-star:
- Node 0: <0, (2, 6, _)>  (2, 6, _ can be 1, 3, 9)
- Node 1: No 3-star pattern as it is only connected to one other node.
- Node 2: <2, (0, 1, _)>, <2, (3, 6, _)>, <2, (8, _, _)>
- Node 3: <3, (2, 6, _)>, <3, (7, 8, _)>, <3, (6, 9, _)>
- Node 4: No 3-star pattern as it is only connected to two other nodes.
- Node 5: No 3-star pattern as it is only connected to one other node.
- Node 6: <6, (0, 2, _)>, <6, (3, 7, _)>, <6, (9, _, _)>
- Node 7: <7, (3, 4, _)>, <7, (5, 6, _)>
- Node 8: <8, (2, 3, _)>, <8, (4, 9, _)>
- Node 9: No 3-star pattern as it is only connected to two other nodes.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].

Unique 3-stars: <0, (2, 6, _)>, <2, (0, 1, _)>, <2, (3, 6, _)>, <2, (8, _, _)>, <3, (2, 6, _)>, <3, (7, 8, _)>, <3, (6, 9, _)>, <6, (0, 2, _)>, <6, (3, 7, _)>, <6, (9, _, _)>, <7, (3, 4, _)>, <7, (5, 6, _)>
