Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 7

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- For node 0: (0, 4, 6), (0, 7, 9)  [<0, (4, 6, 0)>, <0, (7, 9, 0)>]
- For node 1: No 3-star
- For node 2: (2, 1, 3), (2, 3, 7) [<2, (1, 3, 7)>]
- For node 3: (3, 1, 2), (3, 2, 9) [<3, (1, 2, 9)>]
- For node 4: No 3-star
- For node 5: No 3-star
- For node 6: No 3-star
- For node 7: (7, 0, 9) [<7, (0, 9, 7)>]
- For node 8: No 3-star
- For node 9: (9, 0, 7), (9, 3, 2)  [<9, (0, 7, 9)>, <9, (3, 2, 9)>]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 5.
