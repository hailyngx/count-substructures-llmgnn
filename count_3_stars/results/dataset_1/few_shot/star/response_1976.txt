Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the possible 3-stars based on the definition given. As a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can first look at each node and see if it forms a 3-star. 

Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
1. Node 0: (0, 3, 8), (0, 3, 9) [2]
2. Node 1: (1, 3, 5), (1, 5, 6) [2]
3. Node 2: (2, 3, 9) [1]
4. Node 3: (3, 0, 1), (3, 0, 2), (3, 1, 5) [3]
5. Node 4: No 3-stars
6. Node 5: (5, 1, 3), (5, 1, 6), (5, 1, 8), (5, 1, 7), (5, 4, 7) [5]
7. Node 6: (6, 1, 5) [1]
8. Node 7: No 3-stars
9. Node 8: (8, 0, 5), (8, 0, 6), (8, 0, 9), (8, 5, 1), (8, 5, 6), (8, 5, 9) [6]
10. Node 9: (9, 0, 3), (9, 0, 8), (9, 2, 3), (9, 7, 5), (9, 8, 0), (9, 8, 5) [6]

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph is [17]. 

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<0, (3, 8, 9)>
<1, (3, 5, 6)>
<2, (3, 9)>
<3, (0, 1, 5)>
<5, (1, 4, 7)>
<6, (1, 5, 8)>
<8, (0, 5, 6)>
<8, (0, 5, 9)>
<8, (5, 1, 6)>
<8, (5, 1, 9)>
<8, (0, 6, 9)>
<9, (0, 8, 5)>
<9, (2, 3, 9)>
<9, (7, 5, 1)>
<9, (0, 8, 5)>
<9, (8, 5, 0)>
<9, (8, 5, 1)>
