Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 3

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the unique instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list the 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (1, 2, 8)>
<1, (0, 4, 5)>
<2, (0, 7, 9)>
<4, (1, 5, 6)>
<5, (1, 4, 8)>
<8, (0, 3, 5)>
<9, (2, 3)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we have a total of [7].
