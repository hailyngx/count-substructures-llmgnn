Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 6

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible 3-stars in the graph based on the connectivity of nodes. 

Looking at the adjacency list for each node, we can determine the following unique 3-stars: 
<0, (7, 8, 1)>
<1, (6, 7, 8)>
<1, (6, 7, 9)>
<1, (6, 8, 9)>
<2, (4, 7, 1)>
<4, (2, 7, 1)>
<5, (6, 9, 1)>
<6, (1, 5, 9)>
<6, (1, 9, 7)>
<7, (0, 1, 2)>
<7, (0, 2, 1)>
<8, (0, 1, 6)>
<9, (1, 5, 6)>
<9, (1, 6, 7)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars found gives us a total of [13].
