Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 2

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the 3-stars. 

Let's start by listing the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 7, 8
- Node 1: 3, 4, 7
- Node 2: 4, 9
- Node 3: 1, 8
- Node 4: 1, 2, 6
- Node 5: 7
- Node 6: 4, 7, 8
- Node 7: 0, 1, 5, 6
- Node 8: 0, 3, 6
- Node 9: 2

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- <0, (7, 8, 1)>
- <1, (3, 4, 7)>
- <4, (1, 2, 6)>
- <7, (0, 1, 5)>
- <6, (4, 7, 8)>

So, there are [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
