Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will form the centers of 3-stars. 

From the adjacency list and the edges provided, we can identify the following 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (2, 3, 6)>
<0, (2, 6, 7)>
<0, (3, 6, 7)>
<2, (0, 1, 4)>
<2, (0, 8, 9)>
<2, (1, 4, 8)>
<2, (1, 8, 9)>
<2, (4, 8, 9)>
<6, (0, 1, 9)>
<8, (2, 4, 5)>

Counting the unique 3-stars found, we get [9].
