Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly 3 other nodes. These nodes will act as the central nodes of the 3-stars. Based on the provided adjacency list, the potential central nodes are: 3, 4, 7, and 8.

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Central Node: 3
   Leaves: 2, 7, 8

2. Central Node: 4
   Leaves: 0, 5, 8

3. Central Node: 7
   Leaves: 3, 8, 9

4. Central Node: 8
   Leaves: 2, 4, 9

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].

<3, (2, 7, 8)>, <4, (0, 5, 8)>, <7, (3, 8, 9)>, <8, (2, 4, 9)>
