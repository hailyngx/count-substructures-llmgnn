Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6

Response:
Based on the information provided, we can identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars in the graph are:
<0, (6, 7, 8)>
<1, (5, 7, 8)>

Counting the number of 3-stars in the graph, we get a total of [2].
