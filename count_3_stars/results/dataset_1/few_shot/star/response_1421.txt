Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Looking at the given graph, we can list the unique 3-stars as follows:
<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<2, (4, 5, 8)>
<4, (2, 3, 9)>
<5, (0, 2, 9)>

Now, counting the total number of 3-stars in the graph: 
[4]
