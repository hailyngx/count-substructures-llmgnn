Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we can see that the possible 3-star configurations will involve nodes with exactly three connections. Let's list the unique 3-stars present in the graph:

<2, (6, 8, 4)>
<4, (6, 8, 9)>
<5, (6, 7, 9)>
<6, (0, 2, 4)>
<6, (2, 4, 8)>
<6, (4, 5, 9)>
<7, (4, 5, 9)>
<8, (2, 4, 6)>
<9, (4, 5, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
