Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 44 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star configuration.

Let's start by listing all the 3-star configurations:
1. <0, (1, 5, 6)>
2. <1, (0, 6, 7)>
3. <2, (0, 6, 8)>
4. <3, (1, 5, -)>
5. <4, (1, 6, -)>
6. <5, (0, 3, 9)>
7. <6, (0, 1, 2)>
8. <7, (0, 1, 6)>
9. <8, (1, 2, 8)>
10. <9, (1, 5, 8)>

Since all unique 3-star configurations have been listed above, we can count and output the final answer:
