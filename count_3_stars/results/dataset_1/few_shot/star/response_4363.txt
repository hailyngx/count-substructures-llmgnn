Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 4, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

From the given graph, we can identify the following 3-star structures:

<1, (4, 6, 9)>
<2, (3, 8, 9)>
<3, (2, 4, 8)>
<4, (1, 3, 6)>
<6, (0, 1, 4)>
<7, (1, 5, 9)>
<8, (2, 3, 6)>
<9, (0, 1, 7)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8]. 

<1, (4, 6, 9)> <2, (3, 8, 9)> <3, (2, 4, 8)> <4, (1, 3, 6)> <6, (0, 1, 4)> <7, (1, 5, 9)> <8, (2, 3, 6)> <9, (0, 1, 7)>
