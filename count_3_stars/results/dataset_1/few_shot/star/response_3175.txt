Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to understand how a 3-star is formed. In a 3-star graph, the center node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Based on the adjacency list provided, we can identify that the nodes with exactly 3 adjacent nodes are nodes 0, 3, 7, and 2 (as they are connected to exactly 3 other nodes).

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (1, 5, 9)>
<2, (4, 9, 1)>
<3, (1, 5, 0)>
<7, (1, 8, 9)>

There are a total of [4] 3-stars in the given graph.
