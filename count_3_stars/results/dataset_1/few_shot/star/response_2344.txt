Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 7

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. From the adjacency list, we can see that Node 0 forms a 3-star with (4, 6, 9):
   <0, (4, 6, 9)>

2. Similarly, we can find that Node 1 also forms a 3-star: 
   <1, (2, 3, 5)>

3. Node 2 forms a 3-star with (1, 6, 9):
   <2, (1, 6, 9)>

4. Node 5 forms a 3-star with (1, 6, 7):
   <5, (1, 6, 7)>

5. Node 9 forms a 3-star with (0, 2, 7):
   <9, (0, 2, 7)>

Therefore, there are a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
