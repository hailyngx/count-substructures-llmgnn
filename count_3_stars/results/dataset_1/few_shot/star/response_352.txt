Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 3

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's analyze the graph:

1. Nodes with 3 connections:
   - Node 0 is connected to nodes 2 and 7. (0, 2, 7)
   - Node 8 is connected to node 3. (8, 3, 9)
  
2. Nodes with more or fewer than 3 connections:
   - Nodes 1, 4, 6, and 9 have 4 connections each.
   - Nodes 2 and 5 have 3 connections each but not in the required form of a 3-star.

Based on the analysis, there are two 3-stars in the given graph: <0, (2, 7, 8)> and <8, (3, 9, 0)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
