Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 4, and node 6

Response:
Since a 3-star graph has a center node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can identify the 3-stars in the given graph by looking for nodes connected to three other nodes.

The possible 3-stars in this graph are:
<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<1, (0, 4, 6)>
<4, (1, 3, 5)>
<9, (0, 3, 6)>

Therefore, there are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.
