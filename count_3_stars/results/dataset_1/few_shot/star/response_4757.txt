Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star and count them. 

Let's list out the 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<0, (2, 3, 5)>
<0, (2, 5, 6)>
<0, (2, 7, 9)>
<1, (7, 8, 9)>
<2, (0, 3, 6)>
<2, (0, 6, 8)>
<3, (0, 2, 6)>
<4, (0, 6, 5)>
<5, (0, 6, 7)>
<6, (2, 4, 5)>
<6, (2, 5, 7)>
<6, (2, 7, 9)>
<7, (0, 5, 6)>
<7, (1, 9, 8)>
<8, (1, 9, 7)>
<9, (6, 7, 8)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars in the graph gives us the answer: [16].
