Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (2, 5) (3, 8) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of nodes where one node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's find the 3-stars:

<5, (1, 2, 4)>
<8, (3, 5, 9)>
