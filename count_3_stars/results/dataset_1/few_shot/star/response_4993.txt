Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

From the adjacency list, the nodes that have exactly 3 edges are:
- Node 1: Connected to nodes 0, 2, and 8
- Node 4: Connected to nodes 3, 5, and 6

Let's list the unique 3-stars found:

<1, (0, 2, 8)>
<4, (3, 5, 6)>

Therefore, there are [2] 3-stars in the given graph.
