Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star configuration. 

Let's first list all the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (2, 7)>
<1, (5, 9)>
<2, (0, 3)>
<3, (2, 8)>
<5, (1, 6, 9)>
<6, (5, 7, 9)>
<7, (0, 6)>
<8, (3)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph: 
[8]
