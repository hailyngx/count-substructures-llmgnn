Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Here are the 3-stars found in the given graph:

<0, (2, 3, 6)>
<0, (2, 3, 8)>
<0, (2, 6, 8)>
<0, (3, 6, 9)>
<2, (0, 3, 8)>
<3, (0, 2, 9)>
<6, (0, 1, 4)>
<6, (0, 1, 5)>
<6, (0, 4, 5)>
<9, (0, 3, 8)>

So, there are [10] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
