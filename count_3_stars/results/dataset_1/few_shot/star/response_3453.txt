Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star configuration.

Based on the information provided, we can see that the possible 3-star configurations involving node 0 are:

1. <0, (3, 5, 9)>
2. <0, (3, 5)>
3. <0, (3, 9)>
Since node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 9.

Next, let's consider the other nodes:
- There are no 3-star configurations involving node 1.
- The possible 3-star configuration involving node 2 is <2, (1, 3, 5)>.
- The possible 3-star configurations involving node 3 are <3, (0, 2, 6)>, <3, (0, 7, 9)>, and <3, (2, 6, 9)>.
- There are no 3-star configurations involving node 4.
- There are no 3-star configurations involving node 5.
- There are no 3-star configurations involving node 6.
- There are no 3-star configurations involving node 7.
- There are no 3-star configurations involving node 8.
- There are no 3-star configurations involving node 9.

Counting all the unique 3-stars found, we have a total of [7] 3-stars in the given graph. 

Therefore, the answer is [7].

Unique 3-stars: 
<0, (3, 5, 9)>
<0, (3, 5)>
<0, (3, 9)>
<2, (1, 3, 5)>
<3, (0, 2, 6)>
<3, (0, 7, 9)>
<3, (2, 6, 9)>
