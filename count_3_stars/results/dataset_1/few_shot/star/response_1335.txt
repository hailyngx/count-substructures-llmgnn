Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 7) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 7
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify 3-stars. 

Based on the definition provided, we are looking for a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. This can be visualized as a central node with three leaves. 

Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:
<0, (1, 6, 9)>
<1, (0, 7, 2)>
<6, (0, 7, 8)>
<9, (0, 6, 0)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph and present the answer in brackets:
[4]
