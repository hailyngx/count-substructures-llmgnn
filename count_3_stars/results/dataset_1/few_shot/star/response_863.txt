Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify unique instances of 3-stars where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

From the given graph, we can identify the following unique 3-stars:
<0, (3, 5, 8)>
<0, (3, 5, 9)>
<0, (5, 8, 9)>
<1, (4, 5, 9)>
<3, (0, 4, 5)>
<4, (1, 3, 5)>
<4, (1, 4, 5)>
<5, (0, 3, 4)>
<5, (0, 4, 6)>
<6, (5, 8, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
