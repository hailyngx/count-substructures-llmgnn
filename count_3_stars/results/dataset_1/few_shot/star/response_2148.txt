Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node:

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern around that node.
Let's go step by step to find and count the 3-stars:

1. Identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
   - Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 6, and 8, forming a 3-star with center node 3 and leaves (0, 4, 6).
   - Node 4 is connected to nodes 3, 6, 8, and 9, forming a 3-star with center node 4 and leaves (3, 6, 8).
   - Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, and 4, forming a 3-star with center node 6 and leaves (0, 2, 4).
   - Node 8 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 7, and 9, forming a 3-star with center node 8 and leaves (3, 4, 7).
   - Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, 7, and 8, forming two 3-stars:
     - <9, (0, 3, 4)> and <9, (2, 7, 8)>.

2. Count the total number of unique 3-stars found:
   - <3, (0, 4, 6)>
   - <4, (3, 6, 8)>
   - <6, (0, 2, 4)>
   - <8, (3, 4, 7)>
   - <9, (0, 3, 4)>
   - <9, (2, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
