Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first identify 3-star structures by looking for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. We then form the 3-star by taking the central node and the three connected nodes.

Based on the provided edges and adjacency list, let's identify the 3-star structures:

1. Node 0 forms a 3-star: <0, (3, 4, 5)>
2. Node 2 forms a 3-star: <2, (6, 7, 8)>
3. Node 4 forms a 3-star: <4, (0, 1, 5)>
4. Node 5 forms a 3-star: <5, (0, 4, 9)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars found above, we get a total of [4].
