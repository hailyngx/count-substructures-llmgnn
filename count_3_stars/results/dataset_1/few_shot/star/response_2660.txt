Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will serve as the centers of the 3-stars. We then consider the edges between the center node and the three connected nodes to identify unique 3-stars. 

Here are the 3-stars in the graph:

<2, (3, 5, 7)>
<7, (0, 5, 8)>
