Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 8

Response:
Given the graph information, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 0: <0, (1, 2, 3)>
2. Node 1: <1, (0, 2, 3)>
3. Node 5: <5, (1, 4, 7)>
4. Node 5: <5, (1, 7, 8)>
5. Node 5: <5, (4, 7, 8)>
6. Node 9: <9, (0, 1, 5)>
7. Node 9: <9, (1, 5, 8)>

Therefore, there are a total of [7] 3-stars in the graph.
