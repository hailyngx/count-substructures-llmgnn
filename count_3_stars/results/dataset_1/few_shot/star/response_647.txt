Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 4, 6, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star-like formation. Let's find and list these unique 3-stars:

<1, (0, 6, 8)>
<4, (5, 6, 7)>
<6, (1, 4, 7)>
<7, (0, 4, 6)>
<9, (4, 6, 8)>
