Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. These instances represent the 3-stars in the graph.

By observing the given adjacency list and the edges in the graph, we can identify the 3-stars:

1. <0, (1, 4, 6)>  
2. <0, (1, 6, 7)>  
3. <0, (4, 6, 7)>  
4. <0, (6, 7, 9)>  
5. <2, (3, 5, 6)>  
6. <2, (3, 6, 7)>  
7. <2, (5, 6, 9)>  
8. <6, (0, 2, 4)>  
9. <6, (0, 2, 5)>  

Therefore, there are [9] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
