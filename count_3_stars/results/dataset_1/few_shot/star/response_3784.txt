Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star, which consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the given edges and adjacency list, we can find the following 3-stars:
<1, (4, 8, 9)>
<3, (4, 8, 9)>
<4, (1, 7, 9)>
<6, (2, 3, 9)>
<7, (0, 4, 9)>
<8, (1, 3, 9)>
<9, (1, 5, 6)>
