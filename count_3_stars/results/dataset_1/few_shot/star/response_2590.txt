Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars by finding central nodes connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list the identified 3-stars:
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<0, (2, 4, 9)>
<4, (7, 8, 9)>
<6, (1, 5, 7)>
<6, (7, 8, 9)>

There are a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
