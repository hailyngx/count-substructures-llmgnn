Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 3
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to determine all possible combinations of three nodes connected to a central node. Let's go through the process step by step:

1. Identify Central Nodes connected to exactly three other nodes:
   - Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 8.
   - Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 5, and 8.
   - Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 7, and 8.
   - Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3.

2. For each central node, find combinations of three connected nodes:
   - For Node 0: <0, (4, 5, 8)>
   - For Node 1: <1, (2, 4, 5)>, <1, (4, 5, 8)>
   - For Node 3: <3, (4, 5, 8)>
   - For Node 8: <8, (0, 1, 2)>, <8, (0, 1, 3)>

3. Count the total number of unique 3-stars:
   - <0, (4, 5, 8)>
   - <1, (2, 4, 5)>
   - <1, (4, 5, 8)>
   - <3, (4, 5, 8)>
   - <8, (0, 1, 2)>
   - <8, (0, 1, 3)>
