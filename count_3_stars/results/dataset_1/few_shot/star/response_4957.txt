Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 6, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all unique instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Here are the 3-stars in the given graph:
[<0, (3, 7, 8)>, <0, (3, 7, 9)>, <0, (3, 8, 9)>, <0, (7, 8, 9)>, <1, (3, 7, 9)>, <2, (5, 8, 9)>, <3, (0, 1, 8)>, <6, (0, 4, 9)>, <6, (0, 6, 9)>, <6, (4, 6, 9)>, <9, (0, 7, 8)>, <9, (1, 7, 8)>, <9, (2, 8, 9)>, <9, (6, 7, 9)>, <9, (7, 8, 9)>]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].
