Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 5, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star structure with itself as the center node. 

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (2, 5, 7)>
<1, (2, 3, 7)>
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<3, (1, 2, 6)>
<4, (2, 5, 7)>
<5, (0, 2, 9)>
<7, (0, 1, 9)>
<9, (2, 5, 7)>

Count of 3-stars: [8]
