Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern.

Looking at the given graph and adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<0, (1, 3, 7)>
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<0, (3, 5, 7)>
<3, (0, 4, 5)>
<3, (0, 4, 6)>
<3, (0, 5, 6)>
<3, (4, 5, 6)>
<4, (2, 5, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
