Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 6

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be found by counting the number of 3-stars around each node and summing them up. 
To count the number of 3-stars around each node, we need to find how many sets of three nodes are connected to a specific node and also connected with each other.

Let's go through the nodes one by one:

Node 0:
- <0, (1, 2, 4)>
- <0, (1, 4, 5)>
- Total 3-stars around node 0: 2

Node 1:
- <1, (0, 2, 8)>
- <1, (0, 4, 8)>
- Total 3-stars around node 1: 2

Node 2:
- <2, (0, 1, 4)>
- Total 3-stars around node 2: 1

Node 3:
- No 3-star around node 3

Node 4:
- <4, (0, 2, 5)>
- <4, (0, 5, 8)>
- Total 3-stars around node 4: 2

Node 5:
- <5, (0, 4, 9)>
- Total 3-stars around node 5: 1

Node 6:
- <6, (4, 7, 9)>
- Total 3-stars around node 6: 1

Node 7:
- No 3-star around node 7

Node 8:
- No 3-star around node 8

Node 9:
- <9, (3, 5, 6)>
- Total 3-stars around node 9: 1

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9]. 
Unique 3-stars: <0, (1, 2, 4)>, <0, (1, 4, 5)>, <1, (0, 2, 8)>, <1, (0, 4, 8)>, <2, (0, 1, 4)>, <4, (0, 2, 5)>, <4, (0, 5, 8)>, <5, (0, 4, 9)>, <6, (4, 7, 9)>.
