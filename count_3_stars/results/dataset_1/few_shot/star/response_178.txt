Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2

Response:
Let's analyze the graph to find the number of 3-stars it contains.

We need to look for nodes that have exactly 3 neighbors, as these nodes can form 3-stars where one neighbor is the center and the other two are leaves. 

Nodes with 3 neighbors in this graph are:
- Node 2 with neighbors 4, 5, 6, and 9
- Node 8 with neighbors 4, 6, 7

Now we can count the number of 3-stars in this graph:
1. <2, (4, 5, 6)>
2. <2, (4, 6, 9)>
3. <2, (5, 6, 9)>
4. <8, (4, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
