Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 6

Response:
There are two 3-stars in the given graph. 
Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<2, (1, 5, 6)>
<9, (2, 5, 6)>
