Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star. Here are the 3-stars found in the graph:

<1, (3, 4, 6)>
<1, (3, 6, 8)>
<1, (4, 5, 9)>
<1, (6, 8, 9)>
<4, (1, 5, 9)>
<6, (1, 8, 9)>
