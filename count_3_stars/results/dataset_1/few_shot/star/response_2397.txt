Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all combinations where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a 3-star pattern around the center node. 

Let's list out the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (2, 5, 7)>
<1, (5, 7, 8)>

Now, we need to count how many instances of these 3-stars appear in the graph.
