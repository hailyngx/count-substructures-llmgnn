Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars, we need to find all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a 3-star.

Let's identify the 3-stars present in the given graph:

1. Node 2 forms a 3-star: <2, (1, 5, 7)>
2. Node 5 forms a 3-star: <5, (1, 2, 7)>
3. Node 8 forms a 3-star: <8, (0, 5, 7)>

By examining the graph and adjacency list, we can see that these are the only 3-stars present in the graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].

<2, (1, 5, 7)>, <5, (1, 2, 7)>, <8, (0, 5, 7)> []
