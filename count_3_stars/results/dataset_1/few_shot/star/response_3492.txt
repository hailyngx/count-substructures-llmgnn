Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 7

Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we first need to identify the 3-stars present in the graph. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

To find the number of 3-stars, we can examine each node in the graph and see if it fits the definition of a center of a 3-star. We should look for nodes that have exactly three neighbors.

Here are the 3-stars found in the given graph:
<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<3, (0, 2, 9)>
<4, (0, 2, 7)>
<7, (0, 4, 5)>
<9, (2, 3, 4)>

Count of 3-stars: [6]
