Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star-like configuration.

Looking at the given edges, the nodes, and their connections, we can determine the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<2, (0, 5, 6)>
<3, (0, 5, 6)>
<4, (0, 6, 9)>
<5, (0, 2, 3)>
<6, (2, 3, 4)>
<6, (2, 5, 7)>
<6, (3, 5, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
