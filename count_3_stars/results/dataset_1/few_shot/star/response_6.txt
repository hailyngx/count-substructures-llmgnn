Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, 7, and node 8

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars present. 

Let's go through the nodes one by one and identify any potential 3-stars:

- Node 0: <0, (1, 5, 6)>
- Node 1: <1, (0, 6, 7)>
- Node 2: No 3-star as it has only two edges.
- Node 3: No 3-star as it has only two edges.
- Node 4: No 3-star as it has only two edges.
- Node 5: <5, (0, 7, 9)>
- Node 6: <6, (0, 1, 4)>
- Node 7: <7, (1, 5, 9)>
- Node 8: No 3-star as it has only two edges.
- Node 9: No 3-star as it has only four edges.

Count of 3-stars: [4]

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<1, (0, 6, 7)>
<5, (0, 7, 9)>
<6, (0, 1, 4)>
