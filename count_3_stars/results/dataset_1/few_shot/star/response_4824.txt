Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 4
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges, with one of them being the central node. 

Looking at the edges and adjacency list provided, we can identify the 3-star graphs in the graph: 

<0, (6, 9)>
<3, (2, 6, 9)>
<4, (5, 6, 7)>
<9, (0, 3, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [4].
