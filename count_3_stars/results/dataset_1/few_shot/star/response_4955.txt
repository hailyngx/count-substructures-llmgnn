Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 8

Response:
We can identify the 3-stars from the given graph by looking for nodes with exactly three edges connected to them. Let's go through the nodes one by one:

- Node 0: Not connected to any other nodes, so no 3-star.
- Node 1: Connected to 6 other nodes, which means it forms 6 different 3-stars: <1, (3, 4, 6)>, <1, (3, 4, 7)>, <1, (3, 8, 9)>, <1, (4, 6, 7)>, <1, (4, 8, 9)>, <1, (6, 7, 8)>.
- Node 2: Connected to 1 other node, so no 3-star.
- Node 3: Connected to 2 other nodes, so no 3-star.
- Node 4: Connected to 3 other nodes, forming 1 3-star: <4, (1, 6, 7)>.
- Node 5: Not connected to any other nodes, so no 3-star.
- Node 6: Connected to 2 other nodes, so no 3-star.
- Node 7: Connected to 2 other nodes, so no 3-star.
- Node 8: Connected to 2 other nodes, so no 3-star.
- Node 9: Connected to 2 other nodes, so no 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 7. So, the final answer is [7].
