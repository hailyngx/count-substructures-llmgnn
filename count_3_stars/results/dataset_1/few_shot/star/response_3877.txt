Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify the nodes that can act as the center of a 3-star. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we can see that node 0, node 2, node 5, and node 7 have degrees equal to 5, 2, 2, and 3 respectively. Since a 3-star requires the center node to be connected to exactly 3 other nodes, only node 0 and node 7 meet this criteria. 

Now, let's find all possible 3-stars with the center being node 0 or node 7:

For node 0:
- <0, (2, 4, 5)>
- <0, (2, 5, 7)>
- <0, (4, 5, 7)>
- <0, (7, 8, 9)>

For node 7:
- <7, (0, 6, 8)>
- <7, (6, 8, 9)>
- <7, (0, 6, 8)>

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
