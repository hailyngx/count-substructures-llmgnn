Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 6
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will serve as the centers of the 3-stars.

From the adjacency list provided, we can identify the following 3-star configurations:
<0, (5, 7, 0)>
<1, (4, 5, 6)>
<3, (4, 5, 8)>
<4, (1, 7, 3)>
<5, (0, 1, 6)>
<6, (1, 5, 3)>
<7, (0, 3, 4)>
<8, (3, 9, 3)>
<9, (8, 8, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (5, 7, 0)>, 
<1, (4, 5, 6)>, 
<3, (4, 5, 8)>, 
<4, (1, 7, 3)>, 
<5, (0, 1, 6)>, 
<6, (1, 5, 3)>, 
<7, (0, 3, 4)>, 
<8, (3, 9, 3)>, 
<9, (8, 8, 8)>
