Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 5

Response:
Let's analyze the graph to find all the 3-stars present. 

Starting with each node as the center of the 3-star, we can see which nodes are connected to the center and form a 3-star configuration where those nodes are only connected to the center node. 

Looking through the adjacency lists, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<3, (1, 4, 5)>
<4, (0, 7, 9)>
<5, (0, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4]. 

The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (1, 4, 5)>, <3, (1, 4, 5)>, <4, (0, 7, 9)>, and <5, (0, 7, 9)>.
