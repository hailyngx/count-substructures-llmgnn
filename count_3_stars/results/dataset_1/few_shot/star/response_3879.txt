Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star in the graph.

Let's go step by step:

1. Identify the nodes that are part of 3-stars:
   - Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 2, 5, 7, 8
   - Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 3, 4, 8
   - Node 2 has 5 neighbors: 0, 3, 4, 7, 8
   - Node 3 has 6 neighbors: 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 9
   - Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 5, 7
   - Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 0, 4, 6
   - Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 5, 7, 8, 9
   - Node 7 has 6 neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9
   - Node 8 has 5 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 6
   - Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 3, 6

2. Identify the 3-stars:
   - From the adjacency list, we can see the following unique 3-stars:
     <0, (2, 7, 8)>
     <1, (3, 4, 8)>
     <2, (0, 4, 7)>
     <3, (1, 2, 7)>
     <4, (1, 2, 5)>
     <5, (0, 4, 6)>
     <6, (5, 7, 9)>
     <7, (0, 3, 9)>
     <8, (1, 3, 6)>

3. Count the total number of unique 3-stars: 9

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (2, 7, 8)>, 
<1, (3, 4, 8)>, 
<2, (0, 4, 7)>, 
<3, (1, 2, 7)>, 
<4, (1, 2, 5)>, 
<5, (0, 4, 6)>, 
<6, (5, 7, 9)>, 
<7, (0, 3, 9)>, 
<8, (1, 3, 6)>.
