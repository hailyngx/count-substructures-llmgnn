Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of nodes where one node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Looking at the adjacency list, we can see that the nodes with this property are:  
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 5, and 8.  
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 8.  
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 7, and 8.  
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, 5, and 7.  
  
Let's now list all the unique 3-stars found in the graph:  
<0, (2, 4, 8)>  
<0, (2, 5, 8)>  
<0, (4, 5, 8)>  
<2, (0, 4, 8)>  
<5, (0, 1, 8)>  
<8, (0, 2, 4)>  
<8, (0, 5, 7)>  

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
