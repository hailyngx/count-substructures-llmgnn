Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 6

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star configurations in the graph:

1. Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 6: <0, (3, 6)>
2. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 4, 5: <1, (3, 4, 5)>
3. Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, 4: <3, (0, 1, 4)>
4. Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 7, 8: <6, (0, 7, 8)>

Count of 3-stars: [4]
