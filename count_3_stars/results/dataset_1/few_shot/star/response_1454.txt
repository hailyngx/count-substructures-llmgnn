Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 0) (5, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are as follows:
<[0, (3, 4, 7)]>  
<[1, (2, 5, 7)]>
<[2, (1, 6, 7)]>  

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
