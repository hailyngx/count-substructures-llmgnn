Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can identify all the unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern.

Let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

1. Node 0: {(0, 3, 8), (0, 3, 9), (0, 8, 9)} (3 different 3-stars)
2. Node 1: No 3-star pattern (as it is only connected to 2 nodes)
3. Node 2: No 3-star pattern (as it is connected to 4 nodes)
4. Node 3: No 3-star pattern (as it is connected to 4 nodes)
5. Node 4: No 3-star pattern (as it is only connected to 2 nodes)
6. Node 5: No 3-star pattern (as it is only connected to 2 nodes)
7. Node 6: {(6, 1, 9), (6, 8, 9)} (2 different 3-stars)
8. Node 7: No 3-star pattern (as it is only connected to 1 node)
9. Node 8: No 3-star pattern (as it is only connected to 2 nodes)
10. Node 9: No 3-star pattern (as it is connected to 4 nodes)

Total number of 3-stars: 3 + 2 = 5

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].

<0, (3, 8, 9)>
<6, (1, 8, 9)>
