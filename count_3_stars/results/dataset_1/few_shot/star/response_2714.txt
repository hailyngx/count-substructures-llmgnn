Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 4, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern around it. 

From the adjacency list provided, we can see that nodes 0, 6, and 7 satisfy the criteria for being the center of a 3-star graph since they each have exactly three neighboring nodes. Let's list down the 3-stars by identifying the leaves connected to each center:

<0, (1, 2, 6)>
<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<6, (4, 7, 9)>
<7, (2, 6, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
