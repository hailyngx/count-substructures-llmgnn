Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 0) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 0
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 9
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central nodes and their corresponding leaves. Let's go step-by-step:

1. List all possible 3-star configurations according to the given edges and adjacency list:
   - Node 0: (4, 5, 7), (4, 7, 9)
   - Node 1: No 3-star configuration
   - Node 2: (4, 7, 9)
   - Node 3: No 3-star configuration
   - Node 4: (0, 1, 2)
   - Node 5: No 3-star configuration
   - Node 6: No 3-star configuration
   - Node 7: (0, 2, 9)
   - Node 8: No 3-star configuration
   - Node 9: (0, 2, 7)

2. Count the total number of unique 3-star configurations: 
   - <0, (4, 5, 7)>
   - <0, (4, 7, 9)>
   - <4, (0, 1, 2)>
   - <7, (0, 2, 9)>
   - <9, (0, 2, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
