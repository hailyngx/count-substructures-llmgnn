Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 5

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star and count them. Remember, a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Given the adjacency list, we can identify the 3-stars based on the connections. Let's list the unique 3-stars:

<0, (2, 5, 7)>
<2, (0, 8, 9)>
<5, (0, 1, 8)>
<8, (2, 3, 4)>
<9, (2, 4, 5)>

Now, counting the number of unique 3-stars gives: [5].
