Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 7

Response:
First, let's find all the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 5 as leaves: <2, (4, 5)>
2. Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 9 as leaves: <4, (2, 9)>
3. Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 8 as leaves: <5, (2, 8)>
4. Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 2 as leaves: <9, (1, 2)>
5. Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 7 as leaves: <9, (4, 7)>

Therefore, there are a total of [5] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
