Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. In this case, the center node of the 3-star graph will be the node with exactly three neighbors.

For this graph:
- Node 0 is not a center of a 3-star because it has 2 neighbors.
- Node 1 is a center of a 3-star <1, (0, 3, 4)>.
- Node 2 is not a center of a 3-star because it has only 1 neighbor.
- Node 3 is not a center of a 3-star because it has more than 3 neighbors.
- Node 4 is a center of a 3-star <4, (1, 2, 5)>.
- Node 5 is not a center of a 3-star because it has 2 neighbors.
- Node 6 is not a center of a 3-star because it has only 1 neighbor.
- Node 7 is not a center of a 3-star because it has more than 3 neighbors.
- Node 8 is not a center of a 3-star because it has more than 3 neighbors.
- Node 9 is not a center of a 3-star because it has 2 neighbors.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2]. 

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<4, (1, 2, 5)>
