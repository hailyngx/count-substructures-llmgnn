Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 5

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are:
[<0, (2, 3, 7)>, <2, (0, 3, 4)>, <7, (2, 3, 4)>]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
