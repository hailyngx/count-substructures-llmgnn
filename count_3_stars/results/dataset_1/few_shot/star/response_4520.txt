Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, and node 8

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern.

Upon examining the adjacency list and the given edges, we can observe the following 3-stars in the graph:
- <0, (1, 5, 9)>
- <1, (0, 2, 5)>
- <2, (1, 4, 6)>
- <3, (4, 9, 2)>
- <4, (2, 3, 5)>
- <5, (0, 1, 4)>
- <6, (1, 2, 9)>
- <7, (5)>
- <8, (1, 9)>
- <9, (0, 1, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
