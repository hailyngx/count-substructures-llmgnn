Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, and node 6

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

There are a total of [4] 3-stars in the graph.

<1, (3, 5, 7)>
<3, (0, 1, 4)>
<3, (1, 4, 6)>
<6, (3, 7, 8)>
