Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's find the 3-stars in the graph: 

1. Node 0 <0, (2, 6, 8)>
2. Node 3 <3, (2, 4, 8)>
3. Node 4 <4, (1, 2, 3)>
4. Node 8 <8, (0, 3, 4)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
