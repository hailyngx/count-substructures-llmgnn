Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. These instances represent 3-stars in the graph.

From the adjacency list of each node, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<2, (0, 3, 8)>
<4, (0, 8, 6)>
<6, (8, 9, 0)>
<8, (1, 2, 4)>
<9, (3, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
