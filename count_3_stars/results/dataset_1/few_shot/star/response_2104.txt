Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 8

Response:
The 3-star patterns in this graph can be identified by looking for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's identify the 3-star patterns:

1. Node 2: (0, 6, 8)
2. Node 4: (2, 5, 9)
3. Node 8: (2, 6, 9)

Therefore, there are a total of [3] 3-stars in the given graph.

<2, (0, 6, 8)>
<4, (2, 5, 9)>
<8, (2, 6, 9)>
