Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in the form of a star.

Looking at the adjacency list of each node, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:
<1, (4, 6, 9)>
<2, (0, 3, 6)>
<6, (1, 2, 9)>
<9, (1, 5, 6)>

Therefore, there are a total of [4] 3-stars in the given graph.
