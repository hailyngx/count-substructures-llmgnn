Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 7
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's analyze the graph to identify the 3-stars:

1. Identify Nodes Connected to Exactly Three Other Nodes:
- Node 0 is connected to 3 other nodes: 1, 2, and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to 4 other nodes: 0, 6, 7, 8.
- Node 2 is connected to 3 other nodes: 0, 5, 7.
- Node 4 is connected to 4 other nodes: 5, 7, 8, 9.
- Node 7 is connected to 3 other nodes: 1, 2, 4.
- Node 8 is connected to 3 other nodes: 1, 4, 5.
- Node 9 is connected to 3 other nodes: 0, 1, 4.

2. Build 3-stars based on the identified nodes:
- <0, (1, 2, 9)>
- <1, (0, 6, 7)>
- <1, (0, 7, 8)>
- <1, (2, 7, 9)>
- <4, (5, 7, 9)>
- <4, (7, 8, 9)>

3. Count the total number of 3-stars: [6]

Therefore, there are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph.
