Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all occurrences where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Given the adjacency list and edges provided, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. <3, (0, 5, 9)>
2. <5, (3, 6, 9)>
3. <6, (4, 5, 9)>
4. <9, (1, 5, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
