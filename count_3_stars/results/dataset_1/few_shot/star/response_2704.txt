Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can check each node to see if it is the center of a 3-star. 

Starting with each node as the potential center, we will identify the 3 neighbors connected to it and see if they are connected to each other. If they form a triangle (a complete subgraph with 3 nodes connected by 3 edges), then we have found a 3-star.

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<1, (2, 5, 7)>
<1, (4, 7, 9)>
<1, (5, 7, 9)>
<2, (1, 5, 8)>
<3, (2, 5, 8)>
<4, (1, 7, 9)>
<4, (6, 7, 9)>

Count of 3-stars: [7]
