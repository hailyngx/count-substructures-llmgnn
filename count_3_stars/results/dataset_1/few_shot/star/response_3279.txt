Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (8, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 4
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph. Remember that a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we can see that the central nodes (with degree 3) are node 0, node 4, and node 5. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars: 
<0, (1, 4, 3)>
<4, (0, 3, 8)>
<5, (2, 3, )>

Counting the total number of 3-stars in the graph gives us [3].
