Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 0) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 5

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars in the given graph. 
A 3-star consists of a central node and three leaf nodes. Since a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes, we will look for nodes with exactly three edges. 

In this graph, nodes 1 and 8 have exactly three edges, making them potential central nodes for 3-stars. 
Let's list all the possible 3-stars with either node 1 or node 8 as the central node:

<Node 1, (2, 5, 8)>
<Node 8, (1)>
