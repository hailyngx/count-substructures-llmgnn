Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes. Here is the process:

1. For each node, check its neighbors to see if there are any 3-stars centered at that node.
2. If a node has exactly 3 neighbors, we have found a 3-star with that node as the center.
3. List the unique 3-stars found.

Let's start by examining each node's neighbors:

- Node 0: (1, 3, 4), <0, (1, 3, 4)>
- Node 1: (0, Not a 3-star)
- Node 2: (4, 6, 9), <2, (4, 6, 9)>
- Node 3: (0, 1, 5), <3, (0, 1, 5)>
- Node 4: (0, 2, 6), <4, (0, 2, 6)>
- Node 5: (3, 8, Not a 3-star)
- Node 6: (0, 2, 4), <6, (0, 2, 4)>
- Node 7: (0, 3, 9), <7, (0, 3, 9)>
- Node 8: (0, 3, 5), <8, (0, 3, 5)>
- Node 9: (0, 2, 4), <9, (0, 2, 4)>, <9, (0, 4, 7)>

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <0, (1, 3, 4)>, <2, (4, 6, 9)>, <3, (0, 1, 5)>, <4, (0, 2, 6)>, <6, (0, 2, 4)>, <7, (0, 3, 9)>, <8, (0, 3, 5)>, <9, (0, 2, 4)>, <9, (0, 4, 7)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
