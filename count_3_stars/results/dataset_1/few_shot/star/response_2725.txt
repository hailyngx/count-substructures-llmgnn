Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 3

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
- Node 0 is part of the 3-star <0, (1, 6)>
- Node 1 is part of the 3-star <1, (0, 5)> and <1, (2, 5)>
- Node 2 is part of the 3-star <2, (5, 6)> and <2, (6, 7)>
- Node 3 is part of the 3-star <3, (6, 8)> and <3, (8, 9)>
- Node 4 is part of the 3-star <4, (7, 8)>
- Node 5 is part of the 3-star <5, (1, 2)>
- Node 6 is part of the 3-star <6, (0, 2)> and <6, (2, 3)>
- Node 7 is part of the 3-star <7, (2, 4)> and <7, (4, 8)>
- Node 8 is part of the 3-star <8, (3, 4)> and <8, (4, 7)>
- Node 9 is not part of any 3-star

Since each 3-star is listed only once, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is: [9].
