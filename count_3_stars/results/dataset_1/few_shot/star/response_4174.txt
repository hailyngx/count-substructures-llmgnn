Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 6, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star configuration. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Given the adjacency list and the edge information provided, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph. Let's list the unique 3-stars found:

<0, (4, 5, 9)>
<1, (6, 8, 9)>
<2, (3, 7, 8)>
<3, (2, 5, 8)>
<4, (0, 5, 7)>
<5, (0, 3, 4)>
<6, (1, 8, 9)>
<7, (2, 4, 9)>
<8, (1, 2, 5)>
<9, (0, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
