Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's find and list all the 3-stars in this graph:

<0, (3, 4, 9)>
<3, (0, 4, 6)>
<4, (0, 3, 6)>
<6, (3, 4, 6)>
<8, (2, 7, 3)>
<9, (0, 4, 9)>
