Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 6
