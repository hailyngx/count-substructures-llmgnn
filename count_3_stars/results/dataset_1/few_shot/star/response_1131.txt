Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of nodes that form a 3-star configuration. 

Here are the 3-stars found in the graph:
[<0, (1, 3, 4)>, <0, (1, 3, 7)>, <0, (1, 4, 7)>, <3, (0, 6, 7)>, <6, (3, 7, 9)>, <7, (0, 1, 3)>, <7, (0, 1, 6)>, <7, (0, 3, 6)>, <7, (1, 6, 9)>]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
