Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, and node 6

Response:
The 3-star in this graph is defined as having a center node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's find the number of 3-stars in this graph.

For clarification, the nodes are numbered from 0 to 9.

The possible 3-stars in this graph are:
<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<2, (0, 7, 3)>
<3, (0, 6, 7)>
<6, (3, 4, 7)>
<9, (5, 6, *9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
