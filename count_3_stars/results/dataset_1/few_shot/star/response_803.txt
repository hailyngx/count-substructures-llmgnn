Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 3

Response:
The total number of 3-star graphs can be found by identifying the central nodes and their corresponding leaves. 
Given the edge list, and by examining the adjacency list for each node, we can find the 3-star graphs in this graph. 

Let's identify the central nodes and their leaves:
- Node 0 has 3 leaves: 1, 4, 7
- Node 1 has 4 leaves: 0, 3, 5, 9
- Node 3 has 4 leaves: 1, 4, 8, 9
- Node 5 has 4 leaves: 1, 6, 7, 8
- Node 7 has 3 leaves: 0, 5, 8
- Node 9 has 2 leaves: 1, 3

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars:
1. <0, (1, 4, 7)>
2. <1, (0, 3, 5)>
3. <1, (3, 5, 9)>
4. <3, (1, 4, 8)>
5. <5, (1, 6, 7)>
6. <5, (6, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
