Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 6

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 5, and 8.
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 4, and 9.
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 4, and 9.
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 5, and 9.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in this graph are:
<1, (2, 5, 8)>
<2, (1, 4, 9)>
<5, (1, 4, 9)>
<6, (4, 5, 9)>

Count of 3-stars: [4]
