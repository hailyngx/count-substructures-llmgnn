Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will look for each instance where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star. Let's identify and list the unique 3-stars found:

1. <0, (4, 7, 3)>
2. <1, (4, 3, 6)>
3. <1, (3, 8, 6)>
4. <3, (1, 4, 7)>
5. <3, (4, 8, 9)>
6. <4, (0, 1, 5)>
7. <7, (0, 3, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
