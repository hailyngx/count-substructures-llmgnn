Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars present in the graph. 

Here are the unique 3-stars in the given graph:
<0, (7, 9)> 
<1, (7, 2)>
<2, (5, 6)>
<3, (4, 5)>
<4, (3, 6)>
<5, (2, 4)>
<6, (3, 5)>
<7, (2, 6)>
<8, (9)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph.
