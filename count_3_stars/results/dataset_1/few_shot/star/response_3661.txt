Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all unique 3-stars. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list all the unique 3-stars:

<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<0, (1, 6, 8)>
<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<0, (4, 5, 8)>
<0, (5, 6, 8)>
<4, (0, 5, 9)>
<4, (0, 9, 5)>
<4, (5, 0, 9)>
<5, (0, 4, 9)>
<5, (0, 9, 4)>
<5, (4, 0, 9)>
<8, (0, 2, 3)>
<8, (0, 3, 2)>
<8, (2, 0, 3)>
<8, (3, 0, 2)>
<8, (3, 2, 0)>
<8, (2, 3, 0)>
<8, (6, 7, 9)>
<8, (6, 9, 7)>
<8, (7, 6, 9)>
<9, (4, 5, 8)>
<9, (4, 8, 5)>
<9, (5, 4, 8)>

Now, we need to count the total number of unique 3-stars listed above.
