Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first identify the 3-stars and then count them. 

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<1, (3, 7, 9)>
<2, (3, 7, 8)>
<3, (1, 2, 5)>
<3, (1, 5, 7)>
<3, (2, 5, 7)>
<3, (6, 7, 9)>
<5, (0, 3, 9)>
<6, (3, 7, 9)>

Count of 3-stars: [8]
