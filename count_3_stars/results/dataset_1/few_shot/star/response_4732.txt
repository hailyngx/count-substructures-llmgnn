Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 5, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars present. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Based on the provided adjacency list and the given edges, we can find the 3-stars:

1. <2, (0, 6, 7)>
2. <3, (1, 9, 9)>
3. <4, (8, 8, 9)>
4. <5, (9, 9, _)>
5. <6, (2, 2, 8)>
6. <7, (2, _, _)>
7. <8, (1, 4, 6)>
8. <9, (2, 3, 4)>
9. <9, (3, 4, 5)>
10. <9, (4, 5, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
