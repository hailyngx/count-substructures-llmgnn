Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 6

Response:
The 3-star graph consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

To determine the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible 3-star configurations. Let's list them down: 

<1, (3, 4, 2)>
<4, (0, 1, 9)>
<5, (6, 7, 8)>
<6, (5, 8, 9)>
<7, (3, 5, 8)>
<9, (2, 4, 6)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars from the list above, we get a total of [6].
