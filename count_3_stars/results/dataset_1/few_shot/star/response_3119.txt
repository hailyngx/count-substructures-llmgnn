Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 8

Response:
First, we need to identify the 3-stars in this graph. Let's list them step by step.

1. Node 0 forms a 3-star: <0, (2, 4, 5)>
2. Node 1 does not form a 3-star as it is connected to 2 nodes only.
3. Node 2 forms a 3-star: <2, (1, 3, 4)>
4. Node 3 does not form a 3-star as it is connected to 2 nodes only.
5. Node 4 forms a 3-star: <4, (0, 2, 5)>
6. Node 5 forms a 3-star: <5, (2, 4, 8)>
7. Node 6 cannot form a 3-star as it is not connected to any other nodes.
8. Node 7 does not form a 3-star as it is connected to 2 nodes only.
9. Node 8 forms a 3-star: <8, (2, 5, 9)>
10. Node 9 does not form a 3-star as it is connected to 2 nodes only.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [4]. 

Unique 3-stars: 
<0, (2, 4, 5)>, 
<2, (1, 3, 4)>, 
<4, (0, 2, 5)>, 
<5, (2, 4, 8)>
