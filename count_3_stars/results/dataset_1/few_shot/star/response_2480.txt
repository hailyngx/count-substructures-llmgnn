Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, and node 7

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we can look at each node and its neighbors to identify 3-stars with that node as the center. 

Let's analyze each node:
- Node 0: No 3-stars as it is connected to only one node.
- Node 1: No 3-stars as it is connected to only two nodes.
- Node 2: Possible 3-star <2, (4, 5, 7)>, <2, (4, 5, 8)>, <2, (4, 7, 9)>, <2, (5, 7, 8)>, <2, (5, 7, 9)>, <2, (5, 8, 9)>, <2, (7, 8, 9)>. (7 different variations)
- Node 3: No 3-stars as it is connected to only one node.
- Node 4: No 3-stars as it is connected to only two nodes.
- Node 5: Possible 3-star <5, (0, 1, 2)>, <5, (0, 1, 8)>, <5, (1, 2, 4)>, <5, (1, 2, 8)>, <5, (2, 4, 8)>. (5 different variations)
- Node 6: No 3-stars as it is connected to only one node.
- Node 7: No 3-stars as it is connected to only three nodes.
- Node 8: No 3-stars as it is connected to only three nodes.
- Node 9: No 3-stars as it is connected to only three nodes.

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7 + 5 = 12].

Unique 3-stars: 
<2, (4, 5, 7)>, <2, (4, 5, 8)>, <2, (4, 7, 9)>, <2, (5, 7, 8)>, <2, (5, 7, 9)>, <2, (5, 8, 9)>, <2, (7, 8, 9)>
<5, (0, 1, 2)>, <5, (0, 1, 8)>, <5, (1, 2, 4)>, <5, (1, 2, 8)>, <5, (2, 4, 8)>
