Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 2

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify all possible sets of 3 nodes where one node is connected to the other two nodes but the two nodes are not directly connected to each other. In this case, we will be looking for all occurrences where a node is connected to three other nodes forming a 3-star pattern.

Let's go through each node and its connections to identify the 3-stars:
1. Node 0: No 3-star as it has only one connection.
2. Node 1: <1, (2, 4, 6)>, <1, (2, 8, 9)>, <1, (4, 6, 8)>
3. Node 2: No 3-star as it has only two connections.
4. Node 3: No connections.
5. Node 4: No 3-star as it has only two connections.
6. Node 5: No connections.
7. Node 6: No 3-star as it has only two connections.
8. Node 7: <7, (0, 4, 6)>
9. Node 8: No 3-star as it has only one connection.
10. Node 9: No 3-star as it has only two connections.

In total, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<1, (2, 8, 9)>
<1, (4, 6, 8)>
