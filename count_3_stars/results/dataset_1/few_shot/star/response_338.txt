Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars step by step:

1. Central node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 7. No 3-star centered at node 0 because it doesn't meet the criteria of exactly three other nodes.

2. Central node 1 is connected to only node 0. No 3-star centered at node 1 because it doesn't meet the criteria of exactly three other nodes.

3. Central node 2 is connected to nodes 0 and 8. No 3-star centered at node 2 because it doesn't meet the criteria of exactly three other nodes.

4. Central node 3 is connected to only node 7. No 3-star centered at node 3 because it doesn't meet the criteria of exactly three other nodes.

5. Central node 4 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 8. There is a 3-star: <4, (5, 6, 8)>.

6. Central node 5 is connected to only node 4. No 3-star centered at node 5 because it doesn't meet the criteria of exactly three other nodes.

7. Central node 6 is connected to only node 4. No 3-star centered at node 6 because it doesn't meet the criteria of exactly three other nodes.

8. Central node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 6. No 3-star centered at node 7 because it doesn't meet the criteria of exactly three other nodes.

9. Central node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 5, and 9. No 3-star was found centered at node 8 because it doesn't meet the criteria of exactly three other nodes.

10. Central node 9 is connected to only node 8. No 3-star centered at node 9 because it doesn't meet the criteria of exactly three other nodes.

Final count: [1]

Unique 3-star: <4, (5, 6, 8)>
