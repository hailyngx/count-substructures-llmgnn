Response:
To identify the 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through each node one by one:

For Node 0:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2 and 4. These connections form a 3-star centered at Node 0. <0, (2, 4)>
  
For Node 1:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2 and 4. These connections form another 3-star centered at Node 1. <1, (2, 4)>  

For Node 2:
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, and 4. Among these connections, there are two possible 3-stars: <2, (0, 1, 4)> and <2, (0, 1, 3)>

For Node 3:
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 8, and 9. This connection forms a 3-star centered at Node 3. <3, (2, 8, 9)>  

For Node 4:
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 7. These connections form a 3-star centered at Node 4. <4, (0, 1, 7)>  

For Node 5:
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 6, 8, and 9. This connection forms a 3-star centered at Node 5. <5, (6, 8, 9)>  

For Node 6:
- Node 6 is connected only to Node 5. This connection doesn't form a 3-star.

For Node 7:
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2 and 4. These connections form another 3-star centered at Node 7. <7, (2, 4)>  

For Node 8:
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 3 and 5. This connection doesn't form a 3-star.

For Node 9:
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 3 and 5. This connection doesn't form a 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].  
The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (2, 4)>, <1, (2, 4)>, <2, (0, 1, 4)>, <2, (0, 1, 3)>, <3, (2, 8, 9)>, <4, (0, 1, 7)>, <5, (6, 8, 9)>, <7, (2, 4)>
