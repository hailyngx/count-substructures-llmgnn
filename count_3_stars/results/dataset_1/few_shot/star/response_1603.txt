Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 7

Response:
Starting from each node in the graph, count the number of 3-stars that can be formed. 

For Node 0:
- No 3-star since it has only 1 edge connected.

For Node 1:
- No 3-star since it has only 1 edge connected.

For Node 2:
- No 3-star since it has only 1 edge connected.

For Node 3:
- No 3-star since it has only 1 edge connected.

For Node 4: 
- 3-star <4, (0, 7, 8)>
- 3-star <4, (7, 6, 8)>
- Total: 2

For Node 5:
- No 3-star since it has only 2 edges connected.

For Node 6: 
- 3-star <6, (2, 5, 7)>
- 3-star <6, (5, 7, 8)>
- 3-star <6, (7, 4, 8)>
- Total: 3

For Node 7:
- No 3-star since it has only 3 edges connected.

For Node 8: 
- No 3-star since it has only 2 edges connected.

For Node 9:
- No 3-star since it has only 2 edges connected.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].  
The unique 3-stars are <4, (0, 7, 8)>, <4, (7, 6, 8)>, <6, (2, 5, 7)>, <6, (5, 7, 8)>, and <6, (7, 4, 8)>.
