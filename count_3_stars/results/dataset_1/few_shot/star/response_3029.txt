Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star subgraphs in the given graph. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we can see that the central node (the node with exactly three edges) can be nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, or 9. 

Let's go through each possible central node and check if it has exactly three connected nodes (leaves) to form a 3-star:

For central node 0: 
Node 0 is connected to 4, 5, 6, and 8. This forms a 3-star: <0, (4, 5, 6)>. 

For central node 1:
Node 1 is connected to 2, 3, and 8. This forms a 3-star: <1, (2, 3, 8)>.

For central node 2:
Node 2 is connected to 1, 4, and 5. This forms a 3-star: <2, (1, 4, 5)>.

For central node 3:
Node 3 is connected to 1 and 9, but it does not have exactly three connected nodes to form a 3-star.

For central node 4:
Node 4 is connected to 0, 2, 6, and 8. This forms a 3-star: <4, (0, 2, 6)>.

For central node 5:
Node 5 is connected to 0, 2, 7, and 8. This forms a 3-star: <5, (0, 2, 7)>.

For central node 6:
Node 6 is connected to 0, 4, 8, and 9. This forms a 3-star: <6, (0, 4, 9)>.

For central node 8:
Node 8 is connected to 0, 1, 4, 5, and 6. This forms two 3-stars: <8, (0, 1, 4)> and <8, (0, 5, 6)>.

For central node 9:
Node 9 is connected to 3 and 6, but it does not have exactly three connected nodes to form a 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6]. The unique 3-star subgraphs are listed below within <>: <0, (4, 5, 6)>, <1, (2, 3, 8)>, <2, (1, 4, 5)>, <4, (0, 2, 6)>, <5, (0, 2, 7)>, <6, (0, 4, 9)>.
