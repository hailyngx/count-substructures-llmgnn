Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 6

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph:

- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 4, and 6: <0, (1, 4, 6)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 2, and 5: <1, (0, 2, 5)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 2, and 5: <3, (1, 2, 5)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 2, and 6: <4, (0, 2, 6)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, and 5: <9, (1, 3, 5)>

Therefore, there are a total of [5] 3-star graphs in the given graph.
