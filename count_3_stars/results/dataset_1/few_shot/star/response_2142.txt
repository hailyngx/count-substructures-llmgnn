Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 8

Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 5, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all occurrences of 3-stars. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Looking at the adjacency list for each node, we can identify the following unique 3-stars with their central node and leaf nodes:
  
  1. <0, (1, 2, 5)>
  2. <1, (0, 3, 4)>
  3. <2, (0, 4, 6)>
  4. <3, (1, 4, 5)>
  5. <4, (1, 2, 3)>
  6. <5, (0, 3, 9)>
  7. <6, (2, 9)>
  8. <7, (1, 2, 3)>
  9. <8, (0, 1, 2)>
  10. <9, (1, 3, 4)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars found above, we get a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
