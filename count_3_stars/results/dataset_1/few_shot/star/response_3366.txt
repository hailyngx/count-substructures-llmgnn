Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we find that the node 0, node 1, node 3, and node 7 have a degree of 3, making them potential central nodes of 3-stars. 

Let's now list the unique 3-stars found in this graph:

<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<0, (3, 5, 9)>
<0, (3, 6, 9)>
<0, (5, 6, 9)>
<1, (4, 7, 9)>
<3, (0, 5, 7)>
<3, (0, 7, 9)>
<3, (5, 7, 9)>
<7, (1, 4, 9)>
<7, (1, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
