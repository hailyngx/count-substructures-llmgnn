Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 5, and node 7

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. For Node 0:
   - No 3-star as it is connected to less than 3 nodes.

2. For Node 1:
   - <1, (0, 7, 9)>

3. For Node 2:
   - No 3-star as it is connected to less than 3 nodes.

4. For Node 3:
   - No 3-star as it is connected to less than 3 nodes.

5. For Node 4:
   - No 3-star as it is connected to less than 3 nodes.

6. For Node 5:
   - No 3-star as it is connected to less than 3 nodes.

7. For Node 6:
   - No 3-star as it is connected to less than 3 nodes.

8. For Node 7:
   - No 3-star as it is connected to less than 3 nodes.

9. For Node 8:
   - No 3-star as it is connected to less than 3 nodes.

10. For Node 9:
   - <9, (0, 1, 7)>
   - <9, (0, 4, 5)>
   - <9, (1, 4, 7)>
   - <9, (1, 5, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6]. 
The unique 3-stars found are <1, (0, 7, 9)>, <9, (0, 1, 7)>, <9, (0, 4, 5)>, <9, (1, 4, 7)>, <9, (1, 5, 7)>.
