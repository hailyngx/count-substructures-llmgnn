Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 8

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 8, 9)>
<1, (3, 6, 9)>
<2, (5, 8, 9)>
