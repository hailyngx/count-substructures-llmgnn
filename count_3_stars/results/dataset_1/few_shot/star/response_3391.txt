Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 9
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 4

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph can be counted as follows:

1. For node 0: <0, (3, 4, 8)> and <0, (3, 4, 9)>
2. For node 1: <1, (3, 6, 8)>
3. For node 2: No 3-stars as it is connected to only two nodes.
4. For node 3: <3, (0, 1, 4)>
5. For node 4: <4, (0, 2, 3)> and <4, (0, 3, 9)>
6. Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
7. For node 6: No 3-stars as it is connected to only two nodes.
8. For node 7: No 3-stars as it is connected to only one node.
9. For node 8: No new 3-stars as they were already counted above.
10. For node 9: No new 3-stars as they were already counted above.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
