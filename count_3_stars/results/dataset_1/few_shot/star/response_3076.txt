Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify sets of nodes that form a 3-star configuration around a central node. In this case, the central node will be the one connected to exactly three other nodes.

From the provided adjacency list, we can identify the central nodes as 0, 3, 4, and 6 since they each have exactly three neighboring nodes.

For each central node, we can construct the 3-star configurations by considering the nodes that are connected to the central node. Let's list the unique 3-stars found:

<0, (2, 5, 8)>
<3, (6, 7, 9)>
<4, (6, 7, 9)>
<6, (1, 3, 4)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we get:
[4]
