Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 5, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first understand what a 3-star looks like in this context. 

Since a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we will look for nodes with exactly three neighboring nodes. We will then identify the 3-stars based on these nodes. 

Let's start by finding the nodes with exactly three neighbors:

- Nodes 0, 2, and 8 have 2 neighbors each.
- Nodes 1, 5, and 6 have 1 neighbor each.
- Nodes 7 and 8 have 4 neighbors each.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors.

Therefore, the nodes that can potentially act as central nodes of 3-stars are 3 and 4.

Next, let's list out the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<3, (4, 6, 9)>
<4, (0, 7, 9)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
