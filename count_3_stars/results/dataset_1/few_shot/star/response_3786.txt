Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible occurrences of the 3-star pattern, which consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's go through each node in the graph and list the 3-stars:

1. For node 0:
   <0, (1, 7, 8)>
   <0, (1, 8, 9)>
   [2]

2. For node 1:
   <1, (0, 5, 8)>
   [1]

3. For node 2:
   <2, (0, 3, 7)>
   <2, (0, 6, 8)>
   [2]

4. For node 3: No 3-stars as it is connected to only two nodes.

5. For node 4: No 3-stars as it is connected to only one node.

6. For node 5: No 3-stars as it is connected to only one node.

7. For node 6: No new 3-star, already counted in Node 2.

8. For node 7:
   <7, (0, 2, 8)>
   [1]

9. For node 8: 
   <8, (0, 1, 9)>
   [1]

10. For node 9: No 3-stars as it is connected to only one node.

Now, summing up the counted 3-stars for each node, we have a total of [2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1] = [7] 3-stars in the given graph.
