Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 6

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes of the 3-stars in the given graph. 
- Node 1, 3, 4, 6 are potential central nodes since each of them have exactly 3 neighbors.

Now, let's consider each potential central node and find the corresponding leaves for each one:
1. For central node 1, the 3-stars are: 
   <1, (2, 4, 5)>
   
2. For central node 3, the 3-stars are:
   <3, (1, 4, 7)>

3. For central node 4, the 3-stars are:
   <4, (1, 3, 6)>
   <4, (1, 6, 9)>

4. For central node 6, the 3-stars are:
   <6, (0, 1, 7)>
   <6, (1, 2, 4)>
   <6, (1, 4, 9)>
   <6, (0, 4, 7)>
   
   Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
   The unique 3-stars are: <1, (2, 4, 5)>, <3, (1, 4, 7)>, <4, (1, 3, 6)>, <4, (1, 6, 9)>, <6, (0, 1, 7)>, <6, (1, 2, 4)>, <6, (0, 4, 7)>
