Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 8) (3, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 6, and node 8

Response:
The 3-stars can be found by identifying nodes that have exactly 3 neighbors and then checking if they form a 3-star. 

Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (0, 5, 7)>
2. Node 8 forms a 3-star: <8, (2, 4, 9)>

Therefore, there are [2] 3-stars in the given graph.
