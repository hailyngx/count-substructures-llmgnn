Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 5, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star present. 

Let's list all the 3-stars in the graph first:
<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<0, (2, 6, 8)>
<0, (3, 6, 9)>
<0, (4, 2, 8)>
<0, (6, 2, 8)>
<2, (0, 6, 8)>
<2, (5, 8, 9)>
<2, (6, 0, 8)>
<2, (6, 7, 9)>
<3, (0, 6, 9)>
<4, (0, 2, 8)>
<5, (2, 8, 9)>
<6, (0, 2, 8)>
<6, (2, 0, 8)>
<6, (2, 7, 9)>
<7, (3, 6, 9)>
<8, (0, 2, 4)>
<8, (0, 4, 6)>
<8, (0, 5, 9)>
<8, (2, 0, 6)>
<8, (2, 5, 9)>
<8, (4, 0, 6)>
<8, (5, 2, 9)>
<9, (0, 3, 6)>
<9, (1, 2, 7)>
<9, (3, 0, 7)>
<9, (5, 2, 8)>
<9, (6, 2, 7)>

Now, we count the total number of unique 3-stars:
[28]
