Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 6
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 20 edges, the 3-star graphs can be identified by finding nodes that have exactly 3 neighbors and ensuring that there is an edge between the center node and each leaf node.

Based on the information provided, the nodes that satisfy the conditions for being the center of a 3-star graph are nodes 2, 3, and 8. Now, let's identify the unique 3-stars:

<2, (3, 4, 7)>
<3, (0, 2, 5)>
<8, (1, 2, 6)>

There are [3] 3-stars in the given graph.
