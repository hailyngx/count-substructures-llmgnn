Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern with itself as the center.

By examining the adjacency list for each node, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (1, 7, 8)>
<1 (0, 3, 4)>
<2 (4, 5, 6)>
<6 (2, 3, 5)>
<8 (0, 6, 0)>

Now, we count the total number of unique 3-stars found:
