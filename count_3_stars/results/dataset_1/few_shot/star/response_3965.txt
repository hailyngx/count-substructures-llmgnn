Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, and node 7

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 2 forms a 3-star <2, (0, 5, 6)>
2. Node 5 forms a 3-star <5, (2, 6, 9)>
3. Node 6 forms a 3-star <6, (2, 5, 8)>
4. Node 8 forms a 3-star <8, (3, 6, 9)>
5. Node 9 forms a 3-star <9, (5, 7, 8)>

So, there are a total of [5] 3-stars in the graph.
