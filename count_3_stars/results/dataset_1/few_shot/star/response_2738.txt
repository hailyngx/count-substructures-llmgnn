Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern in the graph.

Looking at the definition of a 3-star graph, we need to find all sets of nodes where one node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Analyzing the given graph, we find the following 3-star patterns:
<0, (4, 9)>
<1, (3, 7)>
<2, (4, 9)>
<3, (1, 7, 8)>
<4, (0, 2)>
<5, (6, 7)>
<6, (5, 8, 9)>
<7, (1, 3, 5)>
<8, (3, 6, 9)>
<9, (0, 2, 6, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-star patterns in the given graph is [9].
