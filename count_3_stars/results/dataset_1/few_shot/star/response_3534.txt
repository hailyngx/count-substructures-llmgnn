Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 46 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes. These instances represent 3-stars with that node as the center.

Based on the provided adjacency list, the valid 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 3, 5)>
<0, (2, 3, 8)>
<0, (2, 5, 8)>
<0, (3, 5, 9)>
<0, (5, 8, 9)>
<2, (0, 5, 8)>
<3, (0, 5, 9)>
<5, (0, 2, 3)>
<5, (0, 3, 9)>
<5, (2, 3, 6)>
<5, (3, 6, 9)>
<6, (2, 3, 5)>
<9, (0, 3, 5)>
<9, (0, 5, 8)>
<9, (3, 5, 6)>
