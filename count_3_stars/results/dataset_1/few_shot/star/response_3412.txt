Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 8

Response:
Given graph information:
- Total nodes: 10
- Total edges: 36

To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all unique 3-stars. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the unique 3-stars in the graph:

Identifying 3-stars:
<2, (5, 7, 9)>
<8, (1, 7, 9)>
