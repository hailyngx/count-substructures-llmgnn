Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 7

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars. Let's break down the process step-by-step:

1. Identify nodes connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 0, Node 3, Node 6, and Node 8 are the nodes connected to exactly three other nodes.

2. Check if these nodes form 3-stars:
- Node 0: (0, 3, 4, 7)
- Node 3: (3, 0, 5, 6)
- Node 6: (6, 1, 2, 3, 8)
- Node 8: (8, 5, 6)

3. List the unique 3-stars:
<0, (3, 4, 7)>
<3, (0, 5, 6)>
<6, (1, 2, 3, 8)>
<8, (5, 6)>

4. Count the total number of unique 3-stars: [4]

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
