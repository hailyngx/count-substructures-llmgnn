Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 6

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0 forms a 3-star with leaves 2, 4, and 8 <0, (2, 4, 8)>
2. Node 1 forms a 3-star with leaves 3, 5, and 7 <1, (3, 5, 7)>
3. Node 6 forms a 3-star with leaves 1, 4, and 8 <6, (1, 4, 8)>
4. Node 6 forms a 3-star with leaves 1, 4, and 9 <6, (1, 4, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
