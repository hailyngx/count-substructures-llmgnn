Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 5, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify sets of nodes where one node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Here are the 3-stars found in the graph:

<1, (2, 7, 8)>
<2, (1, 3, 7)>
<4, (7, 9, 5)>
<5, (7, 9, 4)>
<6, (0, 9, 7)>
<7, (2, 4, 5)>
<8, (1, 7, 2)>
<9, (0, 6, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
