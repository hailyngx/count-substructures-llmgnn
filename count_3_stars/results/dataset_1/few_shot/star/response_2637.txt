Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all unique instances of 3-stars in the graph. 

Let's list down the unique 3-stars present in the graph:

<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<1, (0, 5, 6)>
<4, (0, 6, 9)>
<5, (0, 1, 8)>
<6, (0, 1, 9)>

Now let's count the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph [5].
