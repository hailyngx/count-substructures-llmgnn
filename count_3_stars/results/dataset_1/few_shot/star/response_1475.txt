Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, and node 7

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

Node 0 forms a 3-star: <0, (2, 3, 8)>
Node 2 forms a 3-star: <2, (0, 3, 4)>
Node 3 forms a 3-star: <3, (0, 1, 2)>
Node 4 forms a 3-star: <4, (2, 3, 5)>
Node 5 forms a 3-star: <5, (1, 2, 4)>
Node 6 forms a 3-star: <6, (2, 4, 7)>
Node 8 forms a 3-star: <8, (0, 3, 5)>
Node 9 forms a 3-star: <9, (2, 3, 6)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we have a total of [8].
