Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star pattern, which consists of a central node connected to three other nodes. 

Let's go through each node and check if it is the central node of a 3-star graph:

1. Node 0: (0, 2, 8), (0, 3, 7) [2 unique 3-stars]
2. Node 1: No 3-star since it has less than 3 neighbors.
3. Node 2: (2, 0, 4), (2, 0, 6), (2, 0, 9) [3 unique 3-stars]
4. Node 3: No 3-star since it has less than 3 neighbors.
5. Node 4: (4, 2, 6) [1 unique 3-star]
6. Node 5: No 3-star since it has less than 3 neighbors.
7. Node 6: No 3-star since it has less than 3 neighbors.
8. Node 7: (7, 0, 9) [1 unique 3-star]
9. Node 8: No 3-star since it has less than 3 neighbors.
10. Node 9: No 3-star since it has less than 3 neighbors.

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars in the given graph is [9]. 

Unique 3-stars: 
<0, (2, 8), (3, 7)>
<2, (0, 4, 6), (0, 6, 9), (0, 4, 9)>
<4, (2, 6)>
<7, (0, 9)>
