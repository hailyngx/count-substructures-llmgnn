Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 4, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 6

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the graph. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we can see that nodes 0, 4, and 6 are connected to 3 other nodes, making them potential central nodes of 3-stars.

Let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (1, 5, 9)>
<0, (2, 3, 6)>
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<0, (6, 7, 9)>
<4, (2, 3, 7)>
<4, (5, 6, 7)>
<6, (0, 4, 9)>
<6, (4, 7, 9)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars. All the listed 3-stars are unique, so the total count is [8].
