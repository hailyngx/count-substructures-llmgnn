Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 5

Response:
Step 1: Identify the nodes that are part of any 3-star configurations:
- Nodes with 3 edges: 2, 3, and 7
- Nodes with 4 edges: 0, 1, 5, 8, and 9

Step 2: Identify the 3-star configurations:
- For nodes with 3 edges: 
  - Node 2 forms a 3-star with leaves 3, 4, and 7: <2, (3, 4, 7)>
  - Node 3 has only one edge and cannot form a 3-star.

- For nodes with 4 edges:
  - Node 0 forms a 3-star with leaves 4, 6, and 8: <0, (4, 6, 8)> and <0, (4, 6, 9)>
  - Node 1 forms a 3-star with leaves 4, 6, and 8: <1, (4, 6, 8)> and <1, (4, 6, 9)>
  - Node 5 forms a 3-star with leaves 4, 6, and 9: <5, (4, 6, 9)>
  - Node 8 forms a 3-star with leaves 0, 1, and 6: <8, (0, 1, 6)>
  - Node 9 forms a 3-star with leaves 0, 1, and 5: <9, (0, 1, 5)>

Step 3: Count the total number of unique 3-stars: [6]

Therefore, the final answer is [6].
