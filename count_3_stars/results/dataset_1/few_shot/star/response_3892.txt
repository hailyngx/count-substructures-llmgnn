Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's identify the 3-stars: 
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 6, and 7: <0, (1, 6, 7)>
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 9: <1, (0, 3, 9)>
- Node 2 is not part of any 3-star as it has connection to 2 nodes.
- Node 3 is not part of any 3-star as it has connection to 2 nodes.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 8, and 9: <4, (2, 8, 9)>
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 8: <5, (4, 6, 8)>
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 5, and 9: <6, (0, 5, 9)>
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 9: <7, (0, 2, 9)>
- Node 8 is not part of any 3-star as it has connection to 4 nodes.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 7: <9, (1, 4, 7)> and <9, (0, 4, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].  
The unique 3-stars are <0, (1, 6, 7)>, <1, (0, 3, 9)>, <4, (2, 8, 9)>, <5, (4, 6, 8)>, <6, (0, 5, 9)>, <7, (0, 2, 9)>
