Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible 3-stars by finding nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list down all the possible 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (1, 4, 7)>
<1, (0, 3, 7)>
<2, (8, 9)>
<3, (1, 4)>
<4, (0, 3, 5)>
<5, (4, 7)>
<6, (0)>
<7, (0, 1, 5)>
<8, (2, 9)>
<9, (2, 8)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph: [9]
