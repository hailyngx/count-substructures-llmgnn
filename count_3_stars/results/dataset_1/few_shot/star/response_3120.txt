Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star, which consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through the information provided step by step.

1. Based on the given edges and adjacency list, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:
   
    a. For each node, check if it is connected to exactly three other nodes. If so, it forms a 3-star.
    
    b. List all unique 3-stars found in the graph.

2. Identify the 3-stars:

    - Node 8: <8, (0, 2, 3)>
    - Node 9: <9, (3, 4, 7)>
    
3. Count the total number of 3-stars identified: 2.
