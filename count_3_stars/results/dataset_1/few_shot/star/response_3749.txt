Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through the adjacency list and identify all the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 3, and 4: <0, (2, 3, 4)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 9, and 6: <2, (0, 9, 6)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 5, and 9: <8, (2, 5, 9)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
