Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 6

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars in the graph where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list out the 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (3, 7, 8)>
<0, (3, 7, 9)>
<0, (3, 8, 9)>
<0, (7, 8, 9)>
<4, (1, 9, 7)>
<6, (5, 9, 0)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph [6].
