Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the nodes that serve as the center of a 3-star and their neighboring nodes.

To find the 3-stars:
1. Iterate through each node in the graph.
2. For each node, check if it has exactly 3 neighbors.
3. If a node has exactly 3 neighbors, then it is the center of a 3-star, and its neighbors are the leaves of the 3-star.

Let's identify the 3-stars:

There is 1 unique 3-star in this graph. Therefore, the answer is [1].

<0, (1, 6, 8)>
