Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 8

Response:
To find the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph, we need to identify all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's go through the adjacency list for each node and identify the 3-stars:

1. From the adjacency list:
   - Node 0 is a central node of a 3-star: <0, (2, 8, 9)>
   - Node 2 is a central node of a 3-star: <2, (0, 3, 9)>
   - Node 3 is a central node of a 3-star: <3, (2, 5, 9)>
   - Node 4 does not form a 3-star.
   - Node 5 does not form a 3-star.
   - Node 6 does not form a 3-star.
   - Node 7 does not form a 3-star.
   - Node 8 does not form a 3-star.
   - Node 9 does not form a 3-star.

Therefore, the 3-star graphs in the given graph are <0, (2, 8, 9)>, <2, (0, 3, 9)>, and <3, (2, 5, 9)>. This results in a total of [3] 3-star graphs.
