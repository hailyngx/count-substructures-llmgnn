Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Looking at the adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (1, 7, 9)>
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<5, (1, 4, 6)>
<6, (1, 3, 5)>
<7, (0, 2, 3)>
<8, (1, 6, X)> (Note: Node 8 is almost part of a 3-star, but it only connects to two other nodes. Let's keep track of this case for later.)

Counting these unique 3-stars, we have found 6 so far. 
Now let's revisit node 8 to see if there is a valid 3-star including node 8.

<8, (1, 6, X)> indicates that node 8 is almost part of a 3-star, but it lacks one connection to form a complete 3-star. Therefore, we don't count this as a valid 3-star.

In conclusion, there are a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
