Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 7
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 6, and node 8

Response:
Since a 3-star graph consists of a center node and three leaves, we can look for each node that has exactly three neighbors.  

The nodes that have exactly three neighbors are nodes 0, 1, 6, 7, and 8.  

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found in this graph:
<0, (2, 4, 8)>
<1, (3, 4, 6)>
<6, (1, 9, 8)>
<7, (2, 3, 4)>
<8, (0, 9, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
