Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 8) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 3

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Determine the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
   - Node 0, Node 1, Node 2, Node 3, Node 4, and Node 8 are connected to exactly three other nodes.

2. List all unique 3-stars:
   - <0, (1, 2, 4)>
   - <1, (0, 2, 4)>
   - <2, (0, 1, 5)>
   - <3, (4, 5, 9)>
   - <4, (0, 1, 3)>
   - <8, (4, 6, 7)>

3. Count the total number of unique 3-stars: [6]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
