Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 8

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 26 edges, let's identify and count the number of 3-stars in the graph.

The definition of a 3-star is a central node connected to exactly 3 other nodes. Based on the adjacency list provided, we can identify the following 3-stars:

<0, (4, 5, 9)>
<2, (6, 7, 8)>
<8, (1, 6, 7)>
<9, (0, 2, 4)>

Counting these unique 3-stars, we have a total of [4] 3-stars.
