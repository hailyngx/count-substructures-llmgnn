Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 5

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are:

<1, (2, 8, 9)>
<2, (1, 3, 4)>
<6, (0, 2, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
