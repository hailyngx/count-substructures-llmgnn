Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 8) (2, 9) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a star pattern. 

After analyzing the given adjacency list, we find the following 3-stars: 

<0, (5, 7, 8)>
<5, (0, 6, 9)>
<7, (0, 4, 6)>

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
