Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 5) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 1

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a 3-star pattern. 

Looking at the graph and adjacency list, we see that Node 5 has connections to nodes 1, 3, 4, and 7. This means there are potential 3-stars centered at Node 5.

The 3-stars centered at Node 5 are: 
<5, (1, 3, 4)>
<5, (1, 3, 7)>
<5, (1, 4, 7)>
<5, (3, 4, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
