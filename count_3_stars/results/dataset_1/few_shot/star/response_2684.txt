Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 7

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<4, (0, 5, 9)>
<5, (0, 4, 9)>
<9, (2, 4, 7)>
