Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the nodes that can act as the center of a 3-star and then check if they are indeed connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Upon examining the adjacency list, we see that nodes 0, 1, 7, and 9 have the potential to be centers of 3-stars since they have exactly three neighbors each.

Now, let's check if these nodes satisfy the requirements of being a center of a 3-star:

1. Node 0: (0, 2, 6, 7)
    - 3-star found: <0, (2, 6, 7)>

2. Node 1: (1, 5, 9)
    - 3-star found: <1, (5, 9)>

3. Node 7: (7, 0, 9)
    - 3-star found: <7, (0, 9)>

4. Node 9: (9, 1, 3, 7)
    - 3-star found: <9, (1, 3, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 6, 7)>, <1, (5, 9)>, <7, (0, 9)>, <9, (1, 3, 7)>
