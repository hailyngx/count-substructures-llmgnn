Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 2

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Here's the breakdown of 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 7, and 8. (<0, (3, 7, 8)>)
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 5, and 8. (<1, (4, 5, 8)>)
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 7, and 9. (<2, (6, 7, 9)>)
- Node 3 forms two 3-stars: one with nodes 0, 4, and 8, and another with nodes 6, 5, and 2. (<3, (0, 4, 8)>, <3, (6, 5, 2)>)
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, and 7. (<4, (1, 3, 7)>)
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 4, and 6. (<5, (1, 4, 6)>)
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 3, and 5. (<6, (2, 3, 5)>)
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 2, and 4. (<7, (0, 2, 4)>)
- Node 8 forms two 3-stars: one with nodes 0, 1, and 3, and another with nodes 7, 4, and 5. (<8, (0, 1, 3)>, <8, (7, 4, 5)>)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
