Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a 3-star pattern.

Looking at the given graph and the adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<0, (1, 4, 9)>
<0, (2, 3, 8)>
<0, (4, 8, 9)>
<3, (5, 6, 7)>
<8, (0, 6, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
