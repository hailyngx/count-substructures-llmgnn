Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 1

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star. 

Based on the given adjacency list and the definition of a 3-star graph, we can identify the following unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 2, 7)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<2, (0, 4, 5)>
<3, (1, 4, 7)>
<4, (1, 2, 3)>
<5, (2, 4, 6)>
<6, (5)>
<7, (0, 3, 4)>
<8, (3, 4, 7)>
<9, (0, 1)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
