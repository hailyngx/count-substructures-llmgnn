Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, 6, and node 7

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern.

Based on the adjacency list provided, the nodes with exactly three neighbors are: Node 0, Node 4, and Node 8.

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
1. <0, (1, 7, 8)>
2. <4, (5, 6, 7)>
3. <8, (1, 2, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
