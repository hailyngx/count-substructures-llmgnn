Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 9
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 7

Response:
The central node of a 3-star must have degree 3 (connected to exactly 3 other nodes). Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph step-by-step:

1. Nodes with degree 3: Nodes 0, 1, 4, 6, and 7 have degree 3.
2. Check their neighbors to see if they form 3-stars:
   - Node 0: (0, 2, 4)
   - Node 1: (1, 2, 4)
   - Node 4: (4, 0, 1) and (4, 2, 9)
   - Node 6: No 3-star as its neighbors don't form a 3-star.
   - Node 7: (7, 2, 3) and (7, 2, 9) 

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are: <0, (2, 4, 1)>, <4, (0, 1, 2)>, <4, (2, 9, 4)>, <7, (2, 3, 7)>, <7, (2, 9, 7)>. 

Count of 3-stars: [5].
