Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 8

Response:
Let's look for 3-stars in the given graph:

- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 6, and 9. <0, (2, 6, 9)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, and 6. <2, (0, 1, 6)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 6, and 9. <4, (1, 6, 9)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 2, and 4. <6, (0, 2, 4)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 4, and 8. <9, (0, 4, 8)>

Therefore, there are [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
