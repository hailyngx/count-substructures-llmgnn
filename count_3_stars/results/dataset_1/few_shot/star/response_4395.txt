Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the 3-stars. 

Let's begin by listing all possible 3-star configurations using the provided adjacency information:
- (0, 1, 5)
- (1, 0, 5)
- (2, 1, 6)
- (5, 0, 1)
- (5, 1, 3)
- (1, 2, 6)
- (1, 4, 7)
- (1, 6, 2)
- (1, 8, 0)
- (1, 5, 9)

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph:
- There are 10 nodes in total, so we need to check each node for its connections to form 3-stars.
- Counting unique 3-star configurations revealed the following 3-stars: <0, (1, 5, 9)>, <1, (0, 2, 6)>, <1, (4, 6, 8)>, <5, (0, 1, 3)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
