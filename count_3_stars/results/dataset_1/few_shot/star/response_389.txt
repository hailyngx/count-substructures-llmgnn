Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star pattern, which consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's find the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<3, (1, 5, 8)>
<4, (0, 2, 6)>
<4, (1, 6, 8)>
<4, (2, 8, 6)>
<5, (1, 3, 9)>

Now we count the total number of unique 3-star patterns: [5].
