Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8

Response:
Let's find the 3-star graphs in this given graph. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we can identify the central nodes and their adjacent nodes. 

Central nodes:
- Node 0 is the central node connected to nodes 1 and 7
- Node 1 is the central node connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, 8, and 9
- Node 4 is the central node connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 7, and 8
- Node 7 is the central node connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, and 6
- Node 8 is the central node connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, and 9

Now, let's count the number of 3-star graphs.

[5]

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 7)>
<1, (0, 2, 4)>
<1, (0, 8, 9)>
<4, (1, 2, 3)>
<4, (1, 7, 8)>
