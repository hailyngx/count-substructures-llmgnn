Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 7, and node 8

Response:
Based on the given information, the 3-star graphs in the given graph are as follows:

<1, (3, 5, 8)>
<2, (6, 7, 8)>
<3, (1, 6, 7)>
<4, (5, 6, 8)>
<8, (0, 1, 2)>
<8, (0, 4, 6)>
<8, (1, 3, 6)>
<8, (2, 6, 9)>
<8, (3, 6, 8)>
<8, (4, 6, 8)>
<9, (0, 2, 8)>
<9, (7, 8, 9)>

Therefore, there are [12] 3-star graphs in the given graph.
