Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 6

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are:
<0, (4, 8, 9)>
<1, (3, 7, 2)>
<2, (7, 9, 0)>
<3, (1, 4, 7)>
<4, (0, 7, 8)>
<7, (1, 2, 5)>
<9, (0, 2, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
