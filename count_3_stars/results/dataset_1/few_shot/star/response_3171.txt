Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 7

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are: 
<0, (3, 5, 7)>
<2, (1, 5, 9)>
<5, (0, 2, 7)>
<7, (0, 5, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
