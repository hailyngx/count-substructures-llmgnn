Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 6

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph.

To form a 3-star, we need a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list the possible 3-stars:
- The 3-star centered at node 0: <0, (3, 5, 9)>
- The 3-star centered at node 3: <3, (0, 2, 5)>, <3, (0, 5, 8)>, and <3, (2, 5, 8)>
- The 3-star centered at node 8: <8, (1, 4, 7)> and <8, (3, 4, 7)>
- The 3-star centered at node 9: <9, (0, 4, 6)> and <9, (2, 4, 6)>

There are a total of 7 unique 3-stars. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7]. 

The unique 3-stars are <0, (3, 5, 9)>, <3, (0, 2, 5)>, <3, (0, 5, 8)>, <3, (2, 5, 8)>, <8, (1, 4, 7)>, <8, (3, 4, 7)>, and <9, (0, 4, 6)>.
