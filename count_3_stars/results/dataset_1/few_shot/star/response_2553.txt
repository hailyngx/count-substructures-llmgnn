Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars:

<0, (5, 8, 9)>
<2, (3, 4, 7)>
<4, (2, 3, 5)>
<6, (1, 3, 5)>
<7, (1, 2, 6)>
<9, (0, 2, 4)>

Therefore, there are a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
