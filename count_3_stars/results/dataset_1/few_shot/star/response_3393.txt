Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 7

Response:
Following the definition of a 3-star graph, we are looking for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. From the adjacency list provided, we can identify the central nodes and their respective leaves to find the 3-stars in the graph.

Here are the 3-stars found in the given graph:
<8, (0, 1, 4)>
<2, (1, 5, 7)>
<5, (1, 2, 8)>
<9, (2, 5, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
