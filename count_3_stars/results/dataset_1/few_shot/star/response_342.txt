Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 7
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 8

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0 is a center of a 3-star with leaves 1, 2, and 6. (<0, (1, 2, 6)>)
2. Node 1 is a center of a 3-star with leaves 0, 3, and 8. (<1, (0, 3, 8)>)
3. Node 2 is a center of a 3-star with leaves 0, 5, and 6. (<2, (0, 5, 6)>)
4. Node 3 is a center of a 3-star with leaves 0, 1, and 7. (<3, (0, 1, 7)>)
5. Node 5 is a center of a 3-star with leaves 0, 2, and 8. (<5, (0, 2, 8)>)
6. Node 6 is a center of a 3-star with leaves 0, 2, and 9. (<6, (0, 2, 9)>)
7. Node 8 is a center of a 3-star with leaves 1, 5, and 9. (<8, (1, 5, 9)>)
8. Node 9 is a center of a 3-star with leaves 1, 6, and 8. (<9, (1, 6, 8)>)

Count of 3-stars: [8]
