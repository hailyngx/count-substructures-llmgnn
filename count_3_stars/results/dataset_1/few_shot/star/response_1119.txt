Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes (i.e., a 3-star). Let's analyze the graph and identify the 3-stars:

1. From the adjacency list:
   - Node 0 has 3 connections: (1, 4, 9)
   - Node 7 has 5 connections: (2, 3, 6, 8, 9)

Let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (1, 4, 9)>
<7, (2, 3, 6)>
<7, (2, 3, 8)>
<7, (2, 3, 9)>
<7, (2, 6, 8)>
<7, (2, 6, 9)>
<7, (2, 8, 9)>
<7, (3, 6, 8)>
<7, (3, 6, 9)>
<7, (3, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
