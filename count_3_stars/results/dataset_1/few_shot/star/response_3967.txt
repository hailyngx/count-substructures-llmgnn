Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 0) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 8

Response:
Initially, we can identify the central nodes for the 3-stars as those nodes with exactly 3 neighbors. From the given adjacency list, nodes 3, 7, and 8 have 1 neighbor each, node 2 has 0 neighbors, and the rest have more than 3 neighbors.

Therefore, the potential central nodes are 0, 4, and 6.

Next, we can check the neighbors of each potential central node to determine if they form a 3-star structure. 

- For node 0, the neighbors are 1 and 7. Since it has exactly 2 neighbors, it cannot form a 3-star.

- For node 4, the neighbors are 1 and 9. Since it has exactly 2 neighbors, it cannot form a 3-star.

- For node 6, the neighbors are 1 and 5. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 5, and 9. Node 5 is also connected to nodes 1, 3, 6, and 9. As a result, the 3-star structure is <6, (1, 3, 5)>.

Finally, we count the number of 3-stars in the graph. 

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1], and the unique 3-star found is <6, (1, 3, 5)>.
