Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the 3-stars in the graph.

Observations:
- A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.
- For each node in the graph, we will check if it forms a 3-star with its neighbors.

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (3, 6, 8)>
<2, (1, 3, 5)>
<3, (0, 2, 5)>
<3, (6, 7, 9)>
<7, (1, 3, 4)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
