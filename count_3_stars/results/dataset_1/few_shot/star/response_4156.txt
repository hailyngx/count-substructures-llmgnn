Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

By examining the graph and adjacency list provided, we can identify the following 3-star configurations:
<0, (2, 5, 6)>
<0, (2, 6, 7)>
<2, (0, 4, 3)>
<6, (0, 8, 9)>
<7, (0, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5]. 
Here are the unique 3-stars:
<0, (2, 5, 6)>
<2, (0, 4, 3)>
<6, (0, 8, 9)>
<7, (0, 8, 9)>
