Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify sets of nodes where one node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<0, (2, 3, 5)>
<0, (2, 3, 7)>
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<0, (3, 4, 7)>
<0, (3, 5, 7)>
<1, (3, 4, 8)>
<3, (0, 2, 7)>
<3, (0, 4, 8)>
<3, (1, 2, 7)>
<3, (1, 4, 8)>
<3, (2, 0, 7)>
<3, (2, 7, 9)>
<3, (4, 0, 8)>
<4, (0, 1, 3)>

Count of 3-stars: [15]
Unique 3-stars:
<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<0, (2, 3, 5)>
<0, (2, 3, 7)>
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<0, (3, 4, 7)>
<0, (3, 5, 7)>
<1, (3, 4, 8)>
<3, (0, 2, 7)>
<3, (0, 4, 8)>
<3, (1, 2, 7)>
<3, (1, 4, 8)>
<3, (2, 0, 7)>
<3, (2, 7, 9)>
<3, (4, 0, 8)>
<4, (0, 1, 3)>
