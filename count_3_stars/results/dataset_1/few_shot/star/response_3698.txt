Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 8

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star configurations in the given graph:

<0, (5, 6, 7)>
<0, (5, 6, 8)>
<0, (5, 7, 8)>
<0, (6, 7, 8)>
<2, (5, 6, 8)>
<7, (8, 9, 0)>
<7, (8, 9, 7)>
<7, (8, 9, 5)>
<8, (7, 9, 8)>
<8, (7, 9, 9)>

Count of 3-star configurations: [10]
