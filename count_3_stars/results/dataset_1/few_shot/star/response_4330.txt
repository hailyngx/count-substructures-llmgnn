Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 7
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 1

Response:
The center of a 3-star must have degree 3 because it is connected to three other nodes. 
Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph.

1. For node 0: <0, (4, 5, 6)> 
2. For node 5: <5, (0, 4, 6)> 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
The unique 3-stars found are: <<0, (4, 5, 6)>, <5, (0, 4, 6)>].
