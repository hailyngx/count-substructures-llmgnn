Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 7

Response:
We will look for 3-stars by examining each node in the graph to see if it is the center of a valid 3-star. Here are the 3-stars found in the given graph:

[6]

<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<0, (4, 6, 8)>
<0, (6, 7, 9)>
<3, (4, 7, 9)>
<9, (0, 3, 7)>
