Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

The 3-stars in this graph are:
<0, (1, 7, 8)>
<1, (0, 4, 5)>
<2, (3, 6, -)>
<3, (2, 4, -)>
<4, (1, 3, 5)>
<5, (1, 4, 6)>
<6, (2, 5, -)>
<7, (0, 8, 9)>
<8, (1, 4, 7)>
<9, (7, 8, -)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
