Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 5
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 3

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a star pattern.

Looking at the adjacency list provided:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, and 4: <0, (1, 3, 4)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 2, and 7: <1, (0, 2, 7)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 7, and 9: <3, (0, 7, 9)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 4, and 7: <5, (2, 4, 7)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, and 5: <7, (1, 3, 5)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 1 and 3: <9, (1, 3)>

Therefore, there are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
The final answer is [6].
