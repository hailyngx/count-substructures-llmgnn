Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars:

<0, (5, 6, 9)>
<1, (7, 2, 3)>
<2, (3, 5, 7)>
<3, (2, 4, 7)>
<4, (3, 8, 2)>
<5, (0, 2, 7)>
<6, (0, 7, 5)>
<7, (1, 2, 3)>
<8, (2, 4, 8)>
<9, (0, 8, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [10].
