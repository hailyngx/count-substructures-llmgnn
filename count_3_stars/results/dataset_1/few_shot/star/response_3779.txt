Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 3
