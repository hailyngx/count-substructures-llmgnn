Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, and node 8

Response:
At first, we can determine the central node for each potential 3-star in the graph. 
Then, we can examine which nodes are connected to this central node in sets of three, satisfying the conditions for a 3-star.
Finally, we count the number of unique 3-stars in the graph. 

Let's follow through these steps:

### Step 1: Identify Central Nodes
The possible central nodes based on the given edges are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

### Step 2: Find 3-Star Configurations
After examining the adjacency list for each central node, we find the following 3-stars:
- <0, (4, 7)>
- <1, (2, 4)>
- <2, (1, 5)>
- <3, (4, 8)>
- <4, (0, 1, 3)>
- <5, (2, 9)>
- <6, (7, 8, 9)>
- <7, (0, 6, 8)>
- <8, (3, 6, 9)>
- <9, (4, 5, 6)>

### Step 3: Count Unique 3-Stars
Now, let's determine the total number of unique 3-stars: [9]

Therefore, the final answer is [9].
