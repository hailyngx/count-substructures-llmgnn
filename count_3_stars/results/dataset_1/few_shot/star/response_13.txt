Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 8

Response:
The 3-star graphs can be found by identifying nodes that have exactly 3 edges. Let's identify them first:

- Node 0: connected to 3 other nodes (4, 5, 7)
- Node 1: connected to 2 other nodes (8, 9)
- Node 2: connected to 3 other nodes (3, 4, 6)
- Node 4: connected to 3 other nodes (0, 2, 5)
- Node 5: connected to 3 other nodes (0, 4, 6)
- Node 6: connected to 3 other nodes (2, 5, 7)
- Node 7: connected to 2 other nodes (0, 3)
- Node 8: connected to 2 other nodes (1, 9)
- Node 9: connected to 2 other nodes (1, 8)

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:

<0, (4, 5, 7)>
<2, (3, 4, 6)>
<4, (0, 2, 5)>
<5, (0, 4, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
