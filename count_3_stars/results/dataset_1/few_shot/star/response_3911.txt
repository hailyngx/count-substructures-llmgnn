Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all 3-stars by identifying the central node and the three connected nodes. Let's go step by step.

Step 1: Identify the nodes with exactly three neighbors.

From the adjacency list:
- Node 4 has neighbors: 0, 5, 9
- Node 6 has neighbors: 0, 1, 2
- Node 7 has neighbors: 0, 2, 5
- Node 8 has neighbors: 0, 3, 5

Step 2: Enumerate the 3-stars.

<4, (0, 5, 9)>
<6, (0, 1, 2)>
<7, (0, 2, 5)>
<8, (0, 3, 5)>

Step 3: Find the total number of unique 3-stars.
There are 4 unique 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
