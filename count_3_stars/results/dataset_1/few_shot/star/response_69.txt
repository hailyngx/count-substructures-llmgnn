Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 2) (6, 8) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

```
    0 --- 2
   /|\    | \
  3 |     |  5
   \|     | /
    4     7
         / \
        8   6
        |
        9
```

To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify all possible 3-stars. Remember that a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's go step by step to find all the 3-stars:

1. Node 0:
   - <0, (2, 3, 4)> 

2. Node 1:
   - <1, (4, 9, )>

3. Node 2:
   - <2, (0, 5, 7)>
   - <2, (0, 7, 8)>
   - <2, (0, 5, 8)>
   - <2, (5, 7, 8)>

4. Node 3:
   - <3, (0, 4, )>

5. Node 4:
   - <4, (1, 3, )>

6. Node 5:
   - <5, (2, , )>

7. Node 6:
   - <6, (8, , )>

8. Node 7:
   - <7, (2, , )>

9. Node 8:
   - <8, (2, 6, )>

10. Node 9:
   - <9, (1, , )>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
