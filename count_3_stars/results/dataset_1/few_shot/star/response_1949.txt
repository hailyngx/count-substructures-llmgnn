Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a 3-star pattern.

Looking at the adjacency list provided, we can identify the 3-stars as follows:

<0, (3, 4, 5)>  
<0, (3, 5, 6)>  
<0, (3, 5, 9)>  
<0, (4, 2, 6)>  
<0, (4, 7, 9)>  
<1, (5, 0, 8)>  
<2, (4, 6, 9)>  
<3, (0, 4, 7)>  
<4, (0, 2, 6)>  
<5, (0, 1, 8)>  
<7, (3, 4, 9)>  
<9, (0, 7, 8)>

Counting the number of 3-stars gives us a total of [12].
