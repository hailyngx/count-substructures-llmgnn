Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 8
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 8

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

1. For node 0: 
    - Possible 3-stars: <0, (5, 8)>
    
2. For node 2: 
    - Possible 3-stars: <2, (3, 4)>

3. For node 3: 
    - Possible 3-stars: <3, (2, 5)>, <3, (5, 8)>

4. For node 5: 
    - Possible 3-stars: <5, (0, 3)>

5. For node 8: 
    - Possible 3-stars: <8, (0, 3)>, <8, (3, 6)>, <8, (8, 9)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
