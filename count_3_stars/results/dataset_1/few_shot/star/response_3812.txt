Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can identify the central node in each 3-star and then find the number of distinct sets of three leaves connected to that central node. 

Based on the given information, we can identify the following 3-stars:

<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<1, (0, 5, 9)>
<3, (6, 8, 9)>
<4, (5, 6, 7)>
<5, (0, 1, 4)>
<6, (3, 4, 8)>
<7, (0, 4, 9)>
<8, (3, 4, 6)>
<9, (1, 3, 6)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we find there are 9 3-stars in total.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
