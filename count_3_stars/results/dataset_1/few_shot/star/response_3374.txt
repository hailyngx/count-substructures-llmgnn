Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes in a star-like pattern. Since each 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we will examine each node to determine if it forms a 3-star.

For a node to be the central node of a 3-star, it must have exactly three neighbors. We will list the unique 3-stars found.

Let's start by listing the 3-stars:

<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<2, (0, 9, 4)>
<3, (1, 9, 9)>
<4, (0, 8, 9)>
<5, (6, 9, 9)>
<6, (0, 5, 9)>
<9, (2, 3, 4)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars gives us the final answer:
[7]
