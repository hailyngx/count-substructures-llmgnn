Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 7

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (1, 6, 7)>
2. <0, (1, 6, 9)>
3. <0, (1, 7, 9)>
4. <1, (0, 3, 5)>
5. <1, (0, 3, 8)>
6. <1, (0, 5, 8)>
7. <3, (1, 2, 5)>
8. <3, (1, 7, 5)>
9. <3, (2, 7, 5)>
10. <5, (1, 3, 8)>
11. <5, (3, 7, 8)>
12. <5, (1, 8, 3)>
13. <6, (0, 4, 7)>
14. <7, (0, 3, 9)>
15. <7, (0, 6, 9)>
16. <7, (3, 6, 9)>
17. <8, (1, 2, 5)>
18. <8, (1, 5, 3)>
19. <8, (2, 3, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [19].
