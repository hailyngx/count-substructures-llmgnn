Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 7) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 7
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify the nodes that have exactly three neighbors, as these nodes can potentially be centers of 3-stars.

The nodes with exactly three neighbors are:
- Node 3
- Node 8

Now, let's check the possible 3-stars centered at these nodes:

For Node 3:
Since Node 3 has only one neighbor, it cannot be the center of a 3-star.

For Node 8:
Since Node 8 has only one neighbor, it also cannot be the center of a 3-star.

Therefore, there are no 3-stars in the given graph.

Final answer: [0]
