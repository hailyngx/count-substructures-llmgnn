Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 6

Response:
Let's find the 3-star subgraphs in the given graph:

There are 5 unique 3-stars:
<1, (3, 5, 6)>
<3, (1, 5, 7)>
<5, (1, 3, 6)>
<6, (1, 5, 9)>
<7, (1, 3, 8)>
