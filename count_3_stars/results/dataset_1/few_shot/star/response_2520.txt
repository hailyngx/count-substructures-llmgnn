Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 4, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the unique 3-stars.

The unique 3-stars in the graph are:
<0, (2, 4, 8)>
<0, (2, 6, 9)>
<0, (3, 4, 8)>
<0, (5, 6, 9)>
<2, (0, 3, 5)>
<2, (0, 7, 9)>
<3, (0, 2, 4)>
<4, (0, 3, 6)>
<6, (0, 4, 7)>
<8, (0, 4, 7)>
<9, (0, 5, 6)>

Count of 3-stars = [11]
