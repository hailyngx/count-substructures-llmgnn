Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to find all instances of the specific pattern described (a central node connected to exactly three other nodes). Let's go through the nodes and their connections to identify the 3-stars:

1. For Node 0:
   - Possible 3-stars: 
     <0, (1, 2, 5)>, <0, (1, 2, 8)>

2. For Node 1:
   - Possible 3-star: 
     <1, (0, 2, 8)>

3. For Node 2:
   - Possible 3-star: 
     <2, (0, 1, 8)>

No other nodes have the required connections to form a 3-star pattern. 
Therefore, the final answer is [3], as there are three unique 3-stars in the given graph: <0, (1, 2, 5)>, <0, (1, 2, 8)>, <1, (0, 2, 8)>.
