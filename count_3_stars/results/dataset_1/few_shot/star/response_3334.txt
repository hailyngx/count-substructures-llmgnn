Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8)

Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern. Let's identify the 3-stars step by step:

1. Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 5, and 7. Thus, we have <2, (0, 5, 7)>.

2. Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 3, and 9. Thus, we have <4, (2, 3, 9)>.

3. Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 3, and 9. Thus, we have <8, (0, 3, 9)>.

By counting all the unique 3-stars identified above, we can see that there are a total of [3] 3-stars in the given graph.
