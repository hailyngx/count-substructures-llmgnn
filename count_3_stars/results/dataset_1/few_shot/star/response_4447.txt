Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify the 3-stars present in this graph.

From the given edge list and adjacency lists, we can identify the following unique 3-stars:
1. <0, (1, 2, 8)>
2. <1, (0, 6, 9)>
3. <2, (0, 3, 6)>
4. <3, (2, 6, 8)>
5. <6, (2, 5, 8)>
6. <8, (0, 3, 5)>
7. <9, (1, 6, 0)>

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
