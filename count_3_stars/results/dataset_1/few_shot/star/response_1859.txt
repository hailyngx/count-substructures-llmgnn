Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern. 

Following the provided adjacency list, we can see that the 3-star patterns exist at the following nodes:
1. <0, (2, 4, 7)>
2. <1, (2, 3, 5)>
3. <2, (0, 1, 4)>
4. <3, (1, 4, 8)>
5. <4, (0, 2, 5)>
6. <5, (1, 4, 6)>
7. <6, (2, 5, 9)>
8. <7, (0, 8)>
9. <8, (0, 1, 3)>
10. <9, (6)>

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
