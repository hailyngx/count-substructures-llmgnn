Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

We can start by looking at each node and its neighbors. If a node has three neighbors, we can form a 3-star with that node as the center.

In this graph, the nodes with three neighbors are:
- Node 0: (0, 3), (0, 4), and (0, 7)
- Node 1: (1, 4), (1, 8), and (1, 9)
- Node 2: (2, 3), (2, 5), and (2, 7)
- Node 3: (3, 0), (3, 2), and (3, 6)
- Node 4: (4, 0), (4, 1), and (4, 5)
- Node 7: (7, 0), (7, 2), and (7, 8)

Now, let's count the unique 3-stars formed by these nodes:
- <0, (3, 4, 7)>
- <1, (4, 8, 9)>
- <2, (3, 5, 7)>
- <3, (0, 2, 6)>
- <4, (0, 1, 5)>
- <7, (0, 2, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
