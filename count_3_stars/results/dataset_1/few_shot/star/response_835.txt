Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star. Let's list the unique 3-stars and count them:

<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<0, (3, 8, 6)>
<0, (5, 6, 8)>
<2, (4, 7, 9)>
<4, (2, 6, 8)>
<4, (6, 8, 9)>
<6, (0, 3, 8)>
<6, (4, 7, 8)>
<8, (0, 4, 9)>
<8, (4, 6, 9)>
