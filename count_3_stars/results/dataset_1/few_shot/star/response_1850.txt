Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 4) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 7

Response:
Let's first identify the central nodes and their adjacent nodes:

- Central nodes with 3 neighbors: 0, 6, 7, 9

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (1, 7, 9)>
<6, (1, 3, 4)>
<7, (0, 5, 9)>
<9, (0, 6, 7)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we have a total of [4].
