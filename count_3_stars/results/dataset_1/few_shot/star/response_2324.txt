Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

From the adjacency list provided, we can identify the following nodes that form 3-stars:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 5.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 5, 7, and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 5.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 8, 6, and 0.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

<'0', (1, 4, 5)>
<'3', (5, 7, 9)>
<'6', (1, 2, 5)>
<'9', (8, 6, 0)>
