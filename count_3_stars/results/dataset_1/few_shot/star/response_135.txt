Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 5
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 3

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- 3-star centered at node 0: <0, (1, 3, 9)>
- 3-star centered at node 1: <1, (0, 5, 9)>
- 3-star centered at node 5: <5, (1, 4, 8)>
- 3-star centered at node 9: <9, (1, 2, 3)>
