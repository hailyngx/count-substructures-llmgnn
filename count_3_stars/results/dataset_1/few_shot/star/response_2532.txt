Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star in the graph. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.
Let's list the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (1, 2, 6)>
<0, (1, 2, 8)>
<0, (1, 2, 9)>
<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<0, (2, 4, 8)>
<0, (2, 4, 9)>
<4, (2, 7, 8)>
<4, (2, 7, 9)>
<6, (0, 2, 5)>
<8, (0, 4, 7)>
