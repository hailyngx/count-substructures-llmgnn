Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 7

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- <1, (0, 2, 8)>
- <2, (1, 3, 6)>
- <3, (0, 2, 4)>
- <5, (4, 6, 8)>
- <6, (2, 5, 9)>
- <8, (1, 4, 5)>
- <9, (5, 6, 7)>

Counting these unique 3-stars, we find a total of [7].
