Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1

Response:
Ignoring the directions of edges, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
1. From node 0: <0, (2, 5, 6)>
2. From node 2: <2, (0, 5, 3)>
3. From node 5: <5, (0, 2, 4)>
4. From node 6: <6, (0, 8, 7)>
5. From node 8: <8, (0, 6, 7)>

Counting all unique 3-stars, we find 5 in total.  
Therefore, the final answer is [5].
