Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Looking at the given edges and adjacency list, we can identify the 3-stars as follows:
<0, (2, 3, 9)>
<1, (3, 5, 6)>
<2, (0, 5, 7)>
<3, (0, 1, 7)>
<7, (2, 3, 8)>
<8, (1, 2, 4)>
<9, (0, 6, 7)>

Count: [7]
