Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern. A 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the unique 3-stars in the graph:

1. <0, (1, 8, 4)>
2. <1, (0, 6, 2)>
3. <2, (3, 4, 5)>
4. <3, (2, 4, 9)>
5. <4, (2, 3, 5)>
6. <5, (2, 4, 6)>
7. <6, (1, 5, 7)>
8. <7, (5, 6, 8)>
9. <8, (0, 4, 6)>
10. <9, (2, 7, 8)>

Therefore, there are a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
