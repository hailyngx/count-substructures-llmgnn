Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for each node that has exactly three neighbors and identify the 3-stars centered at those nodes.

From the given adjacency list, we can see that the nodes with exactly three neighbors are nodes 1, 2, 4, and 6.

Let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<1, (2, 3, 7)>
<2, (1, 6, 7)>
<4, (3, 7, 8)>
<6, (2, 5, 0)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we get a total of [4].
