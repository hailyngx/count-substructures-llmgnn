Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 6
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 9
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will look for each node that has exactly three neighbors connected to it. 

In this case, we find the following 3-stars: 
<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<1, (2, 6, 7)>
<2, (0, 1, 4)>
<4, (0, 2, 6)>
<6, (0, 1, 4)>
<7, (0, 1, 9)>
<9, (6, 7, not connected)>

The number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
