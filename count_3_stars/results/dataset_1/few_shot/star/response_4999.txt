Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 5, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes in the graph. These nodes will serve as the centers of the 3-stars.

From the adjacency list provided, we can identify the following nodes as potential centers of 3-stars:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 5.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 6.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 5.

Let's calculate the number of unique 3-stars in this graph. 
[4] 

Here are the unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 5, 9)>
<1, (0, 4, 9)>
<4, (1, 3, 5)>
<5, (0, 4, 6)>
