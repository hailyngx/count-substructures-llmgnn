Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 8) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars present. Remember that a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

After examining the graph, we find the following 3-stars:
<1, (8, 9, x)>
<2, (0, 5, 8)>
<4, (3, 8, 9)>

Now we need to count the number of times these unique 3-stars appear. Let's count them:
<1, (8, 9, x)> appears once
<2, (0, 5, 8)> appears once
<4, (3, 8, 9)> appears once

Therefore, there are [3] 3-stars in the given graph.
