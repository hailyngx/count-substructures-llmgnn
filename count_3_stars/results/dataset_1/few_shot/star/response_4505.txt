Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 7
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 5, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list the 3-stars below:

<[0, 2, 1], (8, 7, 9)>
<[0, 7, 8], (2, 9, 0)>
<[0, 8, 9], (2, 7, 1)>
<[1, 2, 9], (0, 7, 5)>
<[4, 2, 5], (6, 0, 9)>
<[4, 5, 6], (2, 9, 4)>
<[4, 6, 2], (5, 0, 7)>
<[5, 4, 9], (6, 2, 1)>
<[5, 9, 1], (4, 2, 7)>
<[6, 4, 2], (5, 0, 7)>
<[7, 0, 9], (8, 2, 1)>
<[7, 9, 8], (0, 2, 5)>
<[8, 0, 9], (7, 2, 1)>
<[9, 1, 2], (8, 7, 5)>
<[9, 5, 4], (1, 2, 6)>
<[9, 7, 8], (5, 1, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [16].
