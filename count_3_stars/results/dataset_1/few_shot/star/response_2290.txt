Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 5, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star-like formation.

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (2, 5, 9)>
<2, (4, 5, 9)>
<4, (2, 6, 9)>
<5, (0, 2, 9)>
<6, (4)>
<7, (9)>
<8, (9)>

Count of 3-stars found: [7]
