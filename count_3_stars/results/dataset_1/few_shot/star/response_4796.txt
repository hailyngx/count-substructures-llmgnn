Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 0) (8, 4) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 0
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 1

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify the nodes that form 3-stars centered at them.

Based on the given information, the nodes that can serve as the center of a 3-star are: 1 and 5.

Let's analyze the 3-stars around each potential center:

1. For node 1:
    - Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 5, and 9.
    - Possible 3-stars around node 1: <1, (2, 4, 5)>, <1, (2, 4, 9)>, <1, (2, 5, 9)>, <1, (4, 5, 9)>
   
2. For node 5:
    - Node 5 is connected to nodes 0 and 1.
    - Possible 3-stars around node 5: <5, (0, 1, 6)>

Counting the unique 3-stars we identified:
- <1, (2, 4, 5)>
- <1, (2, 4, 9)>
- <1, (2, 5, 9)>
- <1, (4, 5, 9)>
- <5, (0, 1, 6)>

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
