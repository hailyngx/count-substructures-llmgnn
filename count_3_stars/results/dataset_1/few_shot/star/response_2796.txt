Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 9) (3, 1) (4, 0) (5, 8) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 7

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are as follows:
<1, (3, 9, 0)>
<1, (9, 6, 3)>
<6, (8, 9, 1)>
<9, (1, 6, 7)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
