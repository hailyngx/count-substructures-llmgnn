Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern. 

Looking at the provided edges and adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (3, 6, 7)>
<1, (4, 6, 8)>
<3, (0, 2, 4)>
<3, (0, 4, 8)>
<4, (1, 3, 8)>
<8, (1, 3, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
