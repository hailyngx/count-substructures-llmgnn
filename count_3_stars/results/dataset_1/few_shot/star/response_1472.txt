Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes (forming a 3-star graph) and count those occurrences.

Considering the adjacency list provided, we find the following 3-stars:
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<1, (4, 7, 8)>
<2, (0, 5, 8)>
<3, (4, 6, 7)>
<4, (0, 1, 9)>
<5, (0, 2, 8)>
<6, (3, 7, 9)>
<7, (1, 3, 6)>
<8, (0, 1, 5)>
<9, (4, 6, -)>

There are a total of [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
