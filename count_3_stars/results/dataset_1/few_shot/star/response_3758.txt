Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 5, and node 7

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars in the given graph. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 
From the adjacency list, we can identify the nodes with three connections as potential central nodes of 3-stars: 
Nodes 0, 5, and 7.

Next, let's find the unique 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (2, 3, 6)>
<0, (2, 3, 7)>
<0, (3, 6, 7)>
<0, (5, 6, 7)>
<5, (1, 4, 9)>
<5, (4, 9, 7)>
<7, (6, 0, 9)>

Counting all the unique 3-stars, we get a total of [7].
