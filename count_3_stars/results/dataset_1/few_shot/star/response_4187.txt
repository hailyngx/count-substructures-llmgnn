Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list the 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (2, 5, 8)>
<0, (2, 5, 9)>
<0, (5, 8, 9)>
<1, (5, 6, 3)>
<2, (0, 5, 7)>
<2, (5, 7, 4)>
<8, (0, 7, 9)>

Considering all the unique 3-stars listed above, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
