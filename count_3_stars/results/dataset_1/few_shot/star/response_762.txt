Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:
[4]

There is only one 3-star in this graph and it is <4, (2, 6, 8)>. Thus, the answer is [1].
