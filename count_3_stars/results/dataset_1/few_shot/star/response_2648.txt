Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 6
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes forming a 3-star pattern.

In this graph, only nodes 0, 3, and 6 have degree 3, which means they are the only candidates to be the center of a 3-star.

Let's go through each of these candidate nodes and check if they are indeed the center of a 3-star:

1. Node 0:
   - Node 0 is connected to nodes 2 and 4.
   - There is no 3-star centered at node 0 since it is not connected to a third node.

2. Node 3:
   - Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 6, and 7.
   - <3, (2, 4, 6)> is a 3-star centered at node 3.

3. Node 6:
   - Node 6 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 8, and 9.
   - <6, (3, 4, 8)> is a 3-star centered at node 6.

Therefore, there are 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph: <3, (2, 4, 6)> and <6, (3, 4, 8)>.

So, the final answer is [2].
