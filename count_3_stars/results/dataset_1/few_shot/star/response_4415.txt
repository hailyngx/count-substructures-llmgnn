Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 8

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 5 - <0, (1, 2, 5)>
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2 - <1, (0, 2, 9)>
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 4 - <2, (0, 1, 9)>
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 6 - <4, (2, 3, 6)>
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 6 - <5, (0, 6, 7)>
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 8 - <6, (4, 5, 8)>
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 4, 6, 9 - <8, (4, 6, 9)>
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2 - <9, (0, 1, 8)>

Count of 3-stars: [7]
