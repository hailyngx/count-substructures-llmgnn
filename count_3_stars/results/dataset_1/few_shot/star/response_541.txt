Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes (leaves) by edges.

Looking at the adjacency list provided:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with leaves 4, 5, and 8
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with leaves 4, 6, and 8
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with leaves 4, 6, and 9
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with leaves 4, 8, and 9
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with leaves 0, 1, and 2
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with leaves 0, 6, and 8
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with leaves 1, 2, and 4
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with leaves 0, 1, and 3
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with leaves 2, 3, and 8

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in this graph are:
<0, (4, 5, 8)>
<1, (4, 6, 8)>
<2, (4, 6, 9)>
<3, (4, 8, 9)>
<4, (0, 1, 2)>
<5, (0, 6, 8)>
<6, (1, 2, 4)>
<8, (0, 1, 3)>
<9, (2, 3, 8)>

Count of 3-stars: [9]
