Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (6, 4) (7, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 6
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that serves as the center of a 3-star. A 3-star is formed by the center node and exactly three connected nodes.

Let's list down all the unique 3-stars we can find in this graph:

<1, (4, 7, 2)>
<2, (3, 8, 4)>
<3, (2, 9, 8)>
<4, (1, 2, 6)>
<8, (2, 9, 9)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars in the graph: [5]
