Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (2, 0) (2, 8) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 8

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

The 3-stars in the given graph are as follows:
<0, (2, 6, 7)>
<2, (0, 8, 7)>
<7, (0, 5, 6)>
<8, (2, 7, 9)>

Count of 3-stars: [4]
