Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern.

Looking at the adjacency list for each node, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (1, 7, 9)>
<1, (0, 2, 8)>
<2, (1, 3, 9)>
<3, (1, 2, 7)>
<4, (1, 2, 8)>
<7, (0, 1, 9)>
<8, (1, 2, 4)>
<9, (0, 2, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
