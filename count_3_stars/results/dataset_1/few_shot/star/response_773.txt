Node 6 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 5, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible 3-stars. Remember, a 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Here are the steps to find the number of 3-stars:
1. Identify all nodes that have exactly 3 neighbors.
2. For each of these nodes, check if it forms a 3-star.

Let's identify the nodes that have exactly 3 neighbors:
- Node 1 (connected to 0, 8, 9)
- Node 2 (connected to 0, 8)
- Node 3 (connected to 7, 9)
- Node 5 (connected to 7, 9)
- Node 6 (connected to 7, 9)

Now, let's check if each of these nodes form a 3-star:

- Node 1: <1, (0, 8, 9)>
- Node 2: <2, (0, 8, x)>
- Node 3: <3, (7, 9, x)>
- Node 5: <5, (7, 9, x)>
- Node 6: <6, (7, 9, x)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
