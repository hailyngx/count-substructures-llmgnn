Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look at each node and its neighbors to see if it forms a 3-star. 

Looking at the adjacency list of each node:

- Node 0 forms a 3-star with leaves 6, 8, and 9: <0, (6, 8, 9)>
- Node 1 does not form a 3-star as it has only 2 neighbors.
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with leaves 3, 4, and 6: <2, (3, 4, 6)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with leaves 2, 7, and 8: <3, (2, 7, 8)>
- Node 4 does not form a 3-star as it has only 2 neighbors.
- Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with leaves 0, 1, and 2: <6, (0, 1, 2)>
- Node 7 does not form a 3-star as it has only 2 neighbors.
- Node 8 does not form a 3-star as it has only 2 neighbors.
- Node 9 does not form a 3-star as it has only 1 neighbor.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (6, 8, 9)>, <2, (3, 4, 6)>, and <3, (2, 7, 8)>.
