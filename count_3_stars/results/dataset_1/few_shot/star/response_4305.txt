Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (3, 1) (4, 6) (5, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 8

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are:
<0, (5, 7, 8)>
<8, (0, 9, 7)>
