Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern. 

Let's analyze each node in the graph:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 6, and 7. (1 3-star)
- Node 1 is connected to node 4. (no 3-star)
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 4. (1 3-star)
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 6. (1 3-star)
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1 and 2. (no 3-star)
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 3, 8, and 9. (1 3-star)
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 8. (no 3-star)
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0 and 8. (no 3-star)
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 9. (1 3-star)
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 8. (no 3-star)

Therefore, there are a total of [3] 3-stars in the given graph.

<0, (2, 6, 7)>
<2, (0, 3, 4)>
<3, (2, 5, 6)>
<5, (3, 8, 9)>
<8, (5, 6, 9)>
