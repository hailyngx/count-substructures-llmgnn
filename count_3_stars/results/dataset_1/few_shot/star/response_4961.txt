Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 9) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of nodes where one node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a star pattern. 

Let's list out the 3-stars in this graph: 
<0, (3, 9)>
<1, (2, 9)>
<3, (0, 7, 9)>
<7, (3, 6, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 3)>
