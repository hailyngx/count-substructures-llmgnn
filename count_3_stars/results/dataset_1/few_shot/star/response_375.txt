Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 3

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all the occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern.

First, let's list down all the 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (4, 6, 1)>
<1, (4, 6, 0)>
<1, (6, 8, 3)>
<1, (7, 4, 0)>
<1, (8, 6, 3)>
<2, (3, 6, 7)>
<2, (6, 9, 3)>
<2, (7, 3, 6)>
<3, (2, 6, 9)>
<3, (4, 6, 0)>
<3, (6, 8, 1)>
<4, (0, 1, 7)>
<4, (1, 3, 0)>
<4, (3, 7, 1)>
<6, (0, 1, 8)>
<6, (1, 2, 3)>
<6, (2, 7, 3)>
<8, (1, 6, 3)>
<8, (3, 6, 1)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars: [19].
