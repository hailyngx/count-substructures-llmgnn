Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the 3-stars present. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Looking at the adjacency list for each node, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. <0, (1, 3, 6)>
2. <0, (1, 6, 8)>
3. <2, (1, 5, 6)>
4. <2, (5, 6, 9)>
5. <5, (2, 3, 4)>
6. <5, (2, 4, 6)>
7. <5, (3, 4, 6)>
8. <6, (0, 2, 4)>
9. <6, (0, 2, 5)>
10. <6, (2, 4, 5)>
11. <9, (2, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [11].
