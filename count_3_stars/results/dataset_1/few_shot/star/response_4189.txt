Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. These instances form 3-stars.

Looking at the adjacency list provided, we can see that the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes are:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 6, and 9
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 8, and 9
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 8
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 9

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars in this graph:

1. Involving Node 0:
<0, (2, 3, 6)>
<0, (2, 3, 9)>

2. Involving Node 2:
<2, (0, 3, 8)>
<2, (0, 3, 9)>

3. Involving Node 6:
<6, (0, 1, 8)>

4. Involving Node 7:
<7, (1, 5, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
