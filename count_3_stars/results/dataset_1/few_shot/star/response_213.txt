Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern.

Here are the 3-stars in the graph:
