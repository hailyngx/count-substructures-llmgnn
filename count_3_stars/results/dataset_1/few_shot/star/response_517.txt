Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 5

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to count the number of times a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Central node: 0, Leaves: 1, 3, 5
2. Central node: 1, Leaves: 0, 7, 8
3. Central node: 3, Leaves: 0, 2, 4
4. Central node: 5, Leaves: 0, 6, 7

There are no other 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

Unique 3-stars: 
<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<1, (0, 7, 8)>
<3, (0, 2, 4)>
<5, (0, 6, 7)>
