Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that have exactly three neighbors and form a 3-star configuration with those neighbors.

Upon examining the graph, we can identify the following 3-stars: 
<1, (8, 9, 0)>
<2, (3, 4, 5)>
<3, (2, 7, 6)>
<4, (2, 9, 0)>
<5, (2, 8, 0)>
<7, (2, 3, 9)>
<8, (1, 5, 0)>
<9, (1, 4, 7)>

Counting these unique 3-stars, we find that there are a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
