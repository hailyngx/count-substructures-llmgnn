Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that acts as the center of a 3-star. 

For each node, determine the number of 3-stars that can be formed with that node as the center:

Node 0: (0, 1, 6), (0, 2, 3), (0, 3, 6), (0, 6, 9) -> Total: 4
Node 1: (1, 0, 6) -> Total: 1
Node 2: (2, 0, 3), (2, 3, 8), (2, 8, 6) -> Total: 3
Node 3: (3, 0, 2), (3, 2, 8), (3, 5, 9), (3, 6, 0) -> Total: 4
Node 4: (4, 7, 9) -> Total: 1
Node 5: (5, 3, 9), (5, 8, 2), (5, 9, 4) -> Total: 3
Node 6: (6, 0, 3), (6, 1, 0), (6, 3, 2), (6, 8, 5) -> Total: 4
Node 7: (7, 4, 9) -> Total: 1
Node 8: (8, 2, 3), (8, 3, 5), (8, 5, 9), (8, 6, 0) -> Total: 4
Node 9: (9, 0, 4), (9, 4, 5), (9, 5, 3) -> Total: 3

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [27].
  
Unique 3-stars: 
<0, (1, 6, 3)>, <0, (2, 3, 6)>, <0, (3, 6, 9)>, <1, (0, 6, 3)>, <2, (0, 3, 8)>, <2, (3, 8, 6)>, <3, (0, 2, 8)>, <3, (5, 9, 3)>, <3, (6, 0, 2)>, <4, (7, 9, 5)>, <5, (3, 9, 5)>, <5, (8, 2, 5)>, <6, (0, 3, 2)>, <6, (1, 0, 3)>, <6, (3, 8, 5)>, <7, (4, 9, 5)>, <8, (2, 3, 8)>, <8, (3, 5, 9)>, <8, (5, 9, 6)>, <8, (6, 0, 3)>, <9, (0, 4, 5)>, <9, (4, 5, 3)>, <9, (5, 3, 9)>
