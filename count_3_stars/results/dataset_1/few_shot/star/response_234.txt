Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 8

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0: 
   Possible 3-star centers: 0  
   Unique 3-stars: <0, (4, 7, 8)>

2. Node 1: 
   Possible 3-star centers: 1  
   Unique 3-stars: <1, (6, 9, 0)>

3. Node 2: 
   Possible 3-star centers: 2 
   Unique 3-stars: <2, (4, 0, 0)>

4. Node 3: 
   Possible 3-star centers: 3 
   Unique 3-stars: <3, (5, 8, 8)>

5. Node 4: 
   Possible 3-star centers: 4  
   Unique 3-stars: <4, (0, 2, 0)>

6. Node 5: 
   Possible 3-star centers: 5  
   Unique 3-stars: <5, (3, 8, 8)>

7. Node 6: 
   Possible 3-star centers: 6  
   Unique 3-stars: <6, (1, 9, 9)>

8. Node 7: 
   Possible 3-star centers: 7  
   Unique 3-stars: <7, (0, 9, 9)>

9. Node 8: 
   Possible 3-star centers: 8  
   Unique 3-stars: <8, (0, 5, 9)>

10. Node 9: 
    Possible 3-star centers: 9  
    Unique 3-stars: <9, (1, 7, 8)>

Count of 3-stars in the graph: [10]
