Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, and node 7

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

- For each node, check if it is connected to exactly three other nodes.
- If it is, then we have found a 3-star with that node as the center and the three connected nodes as the leaves.

The 3-stars in the given graph are:

<0, (4, 6, 9)>
<1, (3, 5, 7)>
<2, (5, 4, 6)>
<3, (1, 4, 9)>
<4, (0, 3, 5)>
<5, (1, 2, 6)>
<6, (0, 5, 8)>
<7, (1, 5, 9)>
<8, (2, 4, 6)>
<9, (0, 3, 4)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
