Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 3

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star-like pattern.

From the adjacency list, we can see that the nodes with exactly three connections are:
- Node 1 (connected to 2 and 9)
- Node 3 (connected to 9)
- Node 4 (connected to 6 and 8)
- Node 5 (connected to 6)
- Node 7 (connected to 2 and 8)

Now, let's identify the unique 3-stars:
<1, (2, 9)>
<3, (9)>
<4, (6, 8)>
<5, (6)>
<7, (2, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
