Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can identify the nodes that form 3-stars with the center. Since a 3-star has the center connected to exactly three other nodes, we can identify potential 3-stars by looking for nodes that have exactly 3 neighbors. Here are the steps:

1. Identify nodes with exactly 3 neighbors:
   - Node 2 has 1 neighbor.
   - Node 3 has 2 neighbors.
   - Node 4 has 2 neighbors.
   - Node 5 has 2 neighbors.
   - Node 7 has 2 neighbors.
   - Node 8 has 2 neighbors.
   
2. Identify nodes with 3 neighbors:
   - Node 0 has 5 neighbors: 1, 6, 7, 8, 9.
   - Node 1 has 5 neighbors: 0, 3, 4, 6, 7.
   - Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 8, 9.
   - Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 0, 2, 6.

3. Count the number of 3-stars:
   - There are <0, (1, 6, 8)>, <0, (1, 6, 9)>.
   - There are <1, (0, 6, 7)>, <1, (0, 6, 9)>.
   - There is <6, (0, 1, 9)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
