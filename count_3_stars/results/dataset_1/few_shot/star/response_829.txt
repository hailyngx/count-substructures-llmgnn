Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star with that node as the center.

From the adjacency list provided, we can identify the following 3-stars: 
1. <2, (4, 6, 8)>
2. <4, (2, 3, 5)>
3. <5, (0, 4, 6)>
4. <6, (2, 5, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
