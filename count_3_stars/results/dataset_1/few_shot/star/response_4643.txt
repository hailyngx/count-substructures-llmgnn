Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all sets of 3 nodes where one node is connected to the other two nodes. These sets represent 3-stars in the graph.

Based on the given graph, the 3-stars can be formed as follows:
<0, (3, 5)>
<1, (4, 8)>
<4, (1, 2, 9)>
<4, (1, 6, 9)>
<4, (2, 6, 9)>
<6, (4, 8)>
<9, (3, 4, 7)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, the final answer is [7].
