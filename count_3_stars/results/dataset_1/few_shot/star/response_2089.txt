Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through the nodes' connections and find all 3-stars:

1. Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes (2, 6). <0, (2, 6)>
2. Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes (0, 5, 8). <2, (0, 5, 8)>
3. Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes (3, 7, 9). <4, (3, 7, 9)>
4. Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes (2, 3, 9). <5, (2, 3, 9)>
5. Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes (2, 4, 8). <9, (2, 4, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (2, 6)>, <2, (0, 5, 8)>, <4, (3, 7, 9)>, <5, (2, 3, 9)>, <9, (2, 4, 8)>.
