Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 6
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a 3-star configuration.

Let's list the 3-stars in the graph:

[<0, (2, 6, 8)>, <1, (2, 5, 6)>, <2, (0, 1, 6)>, <6, (0, 1, 2)>, <9, (1, 7, 9)>]

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
