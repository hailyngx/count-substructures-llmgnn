Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 5, and node 8

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 6: <0, (2, 3, 6)>
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 8: <1, (4, 6, 8)>
3. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 6, and 8: <3, (0, 6, 8)>
4. Node 4 is connected to nodes 1 and 7: <4, (1, 7, 8)>
5. Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 6, 7, and 9: <8, (1, 3, 6)>
6. Node 9 is connected to nodes 5 and 8: <9, (5, 8, 8)>

Therefore, there are [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
