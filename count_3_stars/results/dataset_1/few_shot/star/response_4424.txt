Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 4, 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star.
Here are the unique 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (3, 4), 1>
<1, (3, 4), 1>
<2, (3, 4, 6), 1>
<3, (0, 1, 2), 1>
<4, (0, 1, 2), 1>
<5, (2, 6, 8), 1>
<6, (2, 4, 5), 1>
<7, (5, 6, 8), 1>
<8, (5, 6, 7), 1>
<9, (3, 4, 7), 1>

There are [9] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
