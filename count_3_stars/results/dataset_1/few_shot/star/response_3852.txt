Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 5

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are:

<0, (4, 8, 9)>
<0, (5, 8, 9)> 
<5, (0, 8, 9)> 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
