Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 5, and node 8

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (0, 3, 7)>
<1, (5, 7, 8)>
<4, (1, 6, 8)>
<7, (1, 5, 8)>
