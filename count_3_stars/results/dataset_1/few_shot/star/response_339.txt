Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all subgraphs where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Based on the provided information, the possible 3-stars in the graph are as follows:
<0, (6, 7, 8)>
<0, (6, 7, 9)>
<0, (6, 8, 9)>
<0, (7, 8, 9)>
<1, (2, 7, 8)>
<1, (2, 7, 9)>
<1, (2, 8, 9)>
<1, (3, 7, 8)>
<1, (3, 7, 9)>
<1, (3, 8, 9)>
<2, (1, 4, 9)>
<7, (5, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [12].
