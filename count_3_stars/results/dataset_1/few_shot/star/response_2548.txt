Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, and node 4

Response:
Let's analyze the given graph to find the 3-star structures:

From the adjacency list, we can see that the nodes with exactly three neighbors are: 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. These nodes can potentially be the center of a 3-star.

Now, let's look at each of these nodes:

- Node 0: <0, (5, 7, 9)>
- Node 2: <2, (3, 6, 9)>
- Node 4: <4, (1, 3, 9)>
- Node 5: <5, (0, 1, 8)>
- Node 6: Not a center of a 3-star.
- Node 7: <7, (0, 1, _9_)>
- Node 8: <8, (5, _0_, _1_)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we have found:

[6] 
<0, (5, 7, 9)>, <2, (3, 6, 9)>, <4, (1, 3, 9)>, <5, (0, 1, 8)>, <7, (0, 1, _9_)>, <8, (5, _0_, _1_)>
