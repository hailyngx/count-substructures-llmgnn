Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars present. A 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Inspecting the given graph, we find the following 3-stars:
<0, (1, 8, 9)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<2, (5, 7, 9)>
<4, (1, 3, 9)>
<5, (2, 9, -)>
<7, (2, 9, -)>
<8, (0, 1, 2)>
<9, (0, 2, 4)>
<9, (0, 5, 6)>
<9, (0, 7, -)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
