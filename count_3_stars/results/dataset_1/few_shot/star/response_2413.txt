Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6

Response:
The central node in a 3-star graph is the node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. From the given graph, we can identify the following unique 3-stars:

<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<1, (0, 5, 6)>
<4, (3, 7, 8)>
<5, (0, 1, 6)>
<6, (1, 5, 7)>
<7, (1, 4, 8)>
<8, (1, 4, 6)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars gives us the total number of 3-stars in the graph. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
