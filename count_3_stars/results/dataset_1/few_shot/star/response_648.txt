Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 7

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the graph. The central nodes are the nodes with exactly three neighbors. In this case, nodes 2, 5, and 7 are the central nodes.

Now, let's find the 3-stars in the graph:
1. For central node 2: <2, (3, 4, 6)>
2. For central node 5: <5, (4, 7, 8)>
3. For central node 7: <7, (3, 5, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
