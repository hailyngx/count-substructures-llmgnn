Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify the central node and the three leaves connected to it for each 3-star. 

From the given adjacency list, we can identify the 3-stars by looking for nodes that have exactly three neighbors. 

The unique 3-stars in this graph are:
<0, (2, 9, -)>
<1, (4, 8, -)>
<5, (3, 6, 7)>
<6, (5, 8, -)>

Count of 3-stars: [4]
