Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 5) (4, 1) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify the central node and its three connected nodes in each 3-star configuration. Let's analyze the given graph step by step:

1. Calculate the degrees of each node:
   - Node 0: degree = 1
   - Node 1: degree = 3
   - Node 2: degree = 2
   - Node 3: degree = 1
   - Node 4: degree = 1
   - Node 5: degree = 2
   - Node 6: degree = 2
   - Node 7: degree = 1
   - Node 8: degree = 2
   - Node 9: degree = 1

2. Identify the 3-stars:
   - From the degrees, we can see that only Node 1 has a degree of 3, indicating it can be the center of a 3-star.
   - The neighbors of Node 1 are nodes 4, 5, and 8.

3. Count the number of 3-stars:
   - Number of 3-stars: [1]

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1].

Unique 3-stars: 
<1, (4, 5, 8)>
