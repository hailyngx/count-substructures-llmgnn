Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 8

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are part of any 3-star structures in the graph. Since a 3-star consists of the center node connected to exactly three other nodes, starting from the center node, let's identify all the unique 3-stars.

1. From node 0: No 3-star.
2. From node 1: <1, (0, 5, 7)>
3. From node 2: <2, (3, 4, 8)>
4. From node 3: No 3-star.
5. From node 4: <4, (2, 6, 9)>
6. From node 5: No 3-star.
7. From node 6: No 3-star.
8. From node 7: <7, (1, 8, 0)>
9. From node 8: <8, (2, 3, 7)>
10. From node 9: No 3-star.

Now, count the total number of unique 3-stars found.  
[<1, (0, 5, 7)>, <2, (3, 4, 8)>, <4, (2, 6, 9)>, <7, (1, 8, 0)>, <8, (2, 3, 7)>]
