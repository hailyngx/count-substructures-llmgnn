Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the 3-stars present. 

Let's go through each node in the graph and look for 3-stars:

- Node 0: No 3-star centered at node 0.
- Node 1: Possible 3-star centered at node 1 with leaves 2, 4, and 6.
- Node 2: Possible 3-star centered at node 2 with leaves 0, 1, and 6.
- Node 3: No 3-star centered at node 3.
- Node 4: No 3-star centered at node 4.
- Node 5: No 3-star centered at node 5.
- Node 6: Possible 3-star centered at node 6 with leaves 1, 2, and 8.
- Node 7: No 3-star centered at node 7.
- Node 8: No 3-star centered at node 8.
- Node 9: No 3-star centered at node 9.

Therefore, there are 3-stars at nodes 1, 2, and 6.

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<2, (0, 1, 6)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
