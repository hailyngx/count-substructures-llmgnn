Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 7
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the 3-stars. 

Let's identify the 3-stars step by step:
1. Find nodes with exactly 3 neighbors:
   - Node 0, Node 3, Node 4, Node 7, and Node 8 have exactly 3 neighbors.

2. For each of these nodes, check if they form a 3-star:
   - For Node 0: (0, 3, 4), (0, 4, 7), and (0, 3, 7) form 3-stars.
   - For Node 3: (3, 0, 9) forms a 3-star.
   - For Node 4: (4, 0, 6) forms a 3-star.
   - For Node 7: (7, 0, 2) forms a 3-star.
   - For Node 8: (8, 2, 5) forms a 3-star.

3. Count the total number of unique 3-stars: 
   - There are a total of 5 unique 3-stars found.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5]. 

The unique 3-stars found are <0, (3, 4, 7)>, <0, (3, 7, 4)>, <4, (0, 6, ∅)>, <3, (0, 9, ∅)>, <7, (0, 2, ∅)>.
