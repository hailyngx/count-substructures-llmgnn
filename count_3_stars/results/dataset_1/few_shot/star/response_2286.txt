Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a 3-star pattern. 

Starting with each node:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star <0, (3, 4)> with nodes 3 and 4.
- Node 1 forms a 3-star <1, (4, 7)> with nodes 4 and 7.
- Node 2 does not form any 3-star as it is connected to only 2 nodes.
- Node 3 forms two 3-stars: <3, (0, 5)> and <3, (4, 6)>.
- Node 4 forms two 3-stars: <4, (0, 1)> and <4, (6, 8)>.
- Node 5 does not form any 3-star as it is connected to only 1 node.
- Node 6 forms one 3-star: <6, (2, 4)>.
- Node 7 does not form any 3-star as it is connected to only 2 nodes.
- Node 8 does not form any 3-star as it is connected to only 2 nodes.
- Node 9 does not form any 3-star as it is connected to only 2 nodes.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].

Unique 3-stars found: 
<0, (3, 4)>
<1, (4, 7)>
<3, (0, 5)>
<3, (4, 6)>
<6, (2, 4)>
