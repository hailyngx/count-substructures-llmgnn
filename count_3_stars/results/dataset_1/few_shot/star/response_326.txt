Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5)

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to look for central nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes (leaves). Let's find and count these 3-stars step by step:

1. Central node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 4. So, <0, (2, 3, 4)> is a 3-star.
2. Central node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 6. So, <1, (3, 4, 6)> is a 3-star.
3. Central node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 7. So, <2, (0, 4, 7)> is a 3-star.
4. Central node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 5. So, <3, (0, 1, 5)> is a 3-star.
5. Central node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2. So, <4, (0, 1, 2)> is a 3-star.
6. Central node 5 has only 4 connections and is not a central node for any 3-star.
7. Central node 6 is connected to nodes 1 and 7. It doesn't have 3 connections and is not a central node for any 3-star.
8. Central node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 4. So, <7, (2, 3, 4)> is a 3-star.
9. Central node 8 has only 2 connections and is not a central node for any 3-star.
10. Central node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3. So, <9, (0, 1, 3)> is a 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
