Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 4
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0 forms a 3-star with leaves 4, 5, and 7: <0, (4, 5, 7)>
2. Node 3 forms a 3-star with leaves 2, 5, and 7: <3, (2, 5, 7)>
3. Node 4 forms a 3-star with leaves 0, 2, and 7: <4, (0, 2, 7)>
4. Node 5 forms a 3-star with leaves 0, 3, and 6: <5, (0, 3, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
