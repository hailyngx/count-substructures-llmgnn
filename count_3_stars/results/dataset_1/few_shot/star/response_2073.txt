Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern.

Upon examining the graph and the provided adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-star patterns:
<0, (3, 4, 9)>
<1, (5, 6, 7)>
<3, (0, 5, 9)>
<4, (0, 9, 3)>
<5, (1, 2, 6)>
<6, (1, 5, 8)>
<7, (1, 8, 6)>
<8, (6, 7, 9)>
<9, (3, 4, 8)>

Count of 3-stars: [9]
