Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 7) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 6, and node 8

Response:
There are <0, (2, 5, 8)>, <1, (5, 6, 9)>, and <6, (1, 4, 9)> 3-stars in the graph. 
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
