Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, 7, and node 8

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:
1. For each node as a potential center of a 3-star, check if it has exactly 3 neighbors. If so, count it as a valid 3-star.
2. List all unique 3-stars found.

Number of 3-stars: [3]

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 3, 6)>
<3, (0, 6, 9)>
<7, (1, 8, 9)>
