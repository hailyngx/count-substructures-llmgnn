Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (6, 0) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 7
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 6

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all possible 3-stars. A 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes.

From the given information, we can deduce the following 3-stars:

<0, (3, 6, 7)>
<2, (8, 6, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
