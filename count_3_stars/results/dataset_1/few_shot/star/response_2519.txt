Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 3
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first identify the 3-stars by finding all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Then we count the total unique 3-stars in the graph.

Starting from the adjacency list, we look for nodes that have connections to exactly three other nodes. Let's list the unique 3-stars below:

<0, (2, 6, 2)>
<1, (3, 4, 3)>
<7, (8, 9, 8)>

Count of 3-stars: [3]
