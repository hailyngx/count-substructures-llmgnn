Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 9) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's go through each node in the graph to find the 3-stars:

1. Node 0: Connected to nodes 1, 4, and 7
   - <0, (1, 4, 7)>
  
2. Node 1: Connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 5, and 6
   - <1, (0, 2, 3)>
   - <1, (0, 5, 6)>
  
3. Node 2: Connected to nodes 1, 3, and 5
   - <2, (1, 3, 5)>
  
4. Node 3: Connected to nodes 1, 2, and 4
   - <3, (1, 2, 4)>
  
5. Node 4: Connected to nodes 0 and 3
   (No 3-stars as it's not connected to exactly three other nodes)
  
6. Node 5: Connected to nodes 1 and 2
   (No 3-stars as it's not connected to exactly three other nodes)
  
7. Node 6: Connected to nodes 1 and 2
   (No 3-stars as it's not connected to exactly three other nodes)
  
8. Node 7: Connected to nodes 0 and 9
   (No 3-stars as it's not connected to exactly three other nodes)
  
9. Node 8: Not connected to any other nodes
   (No 3-stars as it's not connected to any other nodes)

10. Node 9: Connected to node 7
   (No 3-stars as it's not connected to exactly three other nodes)

The unique 3-stars found are:  
<0, (1, 4, 7)>, <1, (0, 2, 3)>, <1, (0, 5, 6)>, <2, (1, 3, 5)>, <3, (1, 2, 4)>  
Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
