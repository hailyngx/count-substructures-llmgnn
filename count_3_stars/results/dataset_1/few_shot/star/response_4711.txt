Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 7, and node 9
