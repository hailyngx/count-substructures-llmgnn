Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 2

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to understand that a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we can see that some nodes have a degree of 3, which indicates potential 3-stars:

- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, 7, 8, and 9 (degree 6).
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 7, and 8 (degree 4).
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 3, 7, and 8 (degree 3).
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 6 (degree 3).
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 7 (degree 3).
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, and 6 (degree 4).
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 4 (degree 3).

Let's identify the unique 3-stars in this graph:

1. <2, (0, 1, 3)>
2. <2, (0, 1, 7)>
3. <2, (0, 1, 8)>
4. <2, (0, 1, 9)>
5. <2, (1, 3, 7)>
6. <2, (1, 3, 8)>
7. <2, (1, 7, 8)>
8. <3, (2, 4, 8)>
9. <5, (0, 1, 6)>
10. <6, (1, 5, 7)>

There are 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the count of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
