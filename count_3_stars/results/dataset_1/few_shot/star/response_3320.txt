Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to understand what constitutes a 3-star. As mentioned earlier, a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

From the adjacency list and provided edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<0, (4, 5, 9)>
<4, (0, 5, 7)>
<5, (0, 1, 6)>
<9, (0, 2, 4)>

Now, we list the unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<0, (4, 5, 9)>
<4, (0, 5, 7)>
<5, (0, 1, 6)>
<9, (0, 2, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
