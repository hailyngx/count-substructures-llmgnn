Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars by finding nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Then we count the unique 3-stars that we find.

Let's start by listing the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:

- Node 0: Connected to nodes 1, 4, 7, and 8 (forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 4, and 8)
  <0, (1, 4, 8)>

- Node 1: Connected to nodes 0, 5, 6, and 9 (forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 5, and 6)
  <1, (0, 5, 6)>

- Node 4: Connected to nodes 0, 3, and 6 (forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 3, and 6)
  <4, (0, 3, 6)>

- Node 8: Connected to nodes 0, 2, and 9 (forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 2, and 9)
  <8, (0, 2, 9)>

Therefore, there are [3] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
