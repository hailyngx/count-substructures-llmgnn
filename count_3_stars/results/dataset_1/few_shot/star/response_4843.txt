Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 4) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 5
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 3

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

From the adjacency list provided, we can see that the nodes with three connections are:
- Node 0 (connected to nodes 2, 4, 5)
- Node 4 (connected to nodes 0, 5, 7)
- Node 5 (connected to nodes 0, 4, 6)

Let's list the unique 3-stars we can form in this graph:
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<4, (0, 5, 7)>
<5, (0, 4, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
