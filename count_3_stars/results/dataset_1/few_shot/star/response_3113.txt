Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 5

Response:
Step 1: Identify the nodes with exactly 3 neighbors.
- Node 1 and Node 3 have exactly 3 neighbors.

Step 2: For each node identified, check if it forms a 3-star.
- For Node 1:
    Node 1 has neighbors: 0, 3, 5, 6, 7.
    <1, (0, 5, 6)>
    <1, (0, 5, 7)>
    <1, (0, 6, 7)>
    <1, (3, 5, 6)>
    <1, (3, 5, 7)>
    <1, (3, 6, 7)>
    
- For Node 3:
    Node 3 has neighbors: 1, 4, 6, 8.
    <3, (1, 4, 6)>
    <3, (1, 4, 8)>
    <3, (1, 6, 8)>
    <3, (4, 6, 8)>

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
<1, (0, 5, 6)>, <1, (0, 5, 7)>, <1, (0, 6, 7)>, <1, (3, 5, 6)>, <1, (3, 5, 7)>, <1, (3, 6, 7)>, <3, (1, 4, 6)>, <3, (1, 4, 8)>, <3, (1, 6, 8)>
