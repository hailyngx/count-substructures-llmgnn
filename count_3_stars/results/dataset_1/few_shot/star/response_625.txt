Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern. 

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, and 4: <0, (1, 3, 4)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 6, and 8: <1, (0, 6, 8)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 4, and 6: <3, (0, 4, 6)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 3, and 5: <4, (0, 3, 5)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 2, and 4: <8, (1, 2, 4)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, and 5: <9, (1, 3, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
