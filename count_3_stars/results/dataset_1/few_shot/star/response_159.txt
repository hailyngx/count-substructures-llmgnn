Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all occurrences where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes (leaves) by edges. Let's analyze the graph based on the provided information:

Central Node 0:
- Connected to nodes 2 and 5.
- It forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 2, and 5.

Central Node 1:
- Connected to nodes 2, 4, and 7.
- It forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 2, 4 and a 3-star with nodes 1, 2, 7.

Central Node 2:
- Connected to nodes 0, 1, and 3.
- It forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 0, 1 and a 3-star with nodes 2, 0, 3.

Central Node 3:
- Connected to nodes 2, 5, and 7.
- It forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 2, 5 and a 3-star with nodes 3, 2, 7.

Central Nodes 4, 6, 8, and 9:
- These central nodes do not form 3-stars as they are not connected to exactly three other nodes.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is counted as [4] in total.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 5)>
<1, (2, 4), (2, 7)>
<2, (0, 1), (0, 3)>
<3, (2, 5), (2, 7)>
