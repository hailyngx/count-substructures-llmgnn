Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node has exactly three neighbors and forms a 3-star pattern. 

Looking at the adjacency list provided, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (4, 7, 8)>
<7, (0, 1, 8)>
<8, (0, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3]. 
Unique 3-stars in the graph are: <0, (4, 7, 8)>, <7, (0, 1, 8)>, <8, (0, 7, 9)>.
