Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that is the center of a 3-star pattern. A 3-star pattern is formed when a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Based on the given information, we can identify the following 3-stars in the graph:

<2, (0, 5, 6)>
<2, (0, 5, 7)>
<5, (2, 3, 8)>
<5, (2, 8, 9)>
<8, (2, 3, 6)>
<8, (2, 3, 9)>
<8, (2, 5, 6)>
<8, (2, 5, 7)>
<8, (2, 6, 7)>
<8, (3, 5, 9)>

Counting all the unique 3-stars, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
