Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star pattern.

Upon analyzing the provided information, we can identify the following 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (1, 5, 3)>
<1, (0, 4, 2)>
<3, (4, 5, 9)>
<4, (1, 2, 8)>
<5, (0, 3, 7)>
<7, (3, 5, 6)>
<8, (2, 4, 9)>
<9, (3, 8, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 5, 3)>
<1, (0, 4, 2)>
<3, (4, 5, 9)>
<4, (1, 2, 8)>
<5, (0, 3, 7)>
<7, (3, 5, 6)>
<8, (2, 4, 9)>
<9, (3, 8, 0)>
