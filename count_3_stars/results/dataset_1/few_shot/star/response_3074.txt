Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that can be the center of a 3-star graph. Since a 3-star must have exactly 3 leaves, any node with degree at least 3 can potentially be the center. 
In this graph, nodes 0, 1, 2, 6, and 8 have degree at least 3. 

Let's consider each potential center node and check if they can form a 3-star graph:
1. Node 0:
   The neighbors of node 0 are 1, 4, 6, and 8. 
   - With node 1: <0, (1, 4, 6)>
   - With node 4: <0, (4, 2, 6)>
   - With node 6: <0, (6, 1, 4)>
   - With node 8: <0, (8, 6, 1)>

2. Node 1:
   The neighbors of node 1 are 0, 2, 3, and 6.
   - With node 0: <1, (0, 6, 8)>
   - With node 2: <1, (2, 4, 6)>
   - With node 3: <1, (3, 9, -)>
   - With node 6: <1, (6, 0, 2)>

3. Node 2:
   The neighbors of node 2 are 1, 4, 6, and 7.
   - With node 1: <2, (1, 6, 0)>
   - With node 4: <2, (4, 0, 6)>
   - With node 6: <2, (6, 1, 0)>
   - With node 7: <2, (7, 5, -)>

4. Node 6:
   The neighbors of node 6 are 0, 1, 2, 4, and 8.
   - With node 0: <6, (0, 1, 8)>
   - With node 1: <6, (1, 0, 2)>
   - With node 2: <6, (2, 1, 0)>
   - With node 4: <6, (4, 0, 2)>
   - With node 8: <6, (8, 0, 7)>

5. Node 8:
   The neighbors of node 8 are 0, 6, and 7.
   - With node 0: <8, (0, 1, 6)>
   - With node 6: <8, (6, 0, 1)>
   - With node 7: <8, (7, 2, -)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15]. 
The unique 3-stars are <0, (1, 4, 6)>, <0, (4, 2, 6)>, <0, (6, 1, 4)>, <0, (8, 6, 1)>, <1, (0, 6, 8)>, <1, (2, 4, 6)>, <1, (3, 9, -)>, <1, (6, 0, 2)>, <2, (1, 6, 0)>, <2, (4, 0, 6)>, <2, (6, 1, 0)>, <2, (7, 5, -)>, <6, (0, 1, 8)>, <6, (1, 0, 2)>, <8, (0, 1, 6)>.
