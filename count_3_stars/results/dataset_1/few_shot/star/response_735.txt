Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the unique sets of nodes that form 3-stars around a central node. 

Looking at the adjacency list and the definition of a 3-star, we need to find nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes (3 leaves).

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 4, and 5. Therefore, <0, (2, 4, 5)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 6, and 7. Therefore, <1, (3, 6, 7)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 4, and 6. Therefore, <2, (0, 4, 6)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, and 5. Therefore, <4, (0, 1, 5)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 2, and 8. Therefore, <6, (1, 2, 8)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 3, and 9. Therefore, <8, (0, 3, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
