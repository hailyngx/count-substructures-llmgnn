Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the nodes where a 3-star pattern can be formed. A 3-star pattern consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify all the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (1, 9)>
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<2, (1, 6, 9)>
<3, (1, 6, 5)>
<6, (2, 3, 5)>
<9, (0, 2, 5)>

Count of 3-stars: [6]
