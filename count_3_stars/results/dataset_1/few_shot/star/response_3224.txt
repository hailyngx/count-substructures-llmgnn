Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 8

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes are: 0, 4, and 8.

Now, for each central node, we identify the 3-stars:
For central node 0:
- <0, (2, 4, 9)>

For central node 4:
- <4, (0, 5, 8)>
- <4, (0, 8, 9)>

For central node 8:
- <8, (1, 2, 9)>
- <8, (1, 4, 9)>
- <8, (2, 4, 9)>
- <8, (4, 9, 5)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars, we get a total of [7].
