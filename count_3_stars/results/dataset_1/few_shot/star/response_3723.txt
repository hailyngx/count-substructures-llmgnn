Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern.

In this graph, the following 3-stars can be found:
<1, (3, 6, 9)>
<2, (4, 5, 6)>
<4, (2, 3, 5)>
<5, (2, 4, 8)>
<6, (1, 2, 7)>
<7, (2, 4, 6)>
<8, (2, 4, 5)>
<9, (1, 4, 5)>

Counting these unique 3-stars, we find a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
