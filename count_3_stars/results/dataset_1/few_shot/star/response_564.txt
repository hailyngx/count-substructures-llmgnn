Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 8

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
1. Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 5, and 9: <0, (2, 5, 9)>
2. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 5, and 7: <1, (4, 5, 7)>
3. Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 6, and 8: <3, (4, 6, 8)>
4. Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 3, and 9: <8, (2, 3, 9)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
