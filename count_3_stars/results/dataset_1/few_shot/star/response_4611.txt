Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node:

Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 5

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for each node and see if it forms a 3-star with three other nodes. 

Let's go through each node:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors (3, 7, 8, 9). It forms 4 different 3-stars: <0, (3, 7, 8)>, <0, (3, 7, 9)>, <0, (3, 8, 9)>, <0, (7, 8, 9)>
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors (2, 5). It does not form a 3-star as it does not have exactly 3 neighbors.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors (1, 3, 5). It forms 1 3-star: <2, (1, 3, 5)>
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors (0, 2, 7, 9). It forms 4 different 3-stars: <3, (0, 2, 7)>, <3, (0, 2, 9)>, <3, (0, 7, 9)>, <3, (2, 7, 9)>
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors (6, 8, 9). It forms 1 3-star: <4, (6, 8, 9)>
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors (1, 2, 9). It does not form a 3-star as it does not have exactly 3 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors (4, 7). It does not form a 3-star as it does not have exactly 3 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors (0, 3, 6). It does not form a 3-star as it does not have exactly 3 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors (0, 4). It does not form a 3-star as it does not have exactly 3 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors (0, 3, 4, 5). It forms 4 different 3-stars: <9, (0, 3, 4)>, <9, (0, 3, 5)>, <9, (0, 4, 5)>, <9, (3, 4, 5)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (3, 7, 8)>
<0, (3, 7, 9)>
<0, (3, 8, 9)>
<0, (7, 8, 9)>
<2, (1, 3, 5)>
<3, (0, 2, 7)>
<3, (0, 2, 9)>
<3, (0, 7, 9)>
<3, (2, 7, 9)>
<4, (6, 8, 9)>
<9, (0, 3, 4)>
<9, (0, 3, 5)>
<9, (0, 4, 5)>
<9, (3, 4, 5)>
