Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 3

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node has exactly three neighbors forming a 3-star configuration. 

Based on the adjacency list, we can see that the nodes with exactly three neighbors are:
- Node 0: connected to nodes 2, 5, 7
- Node 3: connected to nodes 8, 9
- Node 4: connected to node 5
- Node 6: connected to node 7
- Node 9: connected to node 3

Let's list the unique 3-stars:
<0, (2, 5, 7)>
<3, (8, 9)>
<6, (7)>
<9, (3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
