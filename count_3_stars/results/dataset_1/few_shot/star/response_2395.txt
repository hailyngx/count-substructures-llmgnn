Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible configurations where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in the form of a star.

Based on the given graph, the 3-star configurations are as follows:
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<1, (0, 7, 8)>
<2, (0, 3, 1)>
<3, (2, 1, 0)>
<4, (5)>
<5, (4)>
<6, (7)>
<7, (1, 6, 9)>
<8, (1)>
<9, (7)>

There are a total of 9 3-stars in the given graph.
