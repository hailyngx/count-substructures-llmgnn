Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all unique 3-stars.

Let's list all the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (5, 9)>
<1, (2, 5)>
<2, (1, 4, 6)>
<2, (6, 7)>
<3, (5, 7)>
<4, (2, 6)>
<5, (0, 1, 3)>
<5, (6, 8, 9)>
<6, (2, 4, 5)>
<6, (5, 9)>
<7, (2, 3, 8)>
<8, (5, 7)>
<9, (0, 5, 6)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars found in the graph.
