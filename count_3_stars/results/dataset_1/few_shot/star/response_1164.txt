Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a center node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step by step to identify these 3-stars.

1. Identify Nodes with Exactly 3 Neighbors:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors (5 and 6).
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors (6, 8, and 9).
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors (2 and 9).

2. Count the 3-stars:
- For Node 2 as the center: (2, 6, 8, 9) - Not a 3-star because Node 8 only has 2 neighbors.
- For Node 8 as the center: (8, 2, 9) - Not a 3-star because Node 2 only has 3 neighbors.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [0]. 

<0, (5, 6)>
<2, (6, 8, 9)>
<8, (2, 9)>
