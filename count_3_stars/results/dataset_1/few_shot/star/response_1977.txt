Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes (a 3-star pattern). Let's find these patterns step-by-step:

1. From the provided information, nodes 1, 3, 8, and 9 have 3 or more connections, so we will focus on these nodes to identify 3-stars.

2. Let's analyze each of these nodes:
   - Node 1 has connections with nodes 0, 3, 5, 6, and 8.
   - Node 3 has connections with nodes 0, 1, 4, and 7.
   - Node 8 has connections with nodes 1, 2, 5, 6, and 9.
   - Node 9 has connections with nodes 4, 7, and 8.

3. We observe that Node 1 and Node 8 can form multiple 3-star patterns. Let's list the unique 3-stars:

   <1, (0, 3, 5)>
   <1, (0, 3, 6)>
   <1, (0, 3, 8)>
   <1, (3, 4, 7)>
   <1, (5, 8, 2)>
   <1, (5, 8, 6)>
   <1, (5, 8, 9)>
   <1, (6, 8, 2)>
   <1, (6, 8, 9)>
   <1, (8, 2, 7)>
   <1, (8, 2, 9)>
   <1, (8, 5, 6)>
   <1, (8, 5, 9)>
   <1, (8, 6, 9)>
   <8, (1, 0, 3)>
   <8, (1, 3, 4)>
   <8, (1, 5, 6)>
   <8, (1, 6, 9)>
   <8, (2, 7, 3)>
   <8, (2, 7, 9)>
   <8, (2, 5, 6)>
   <8, (2, 9, 4)>
   <8, (5, 1, 6)>
   <8, (5, 1, 9)>
   <8, (5, 6, 9)>
   <8, (6, 1, 9)>
   <8, (6, 5, 9)>

4. Counting the total number of unique 3-stars found, we get [27].
