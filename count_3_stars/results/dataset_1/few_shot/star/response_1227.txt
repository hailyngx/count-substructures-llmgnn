Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star structure.
Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (2, 6, 9)>
<1, (2, 3, 4)>
<2, (0, 1, 5)>
<4, (1, 5, 6)>
<5, (2, 3, 4)>
<6, (0, 1, 4)>
