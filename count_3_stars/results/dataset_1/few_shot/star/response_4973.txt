Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 46 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 5, 7, and node 8
