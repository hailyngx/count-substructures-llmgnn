Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Identify nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
   - Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 5.
   - Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 4.
   - Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, and 5.
   - Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 9.

2. We see that Node 0, Node 1, and Node 4 are potential central nodes of 3-stars. Let's list the unique 3-stars that can be formed using these nodes:

<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<4, (1, 2, 3)>

3. Count the total number of 3-stars: [3]
