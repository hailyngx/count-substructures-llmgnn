Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 0) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 8

Response:
There are 3-star configurations in this graph. Let's find and list them:

<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<1, (0, 2, 5)>
<6, (0, 3, 8)>
<9, (2, 7, 8)>
