Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 8

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

Based on the definition of a 3-star graph, we can look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes to identify the 3-stars.

The nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes are:
- Node 0 (connected to nodes 5, 6, 9)
- Node 1 (connected to nodes 3, 4, 5)
- Node 2 (connected to nodes 3, 6, 8)
- Node 3 (connected to nodes 1, 2, 8)
- Node 4 (connected to nodes 1, 9)
- Node 5 (connected to nodes 0, 1, 9)
- Node 6 (connected to nodes 0, 2)
- Node 9 (connected to nodes 0, 4, 5)

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<0, (5, 6, 9)>
<1, (3, 4, 5)>
<2, (3, 6, 8)>
<3, (1, 2, 8)>
<4, (1, 9)>
<5, (0, 1, 9)>

Count of 3-stars: [6]
