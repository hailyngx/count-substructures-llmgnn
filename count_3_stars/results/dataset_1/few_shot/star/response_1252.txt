Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a 3-star pattern.

Let's list the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (3, 8, 9)>
<1, (3, 5, 6)>
<2, (3, 6, 9)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<5, (1, 3, 9)>
<6, (1, 2, 4)>
<8, (0, 1, 3)>
<9, (0, 2, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
