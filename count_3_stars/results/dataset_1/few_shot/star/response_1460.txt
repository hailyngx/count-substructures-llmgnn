Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 8

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<1, (0, 2, 5)>
<2, (1, 3, 8)>
<3, (2, 7)>
<5, (0, 1, 6)>
<6, (4, 5, 8)>
<7, (0, 3)>
<8, (2, 6, 9)>

There are a total of [8] 3-stars in the graph.
