Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 3
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern.

From the given edges and adjacency list, we can see that the 3-star patterns are formed by a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list out the unique 3-stars:

<1, (0, 6, 8)>
<1, (3, 5, 9)>
<2, (0, 3, 9)>
<3, (1, 2, 8)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we find that there are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.
