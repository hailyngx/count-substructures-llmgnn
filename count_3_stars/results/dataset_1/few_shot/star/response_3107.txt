Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify sets of nodes where one node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star pattern. 

Based on the adjacency list and the definition of a 3-star graph, we can identify the following unique 3-stars:
<0, (3, 8, 9)>
<1, (2, 4, 9)>
<2, (1, 3, 7)>
<3, (0, 2, 9)>
<4, (1, 7, 9)>
<6, (5, 7, 9)>
<7, (2, 4, 6)>
<8, (0, 9, 3)>

So, the total count of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
