Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1

Response:
Starting with the definition of a 3-star graph in mind, we can identify the 3-stars within the given graph:

<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<1, (0, 6, 7)>
<1, (3, 8, 9)>
<3, (1, 2, 4)>
<6, (1, 7, 8)>
<7, (1, 6, 8)>
<8, (1, 3, 5)>
<8, (6, 7, 1)>
