Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 4

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<0, (1, 5, 9)>
<0, (1, 7, 9)>
<0, (5, 7, 9)>
<4, (2, 8, 9)>
<7, (0, 3, 9)>

So, there are a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
