Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 3

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first understand that a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Given the graph information, we look for nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them, which will be the central nodes of potential 3-stars.

From the adjacency list, we identify the potential central nodes:
- Node 1 has 3 edges connected to it: (1, 2), (1, 5), (1, 6)
- Node 3 has 3 edges connected to it: (3, 2), (3, 8), (3, 9)

Now, we examine the connections of these central nodes to find the 3-stars:

For Node 1:
- <1, (2, 6, 5)>
- There is only one unique 3-star with Node 1 as the center and nodes 2, 6, and 5 as leaves.

For Node 3:
- <3, (2, 8, 9)>
- There is only one unique 3-star with Node 3 as the center and nodes 2, 8, and 9 as leaves.

Count of unique 3-stars: [2]
Unique 3-stars: <<1, (2, 6, 5)>, <3, (2, 8, 9)>>
