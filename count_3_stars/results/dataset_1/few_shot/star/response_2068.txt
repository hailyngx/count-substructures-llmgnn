Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern.

From the adjacency list provided, we can identify the central nodes and their corresponding leaves:

1. Central node: 0 (Connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 9)
   Leaves: 1, 2, 3

2. Central node: 1 (Connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, 6, 9)
   Leaves: 0, 2, 4

3. Central node: 2 (Connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, 4)
   Leaves: 0, 1, 3

4. Central node: 3 (Connected to nodes 0, 2, 5)
   Leaves: 0, 2, 5

5. Central node: 4 (Connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 9)
   Leaves: 0, 1, 2

6. Central node: 5 (Connected to nodes 3, 7)
   Leaves: 3, 7

7. Central node: 6 (Connected to nodes 1, 9)
   Leaves: 1, 9

8. Central node: 7 (Connected to nodes 5, 8)
   Leaves: 5, 8

9. Central node: 8 (Connected to nodes 7, 9)
   Leaves: 7, 9

10. Central node: 9 (Connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, 6, 8)
    Leaves: 0, 1, 4

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:

<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<1, (0, 2, 4)>
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<3, (0, 2, 5)>
<4, (0, 1, 2)>
<5, (3, 7)>
<6, (1, 9)>
<7, (5, 8)>
<8, (7, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
