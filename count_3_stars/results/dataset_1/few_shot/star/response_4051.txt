Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 8

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars in the graph where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's start by listing out the 3-stars we find:

<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<0, (3, 8, 5)>
<0, (4, 1, 8)>
<0, (5, 9, 8)>
<1, (7, 4, 8)>
<2, (3, 6, 7)>
<3, (2, 6, 7)>
<3, (6, 7, 8)>
<7, (8, 9, 1)>
<8, (0, 1, 3)>
<8, (1, 7, 9)>
<8, (9, 7, 5)>

Count of 3-stars: [12]
