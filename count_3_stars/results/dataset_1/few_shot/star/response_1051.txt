Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, and node 9

Node 6 is connected to node 3, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible 3-stars based on the given edges. 

We can do this by looking at each node and its connections to form 3-stars. A 3-star has a center node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

1. Node 0: (0, 1, 7), (0, 2, 8), (0, 7, 6), (0, 8, 9) 
2. Node 1: (1, 0, 7), (1, 7, 6), (1, 8, 9) 
3. Node 2: (2, 0, 8) 
4. Node 3: (3, 2, 4), (3, 4, 6), (3, 6, 8), (3, 9, 8) 
5. Node 4: (4, 3, 6), (4, 6, 8), (4, 8, 9) 
6. Node 6: (6, 3, 4), (6, 4, 8), (6, 7, 0), (6, 8, 9) 
7. Node 7: (7, 0, 1), (7, 1, 6) 
8. Node 8: (8, 0, 9), (8, 1, 9), (8, 2, 0), (8, 4, 6), (8, 6, 3), (8, 6, 4) 
9. Node 9: (9, 3, 8), (9, 4, 8) 

Hence, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [19]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 7, 6)>
<0, (2, 8, 9)>
<3, (2, 4, 6)>
<3, (4, 6, 8)>
<3, (6, 8, 9)>
<3, (9, 8)>
<8, (0, 9)>
<8, (1, 9)>
<8, (2, 0)>
<8, (4, 6)>
<8, (6, 3)>
<8, (6, 4)>
