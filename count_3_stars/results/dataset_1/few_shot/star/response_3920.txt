Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 2

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is at the center of a 3-star. Let's analyze the graph:

From the adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars:
1. <0, (1, 5, 6)>
2. <1, (0, 8, not connected)>
3. <2, (4, 6, 7)>
4. <4, (2, 6, not connected)>
5. <5, (0, not connected, not connected)>
6. <6, (0, 2, 3)>
7. <8, (0, 1, not connected)>
8. <9, (2, not connected, not connected)>

Therefore, there are a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
