Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to understand what constitutes a 3-star. As stated before, a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Here is the step-by-step process to count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Identify all the nodes in the graph.
Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

2. Check the adjacency of each node to identify nodes connected by edges.
Adjacency list:
- Node 0: {2, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 1: {5, 6}
- Node 2: {0, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 3: {4}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 3, 5}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 2, 4, 7}
- Node 6: {1, 9}
- Node 7: {2, 5, 8}
- Node 8: {0, 7}
- Node 9: {6}

3. Count the number of 3-stars in the given graph by identifying nodes with exactly three connections and checking if they form a 3-star structure.
Let's list the 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<2, (0, 4, 5)>
<4, (0, 2, 5)>
<5, (0, 2, 4)>
<7, (2, 5, 8)>
