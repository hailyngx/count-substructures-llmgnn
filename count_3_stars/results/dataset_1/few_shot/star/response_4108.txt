Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern.

Here are the steps to find the 3-stars:

1. Identify all nodes connected to exactly three other nodes:
   - Node 5: Connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, and 6.
   - Node 6: Connected to nodes 2, 5, 7, and 9.
   - Node 8: Connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, and 9.

2. Count the 3-stars:
   - 3-stars centered at node 5: <5, (0, 3, 4)>, <5, (0, 3, 6)>
   - 3-stars centered at node 6: <6, (2, 5, 7)>, <6, (2, 5, 9)>
   - 3-stars centered at node 8: <8, (2, 3, 4)>, <8, (2, 3, 9)>, <8, (2, 4, 9)>, <8, (3, 4, 9)>

3. Summarize the results:
   - There are a total of [9] unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

Therefore, the final answer is [9].
