Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 8

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

<1, (4, 6, 8)>
<1, (6, 8, 9)>
<1, (8, 2, 6)>
<1, (8, 6, 9)>
<2, (3, 6, 8)>
<2, (6, 7, 8)>
<4, (1, 5, 7)>
<6, (1, 8, 9)>
<7, (2, 4, 8)>
<8, (1, 2, 6)>
<8, (1, 6, 9)>
<8, (2, 3, 6)>
<8, (6, 7, 9)>

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [13].
