Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 2

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. Based on the adjacency list provided, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph.

The 3-stars in the given graph are as follows:
<0, (3, 6, 8)>
<0, (3, 6, 9)>
<0, (3, 8, 9)>
<2, (3, 4, 6)>
<3, (0, 2, 4)>
<6, (0, 2, 7)>
<6, (2, 5, 8)>
<6, (5, 7, 8)>
<8, (0, 5, 7)>
<9, (0, 2, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
