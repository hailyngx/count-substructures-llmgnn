Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible 3-stars. 

First, let's list all the nodes that are connected to three other nodes:

- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 4
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 7
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 8, and 9
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 5, and 7

Now, we can identify the 3-stars present in the graph by looking at possible combinations of nodes connected to the central node. Here are the unique 3-stars found:

<1, (0, 2, 4)>
<2, (1, 5, 7)>
<5, (0, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 5, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
