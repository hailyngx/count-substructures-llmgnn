Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will identify each unique 3-star structure and count how many times each occurs.

Here are the unique 3-star structures in the given graph:

<1, (3, 4, 9)>
<2, (4, 6, 8)>
<3, (1, 6, 7)>
<4, (1, 2, 9)>
<5, (7, 8, 9)>
<6, (2, 3, 9)>
<7, (3, 5, 9)>
<8, (2, 5, 9)>
<9, (4, 5, 6)>

Counting how many times each unique 3-star structure occurs in the graph: 
<1, (3, 4, 9)> - 1 occurrence 
<2, (4, 6, 8)> - 1 occurrence 
<3, (1, 6, 7)> - 1 occurrence 
<4, (1, 2, 9)> - 1 occurrence 
<5, (7, 8, 9)> - 1 occurrence 
<6, (2, 3, 9)> - 1 occurrence 
<7, (3, 5, 9)> - 1 occurrence 
<8, (2, 5, 9)> - 1 occurrence 
<9, (4, 5, 6)> - 1 occurrence 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
