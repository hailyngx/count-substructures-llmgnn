Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all occurrences where a node has exactly three neighbors connected to it. 

There are four 3-star patterns in this graph:

1. <0, (1, 3, 5)>
2. <1, (0, 3, 5)>
3. <3, (0, 1, 9)>
4. <7, (4, 8, 9)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
