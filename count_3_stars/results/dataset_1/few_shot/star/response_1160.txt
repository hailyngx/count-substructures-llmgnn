Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 5, and node 8

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (2, 6, 1)>
<1, (4, 6, 8)>
<5, (6, 7, 9)>
<6, (0, 1, 5)>
<8, (1, 7, 9)>
