Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. Based on the adjacency list and the definition of a 3-star graph, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. <1, (2, 3, 8)>
2. <2, (1, 5, 8)>
3. <8, (1, 2, 9)>
4. <9, (2, 4, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
