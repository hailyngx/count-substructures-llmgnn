Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through the adjacency list and find all unique 3-stars:

<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<1, (2, 4, 7)>
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<3, (2, 4, 6)>
<4, (0, 1, 2)>
<5, (3, 4, 7)>
<6, (0, 2, 3)>
<7, (1, 2, 5)>
<8, (3, 5, 9)>
<9, (2, 6, 8)>

Counting the unique 3-stars gives us a total of [9].
