Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, 7, and node 8

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

Here is a list of unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (1, 6, 8)>
<1, (0, 2, 9)>
<3, (4, 5, 6)>
<4, (3, 5, 9)>
<5, (3, 4, 6)>
<6, (0, 3, 5)>
<9, (1, 4, 8)>

Counting the number of 3-stars found in the given graph, we get a total of [7].
