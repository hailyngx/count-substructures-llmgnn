Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star-like pattern. Since each 3-star has a center node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can identify and count these patterns.

Identifying the 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (6, 8, -)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star: <2, (3, 7, 8)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star: <3, (2, 4, -)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star: <4, (3, 6, 7)>
- Node 5 does not form a 3-star
- Node 6 forms a 3-star: <6, (1, 4, 7)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star: <7, (2, 4, 6)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star: <8, (1, 2, 5)>
- Node 9 does not form a 3-star

Count of 3-stars: [6]

Unique 3-stars:
<1, (6, 8, -)>
<2, (3, 7, 8)>
<3, (2, 4, -)>
<4, (3, 6, 7)>
<6, (1, 4, 7)>
<7, (2, 4, 6)>
