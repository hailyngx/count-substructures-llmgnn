Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are as follows:
<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<0, (1, 3, 7)>
<1, (0, 2, 6)>
<2, (1, 4, 8)>
<4, (0, 2, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
