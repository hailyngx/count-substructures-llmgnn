Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 2

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a center node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Based on the provided information, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (1, 7, 9)>
<1, (0, 7, 9)>
<2, (4, 7, 9)>
<3, (4, 6, 7)>
<4, (2, 3, 5)>
<7, (0, 1, 2)>
<7, (3, 4, 5)>
<7, (6, 8, 0)>
<9, (0, 1, 2)>

Count of 3-stars: [9]
