Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 8

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

From the adjacency list, we can see that the nodes 0, 2, and 8 can act as centers of 3-stars as they each have exactly 3 neighbors.

1. Node 0:
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<0, (1, 2, 6)>
<0, (1, 2, 7)>
<0, (2, 3, 6)>
<0, (2, 6, 7)>

2. Node 2:
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<2, (0, 1, 5)>
<2, (0, 1, 6)>
<2, (1, 3, 5)>
<2, (1, 5, 8)>
<2, (3, 5, 6)>
<2, (5, 6, 8)>

3. Node 8:
<8, (1, 2, 9)>
<8, (2, 3, 9)>
<8, (2, 9, 1)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
