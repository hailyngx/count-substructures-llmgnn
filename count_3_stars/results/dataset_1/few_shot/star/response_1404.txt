Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

In this graph, node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 5. This creates a 3-star centered at node 3. Let's count this 3-star.

The total number of unique 3-stars in this graph: [1]
Unique 3-stars: <3, (2, 4, 5)>
