Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 5
