Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph described:

<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<1, (0, 5, 7)>
<2, (0, 5, 6)>
<3, (4, 6, 9)>
<4, (0, 3, 5)>
<5, (1, 2, 4)>
<6, (2, 3, 5)>
<9, (0, 3, 4)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
