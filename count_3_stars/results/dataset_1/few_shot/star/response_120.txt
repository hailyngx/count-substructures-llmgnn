Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 4

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's determine the 3-stars in this graph:

1. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 5, and 7. <1, (3, 5, 7)>
2. Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 6, and 7. <2, (5, 6, 7)>
3. Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 4, and 8. <3, (1, 4, 8)>
4. Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 2, and 8. <7, (1, 2, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
