Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, 6, and node 7

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 8: <0, (1, 3, 8)>
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 7, and 9: <1, (0, 7, 9)>
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 4 and 9: <2, (4, 5, 6)>
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 6: <3, (0, 4, 6)>
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 5: <4, (2, 3, 5)>
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 4, 6, 8, and 9: <5, (4, 6, 8)>
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 9: <6, (3, 5, 9)>
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 1 and 9: <7, (1, 9)>
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0 and 5: <8, (0, 5, 9)>
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 5, 6, and 7: <9, (1, 2, 5)>

Hence, there are a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
