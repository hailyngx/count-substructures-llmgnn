Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 5, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that serves as the center of a 3-star. A 3-star is formed when a center node is connected to exactly three other nodes in the graph. 

Based on the given information and the definition of a 3-star graph:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 5, 7, 9
  - <0, (2, 5, 7)>
  - <0, (3, 5, 9)>
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 6, 9
  - <2, (0, 6, 9)>
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, 6
  - <3, (0, 4, 6)>
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 3, 6, 9
  - <4, (3, 6, 9)>
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 9
  - <5, (0, 9, 0)>
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, 8
  - <6, (2, 4, 8)>
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 9
  - <7, (0, 9, 0)>
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 6
  - <8, (1, 6, 3)>
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, 5, 7
  - <9, (0, 2, 5)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is equal to the number of unique 3-stars listed above.
