Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 2

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars present. 

Based on the definition provided, a 3-star involves a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the given graph's adjacency list, we can identify the 3-stars:

<0, (1, 9)>
<1, (0, 3, 7)>
<1, (0, 8, 9)>
<1, (3, 7, 8)>
<2, (4, 9)>
<3, (1, 5, 7)>
<3, (1, 7, 8)>
<4, (2)>
<5, (3, 7)>
<7, (1, 3, 5)>
<7, (1, 5, 8)>
<8, (1, 3, 7)>
<8, (1, 7, 6)>
<9, (0, 1, 2)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we find that there are [14] 3-stars in the given graph.
