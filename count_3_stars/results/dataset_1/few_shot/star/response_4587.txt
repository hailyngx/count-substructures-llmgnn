Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 9
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph and to identify them, we first need to understand the definition of a 3-star graph.

A 3-star graph consists of a central node (the center) connected to exactly three other nodes (leaves) by edges.

Given the information provided, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. For each node, check if it is connected to exactly three other nodes.
2. If a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, then it forms a 3-star.
3. Identify the central node and the three leaves for each 3-star.

Let's start with the list of unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<5, (0, 1, 9)>
<3, (2, 4, 7)>
<8, (0, 7, 9)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph: [3].
