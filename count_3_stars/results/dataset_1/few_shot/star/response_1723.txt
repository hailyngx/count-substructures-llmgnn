Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can identify the central node of each 3-star and count how many connected nodes that central node has that are not connected to each other. 

Here is the step-by-step process to count the number of 3-stars in the graph:
1. Identify the central node of each potential 3-star. A node is a potential central node if it has exactly 3 adjacent nodes.
2. For each potential central node, count how many of its adjacent nodes are also connected to each other. If exactly 3 adjacent nodes are connected only to the potential central node and not to each other, it forms a 3-star.
3. Count the total number of unique 3-stars found.

Let's go through the graph provided: 

The potential central nodes with exactly 3 adjacent nodes are nodes 0, 1, and 6.

For node 0:
- Its adjacent nodes are 4 and 6, which are not connected to each other. Hence, <0, (4, 6)> forms a 3-star.

For node 1:
- Its adjacent nodes are 2 and 6, which are not connected to each other. Hence, <1, (2, 6)> forms a 3-star.

For node 6:
- Its adjacent nodes are 0, 1, and 9. However, nodes 0 and 1 are already connected in another 3-star. So, node 6 does not form a 3-star by itself.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (4, 6)>
<1, (2, 6)>
