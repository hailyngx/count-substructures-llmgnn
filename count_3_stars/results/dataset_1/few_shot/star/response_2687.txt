Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 2) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star-like configuration. 

Based on the adjacency list and the given edge information, we can determine the following 3-stars:
<1, (2, 6, 7)>
<2, (1, 3, 4)>
<2, (1, 3, 5)>
<2, (1, 4, 5)>
<3, (2, 6, 1)>
<6, (1, 3, 8)>
<7, (1, 9, 2)>
