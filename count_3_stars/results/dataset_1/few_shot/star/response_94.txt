Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 3

Response:
The 3-star graphs can be identified by finding nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's determine the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 6. So, <0, (1, 5, 6)> is a 3-star.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 5. So, <1, (0, 2, 5)> is a 3-star.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 5. So, <2, (1, 3, 5)> is a 3-star.
4. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 2. So, <5, (0, 1, 2)> is a 3-star.
5. Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 7. So, <6, (0, 1, 7)> is a 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
