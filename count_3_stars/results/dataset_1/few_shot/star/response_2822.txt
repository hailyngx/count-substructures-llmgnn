Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star pattern in the graph. As a 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can look for nodes that satisfy this definition.

Let's list down the unique 3-stars present in the graph:

<0, (2, 4, 7)>
<1, (6, 7, 9)>
<2, (0, 4, 7)>
<3, (0, 8, 9)>
<4, (0, 2, 8)>
<5, (6, 7, 9)>
<6, (1, 5, 8)>
<7, (0, 1, 9)>
<8, (3, 4, 6)>
<9, (1, 3, 5)>

Count of 3-stars: [10]
