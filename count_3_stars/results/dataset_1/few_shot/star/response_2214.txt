Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and node 7

Response:
There are <0, (1, 8, 9)>, <1, (0, 9, 2)>, <2, (3, 6, 9)>, <3, (2, 9, 4)>, <4, (7, 8, 9)>, <5, (6, 8, 9)>, <6, (2, 5, 9)>, <7, (2, 4, 9)>, and <8, (0, 4, 5)>.

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
