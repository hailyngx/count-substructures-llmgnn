Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7)

Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 7

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 5, and 7. This forms a 3-star with Node 0 as the center and nodes 1, 2, 5 as the leaves. (<0, (1, 2, 5)>)
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 7. This forms a 3-star with Node 1 as the center and nodes 0, 3, 7 as the leaves. (<1, (0, 3, 7)>)
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 9. This forms a 3-star with Node 2 as the center and nodes 0, 4, 9 as the leaves. (<2, (0, 4, 9)>)
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 6. This forms a 3-star with Node 3 as the center and nodes 1, 5, 6 as the leaves. (<3, (1, 5, 6)>)
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 6. This forms a 3-star with Node 4 as the center and nodes 2, 5, 6 as the leaves. (<4, (2, 5, 6)>)
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 4. This forms a 3-star with Node 5 as the center and nodes 0, 3, 4 as the leaves. (<5, (0, 3, 4)>)
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 5. This forms a 3-star with Node 6 as the center and nodes 3, 4, 5 as the leaves. (<6, (3, 4, 5)>)
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 8. This forms a 3-star with Node 7 as the center and nodes 0, 1, 8 as the leaves. (<7, (0, 1, 8)>)
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 7. This forms a 3-star with Node 8 as the center and nodes 0, 1, 7 as the leaves. (<8, (0, 1, 7)>)
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 4. This forms a 3-star with Node 9 as the center and nodes 2, 3, 4 as the leaves. (<9, (2, 3, 4)>)

Therefore, there are a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
