Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a star pattern. Here are the steps to find the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Identify nodes with exactly three edges connected:
   - Nodes 0, 7, and 6 have exactly 3 edges connected.

2. For each of these nodes, find the 3-stars they are part of:
   - Node 0: <0, (2, 4, 5)>
   - Node 7: <7, (9, 8, 9)>
   - Node 6: <6, (3, 4, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].

<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<7, (9, 8, 9)>
<6, (3, 4, 6)>
