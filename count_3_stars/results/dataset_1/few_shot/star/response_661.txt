Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 5, and node 6

Response:
Step 1: Identify nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.
Based on the adjacency list provided, nodes 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 9 are connected to exactly three other nodes.

Step 2: For each of these nodes, determine the 3-stars by checking all possible combinations of connections to exactly three other nodes.

For Node 0:
- 3-stars: <0, (2, 3, 5)>, <0, (2, 5, 8)>, <0, (2, 5, 9)>
- Total = 3

For Node 2:
- 3-stars: <2, (0, 3, 5)>, <2, (0, 5, 7)>, <2, (3, 5, 7)>
- Total = 3

For Node 3:
- 3-stars: <3, (0, 2, 7)>, <3, (2, 4, 7)>, <3, (2, 5, 7)>
- Total = 3

For Node 5:
- 3-stars: <5, (0, 1, 9)>, <5, (0, 2, 9)>, <5, (1, 2, 9)>
- Total = 3

For Node 6:
- 3-stars: <6, (7, 8, 9)>
- Total = 1

For Node 9:
- 3-stars: <9, (0, 4, 6)>, <9, (0, 5, 6)>, <9, (1, 4, 6)>, <9, (1, 5, 6)>
- Total = 4

Step 3: Calculate the total number of 3-stars in the graph.
Total 3-stars = 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 1 + 4 = 17
