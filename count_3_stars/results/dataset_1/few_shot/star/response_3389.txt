Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of unique 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible 3-stars based on the definition provided.

Given the graph:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 9
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3 and 9
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 5, 8, and 9
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 6
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 5, and 6
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 7, and 9
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 7
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 5 and 6
- Node 8 is connected to node 2
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, and 5

Now, let's find all the unique 3-stars in this graph:

1. All possible 3-stars centered at Node 0:
<0, (3, 4, 9)>

2. All possible 3-stars centered at Node 1:
<1, (3, 9)>

3. All possible 3-stars centered at Node 2:
<2, (5, 8, 9)>

4. All possible 3-stars centered at Node 3:
<3, (0, 1, 6)>

5. All possible 3-stars centered at Node 4:
<4, (0, 5, 6)>

6. All possible 3-stars centered at Node 5:
<5, (2, 4, 9)>
<5, (4, 6, 7)>

7. All possible 3-stars centered at Node 6:
<6, (3, 4, 7)>

8. All possible 3-stars centered at Node 9:
<9, (0, 1, 5)>
<9, (2, 5, 9)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
