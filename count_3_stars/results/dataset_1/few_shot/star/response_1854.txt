Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 4

Response:
The graph can be visualized as follows: 

          0 --- 4
          |     | \
          |     |  9
          |     | /
          3 --- 4 --- 6 --- 1 --- 8 --- 7 
                  \   |           |
                   \  |           |
                     5 ----------- 
                       2 

Let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph:
1. Node 4 forms a 3-star with leaves 0, 3, and 6. <4, (0, 3, 6)>
2. Node 8 forms a 3-star with leaves 1, 3, and 7. <8, (1, 3, 7)>
