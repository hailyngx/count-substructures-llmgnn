Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that can act as the center of a 3-star in this graph. 
Looking at the adjacency list, we see that nodes 0, 3, 4, and 5 have degree 4 or more, which means they can be the center of a 3-star.

Next, let's enumerate the 3-stars: 
1. <0, (3, 4, 7)>
2. <0, (3, 7, 9)>
3. <1, (4, 5, 7)>
4. <3, (0, 2, 5)>
5. <3, (0, 4, 7)>
6. <3, (2, 5, 8)>
7. <4, (0, 1, 3)>
8. <5, (1, 2, 3)>
9. <6, (5, 7, 8)>
10. <7, (0, 1, 3)>

Therefore, there are [10] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
