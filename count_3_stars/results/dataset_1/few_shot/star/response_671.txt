Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 5, and node 8

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are as follows:
<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<1, (0, 2, 6)>
<2, (0, 1, 8)>
<8, (2, 5, 9)>
<9, (1, 3, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
