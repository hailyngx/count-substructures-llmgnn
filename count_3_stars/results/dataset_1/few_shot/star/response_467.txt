Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
Step 1: Identify all 3-stars in the graph by finding nodes that are connected to exactly 3 other nodes.

When we look at the adjacency list, we can see that nodes 0, 5, and 7 are the only nodes that are connected to exactly 3 other nodes. 

Step 2: List all unique 3-stars identified.

The 3-stars in the graph are:
<0, (2, 5, 7)>
<5, (0, 2, 6)>
<7, (0, 1, 4)>
<7, (4, 6, 0)>
<7, (1, 4, 6)>
<8, (0, 5, 2)>

Step 3: Count the number of unique 3-stars found.

Total number of 3-stars: [6]

Final Answer: [6]
