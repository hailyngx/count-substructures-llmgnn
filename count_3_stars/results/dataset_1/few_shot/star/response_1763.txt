Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 9
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 2

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to understand that a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph step by step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 7, and 8.
    - <0, (5, 6, 7)>
    - <0, (5, 6, 8)>
    - <0, (5, 7, 8)>
    - <0, (6, 7, 8)>

2. Node 4 is connected to nodes 6, 7, and 8.
    - <4, (6, 7, 8)>

3. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0 and 1.
    - <5, (0, 1)>

4. Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 8.
    - <6, (0, 4, 8)>

5. Node 7 is connected to nodes 0 and 4.
    - <7, (0, 4)>

6. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 6.
    - <8, (0, 4, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is: [6].
