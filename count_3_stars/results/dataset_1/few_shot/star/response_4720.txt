Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 5

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars in the given graph. 
A 3-star is formed when a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star-like manner. 

Looking at the adjacency list of each node, we see that the following nodes form 3-stars:
- Node 1: (3, 4, 7)
- Node 7: (1, 2, 4)
- Node 8: (1, 2, 0)

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph.

[3] 
<1, (3, 4, 7)>
<7, (1, 2, 4)>
<8, (1, 2, 0)>
