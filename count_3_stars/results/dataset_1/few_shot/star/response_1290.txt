Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a 3-star pattern.

Here are the 3-stars found in the graph:

[2]
<2, (1, 3, 5)>
<6, (0, 5, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
