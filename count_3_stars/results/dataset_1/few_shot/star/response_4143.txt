Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 4, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 8
