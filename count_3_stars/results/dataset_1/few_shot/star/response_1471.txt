Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 8

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the 3-stars present in the graph.

1. Node 0: (0, 2, 3, 5), (0, 3, 5, 7), (0, 3, 7, 8)
2. Node 1: (1, 3, 5, 7), (1, 3, 6, 7), (1, 3, 7, 8)
3. Node 2: No 3-stars as it's connected to only two other nodes.
4. Node 3: (3, 0, 1, 5), (3, 0, 4, 6), (3, 0, 6, 7), (3, 0, 7, 8)
5. Node 4: No 3-stars as it's connected to only two other nodes.
6. Node 5: No 3-stars as it's connected to only two other nodes.
7. Node 6: No 3-stars as it's connected to only two other nodes.
8. Node 7: No 3-stars as it's connected to only two other nodes.
9. Node 8: (8, 0, 3, 4), (8, 0, 4, 9), (8, 1, 3, 7), (8, 1, 3, 8), (8, 3, 4, 9)
10. Node 9: No 3-stars as it's connected to only two other nodes.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the graph are <0, (2, 3, 5)>, <0, (3, 5, 7)>, <0, (3, 7, 8)>, <1, (3, 5, 7)>, <1, (3, 6, 7)>, <1, (3, 7, 8)>, <3, (0, 1, 5)>, <3, (0, 4, 6)>, <3, (0, 6, 7)>, <3, (0, 7, 8)>, <8, (0, 3, 4)>, <8, (0, 4, 9)>, <8, (1, 3, 7)>, <8, (1, 3, 8)>, <8, (3, 4, 9)>.

Counting the unique 3-stars mentioned above, we have a total of [14] 3-stars in the graph.
