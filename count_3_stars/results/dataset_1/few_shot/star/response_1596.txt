Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 3

Response:
The 3-star structures in the given graph are as follows: 
<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<4, (2, 6, 7)>
<8, (3, 4, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
