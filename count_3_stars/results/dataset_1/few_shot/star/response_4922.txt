Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all possible 3-stars by looking at each node and its neighbors.

Let's list the 3-stars that can be formed in this graph:

<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<1, (4)>
<2, (0, 3, 8)>
<3, (2, 6, 8)>
<4, (0, 1, 6)>
<5, (7, 8)>
<6, (0, 3, 4)>
<7, (5, 6, 8)>
<8, (2, 3, 5)>
<9, (8)>

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars in this graph. 

Total number of 3-stars: [9]
