Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, and node 8

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (3, 7, 1)>
<1, (3, 7, 6)>
<3, (0, 7, 1)>
<4, (2, 8, 9)>
<6, (1, 7, 9)>
<6, (7, 8, 9)>
<9, (4, 5, 6)>
