Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 6) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 6
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star-like pattern.

First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3 and 4 (2 connections).
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0 and 9 (2 connections).
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0 and 7 (2 connections).
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 4 and 8 (2 connections).
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 3 and 5 (2 connections).

Next, we need to check if any of these nodes are part of a 3-star. 

After analyzing the connections, we find that there are no 3-stars in the given graph. 

Therefore, the count of 3-stars in the given graph is [0].
