Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 2

Response:
First, let's find the 3-stars in the graph. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Here is a list of all the 3-stars in the given graph:
<0, (2, 9)> - with central node 0 and leaves 2, 9
<2, (0, 3, 9)> - with central node 2 and leaves 0, 3, 9
<3, (2, 5, 7)> - with central node 3 and leaves 2, 5, 7
<4, (1, 5, 7)> - with central node 4 and leaves 1, 5, 7
<5, (3, 4, 8)> - with central node 5 and leaves 3, 4, 8
<8, (3, 5, 6)> - with central node 8 and leaves 3, 5, 6

So the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
