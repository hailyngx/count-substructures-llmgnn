Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 4
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 0

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern.

Looking at the given graph and adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (1, 7, 9)>
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<4, (2, 3, 5)>
<7, (0, 1, 4)>
<8, (1, 4, 8)>

Therefore, there are [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
