Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify all the possible configurations where a node acts as the center of a 3-star. 

Based on the given graph and definition of a 3-star graph, we can identify the following unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 6, 8)>
<1, (0, 6, 8)>
<6, (0, 1, 3)>
<8, (1, 4, 6)>

Count of 3-stars: [4]
