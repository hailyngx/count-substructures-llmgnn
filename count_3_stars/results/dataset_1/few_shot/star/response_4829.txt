Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Here are the steps to find the answer:

1. Identify nodes connected to exactly three other nodes:
   - Node 1 has a 3-star with nodes 5, 8, and 9: <1, (5, 8, 9)>
   - Node 2 has a 3-star with nodes 4, 5, and 9: <2, (4, 5, 9)>
   - Node 5 has a 3-star with nodes 1, 2, and 9: <5, (1, 2, 9)>
   - Node 8 has a 3-star with nodes 1, 4, and 7: <8, (1, 4, 7)>
   - Node 9 has a 3-star with nodes 1, 2, and 5: <9, (1, 2, 5)>

2. Count the total number of unique 3-stars found:
   - [5]
