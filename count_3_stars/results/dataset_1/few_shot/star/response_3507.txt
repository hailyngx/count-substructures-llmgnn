Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to understand the definition of a 3-star graph. In a 3-star graph, a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Looking at the provided graph, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<1, (0, 4, 7)>
<2, (3, 7, 8)>
<4, (0, 1, 5)>
<4, (0, 5, 6)>
<5, (0, 3, 4)>
<6, (0, 4, 7)>
<7, (0, 1, 6)>
<7, (2, 6, 8)>
<8, (2, 7, 9)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [13]. 
The unique 3-stars found are <0, (1, 4, 5)>, <0, (1, 4, 6)>, <0, (1, 5, 7)>, <0, (4, 5, 6)>, <1, (0, 4, 7)>, <2, (3, 7, 8)>, <4, (0, 1, 5)>, <4, (0, 5, 6)>, <5, (0, 3, 4)>, <6, (0, 4, 7)>, <7, (0, 1, 6)>, <7, (2, 6, 8)>, <8, (2, 7, 9)>.
