Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all possible 3-stars by finding all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list down the possible 3-stars:

<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<0, (2, 5, 9)>
<1, (2, 5, 9)>
<2, (0, 1, 9)>
<2, (8, 4, 9)>
<4, (0, 5, 8)>
<5, (0, 1, 9)>
<5, (4, 0, 7)>
<5, (7, 9, 0)>
<5, (9, 0, 7)>
<8, (2, 3, 4)>
<9, (0, 2, 7)>
<9, (2, 5, 7)>

There are a total of 13 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the final answer is [13].
