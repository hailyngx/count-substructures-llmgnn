Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 2

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes (forming a 3-star).

We will list out the 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (5, 6, 7)>
<0, (5, 7, 9)>
<0, (6, 5, 8)>
<0, (6, 7, 9)>
<1, (7, 0, 9)>
<1, (7, 2, 9)>
<2, (4, 5, 7)>
<2, (4, 7, 9)>
<3, (4, 7, 2)>
<4, (2, 3, 8)>
<5, (0, 2, 6)>
<7, (0, 2, 3)>
<7, (0, 2, 9)>

There are [13] unique 3-stars in the graph.
