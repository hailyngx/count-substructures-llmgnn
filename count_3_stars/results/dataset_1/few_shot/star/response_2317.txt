Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 7, and node 8

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:

[<5, (3, 6, 8)>, <7, (1, 3, 4)>, <7, (3, 4, 6)>, <7, (4, 6, 9)>, <7, (6, 4, 9)>]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
