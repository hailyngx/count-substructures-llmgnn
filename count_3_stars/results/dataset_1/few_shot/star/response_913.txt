Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a 3-star. 

Let's go step by step:

1. Start by identifying nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
   - Node 0 is connected to 4 nodes: 2, 4, 5, 6
   - Node 4 is connected to 3 nodes: 0, 5, 6
   - Node 5 is connected to 4 nodes: 0, 4, 8, 9
   - Node 6 is connected to 4 nodes: 0, 4, 7, 8

2. Now, we need to check if these connections form 3-stars:
   - <0, (2, 4, 5)> is a 3-star.
   - <4, (0, 5, 6)> is a 3-star.
   - <5, (0, 4, 8)> is a 3-star.
   - <6, (0, 4, 8)> is a 3-star.

3. Count the total number of 3-stars found: [4]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
