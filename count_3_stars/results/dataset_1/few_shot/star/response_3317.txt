Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 7

Response:
Let's first identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph. A 3-star graph consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

We can see that nodes 0, 4, and 7 are connected to exactly three other nodes each (nodes 1, 2, 9 for node 0, nodes 3, 5, 9 for node 4, and nodes 1, 5, 7 for node 7). Hence, there are three 3-star graphs in this network. 

Now, let's list the unique 3-star graphs found:
<0, (1, 2, 9)>
<4, (3, 5, 9)>
<7, (1, 5, 9)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
