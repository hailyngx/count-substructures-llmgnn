Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star configuration. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the provided graph, the number of 3-stars can be determined by examining each node and its connections to other nodes:

Possible 3-star configurations:
<0, (4, 8)>
<1, (2, 4, 8)>
<2, (1, 7, 8)>
<3, (6, 7, 8)>
<4, (0, 1)>
<7, (2, 3)>
<8, (0, 1, 2), (0, 1, 3), (0, 2, 3), (1, 2, 3)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we get [7]. 

Therefore, the final answer is [7].
