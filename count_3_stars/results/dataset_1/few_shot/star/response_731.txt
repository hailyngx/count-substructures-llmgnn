Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 1

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the nodes that act as the center of a 3-star. Since a 3-star has a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can look for nodes with three neighbors.

From the adjacency list, we can see that nodes 2, 4, 5, and 6 have exactly three neighbors. Let's find the 3-stars centered at these nodes:
- For Node 2: (2, 1, 6), (2, 3, 4), (2, 5, 7)
- For Node 4: (4, 0, 6), (4, 2, 3), (4, 6, 7)
- For Node 5: (5, 0, 6), (5, 2, 3), (5, 6, 8)
- For Node 6: (6, 0, 1), (6, 4, 7), (6, 5, 7)

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7] and the unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (1, 6, 2)>, <2, (3, 4, 2)>, <2, (5, 7, 2)>, <4, (0, 6, 4)>, <4, (2, 3, 4)>, <4, (6, 7, 4)>, <5, (0, 6, 5)>, <5, (2, 3, 5)>, <5, (6, 8, 5)>, <6, (0, 1, 6)>, <6, (4, 7, 6)>, <6, (5, 7, 6)>.
