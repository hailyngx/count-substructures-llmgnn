Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars in the graph. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we can see that the possible central nodes for 3-stars are nodes 1, 4, 5, 8, and 9 because these nodes are connected to exactly three other nodes.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<1, (4, 8, 5)>
<4, (1, 8, 5)>
<5, (0, 4, 8)>
<8, (1, 4, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
