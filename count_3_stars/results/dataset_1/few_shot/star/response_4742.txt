Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 9
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 4

Response:
Let's first identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph:

From the adjacency list:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 4, and 9: <0, (3, 4, 9)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 7, and 9: <4, (0, 7, 9)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 4, and 5: <7, (2, 4, 5)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 7, and 9: <8, (4, 7, 9)>

Count of 3-stars: [4]
