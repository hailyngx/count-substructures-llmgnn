Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 9
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 6

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with 3 edges connected to them, as these nodes can be the centers of 3-star graphs:

- Node 2 has 3 edges connected to nodes 4, 5, and 9.
- Node 5 has 3 edges connected to nodes 2, 8, and 9.
- Node 8 has 4 edges connected to nodes 4, 5, 6, and 7.
- Node 9 has 4 edges connected to nodes 0, 2, 5, and 6.

Next, we can construct the 3-star graphs using these nodes as centers:

<2, (4, 5, 9)>
<5, (2, 8, 9)>
<8, (4, 5, 6)>
<9, (0, 2, 5)>

Thus, there are [4] 3-star graphs in the given graph.
