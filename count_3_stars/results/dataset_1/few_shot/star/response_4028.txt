Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5, and node 6

Response:
There are <0, (2, 5, 7)> and <5, (0, 1, 9)> as the only 2 unique 3-star patterns. 
Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
