Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the 3-stars based on the definition provided. 

From the adjacency list, we can see that the nodes are connected as follows:
- Node 0: 9
- Node 1: 7
- Node 2: 4, 6, 9
- Node 3: 6, 9
- Node 4: 2, 7
- Node 5: Not connected to any other nodes
- Node 6: 2, 3, 9
- Node 7: 1, 4
- Node 8: Not connected to any other nodes
- Node 9: 0, 2, 3, 6

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph.

[3]

<2, (4, 7, 9)>
<2, (6, 3, 9)>
<4, (2, 6, 9)>
