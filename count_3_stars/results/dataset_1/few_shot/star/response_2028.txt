Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 2

Response:
The 3-star graph consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's find all the 3-stars in the given graph.

From the adjacency list:
- Node 0 has two 3-stars: <0, (1, 4, 6)> and <0, (1, 4, 6)>
- Node 1 has one 3-star: <1, (0, 2, 5)>
- Node 2 has two 3-stars: <2, (1, 5, 7)> and <2, (1, 5, 9)>
- Node 3 has one 3-star: <3, (5, 6, 0)>
- Node 4 has no 3-stars
- Node 5 has four 3-stars: <5, (1, 2, 8)>, <5, (1, 2, 8)>, <5, (1, 3, 6)>, and <5, (1, 3, 6)>
- Node 6 has one 3-star: <6, (0, 3, 5)>
- Node 7 has no 3-stars
- Node 8 has no 3-stars
- Node 9 has no 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9]. 

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<1, (0, 2, 5)>
<2, (1, 5, 7)>
<2, (1, 5, 9)>
<3, (5, 6, 0)>
<5, (1, 2, 8)>
<5, (1, 3, 6)>
