Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through each node and its connections to find all 3-stars.

    Node 0: Not a part of any 3-star.
    Node 1: Not a part of any 3-star.

    Node 2: Not a part of any 3-star.

    Node 3: <3, (1, 4, 8)>, <3, (4, 0, 9)>
    
    Node 4: <4, (0, 3, 5)>, <4, (3, 1, 8)>, <4, (5, 1, 9)>
    
    Node 5: <5, (1, 4, 9)>, <5, (4, 0, 3)>
    
    Node 6: Not a part of any 3-star.

    Node 7: Not a part of any 3-star.
    
    Node 8: Not a part of any 3-star.

    Node 9: Not a part of any 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6]. The unique 3-stars are <3, (1, 4, 8)>, <3, (4, 0, 9)>, <4, (0, 3, 5)>, <4, (3, 1, 8)>, <4, (5, 1, 9)>, and <5, (1, 4, 9)>.
