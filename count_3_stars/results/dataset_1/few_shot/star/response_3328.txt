Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 8

Response:
Step 1: Count the number of 3-stars by examining each node (candidates for center of 3-star).
- Node 0: (0, 2, 4, 5) forms a 3-star.
- Node 1: (1, 2, 3) does not form a 3-star.
- Node 2: (2, 0, 1, 3) forms a 3-star.
- Node 3: (3, 1, 2, 4) forms a 3-star.
- Node 4: (4, 0, 2, 3) forms a 3-star.
- Node 5: (5, 0, 3, 4) forms a 3-star.
- Node 6: (6, 3, 5, 7) does not form a 3-star.
- Node 7: (7, 2, 3, 4) forms a 3-star.
- Node 8: (8, 0, 2, 9) does not form a 3-star.
- Node 9: (9, 8) does not form a 3-star.

Step 2: Identify unique 3-stars.
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<3, (1, 2, 4)>
<4, (0, 2, 3)>
<5, (0, 3, 4)>
<7, (2, 3, 4)>
