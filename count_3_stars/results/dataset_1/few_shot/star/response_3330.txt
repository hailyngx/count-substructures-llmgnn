Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star, which consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes. We will list all possible 3-stars below and then count the total number of unique 3-stars.

Possible 3-stars:
<0, (1, 8),  (8, 1)>
<1, (0, 2, 6), (2, 1, 6), (6, 1, 2)>
<2, (1, 6, 7), (6, 1, 7), (7, 1, 6)>
<3, (4, 5, 6), (4, 6, 5), (5, 6, 4)>
<4, (3, 6, 8), (6, 3, 8), (8, 3, 6)>
<5, (3, 6, 7), (6, 3, 7), (7, 3, 6)>
<6, (1, 2, 4), (1, 4, 2), (2, 4, 1)>
<7, (2, 5, 8), (5, 2, 8), (8, 2, 5)>
<8, (0, 4, 7), (4, 0, 7), (7, 0, 4)>

Total number of 3-stars: [8]
