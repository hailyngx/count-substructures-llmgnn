Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 1) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars in it. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the adjacency list provided for each node, we can start by listing the 3-stars we find:

<1, (2, 3, 5)>
<5, (1, 2, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
