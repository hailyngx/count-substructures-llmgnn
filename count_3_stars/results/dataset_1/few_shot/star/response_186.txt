Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 2

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can first identify the central nodes (nodes with exactly 3 neighbors) and then check if they form a 3-star structure with their neighbors.

From the adjacency list, we can determine the central nodes:
- Node 0 (neighbors: 1, 4, 5)
- Node 1 (neighbors: 0, 3, 4)
- Node 2 (neighbors: 3, 5, 9)
- Node 5 (neighbors: 0, 2, 7)

Let's now list the unique 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<2, (3, 5, 9)>
<5, (0, 2, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
