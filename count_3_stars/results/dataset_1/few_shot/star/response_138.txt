Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 4

Response:
The 3-star graphs can be identified based on the definition of a 3-star, where each 3-star has a center node connected to exactly three other nodes. Given the information provided, we need to explore all possible combinations of 3-star graphs within the given graph.

Let's list down the possible 3-star graphs based on the provided information:
<0, (8, 9)>
<1, (3, 8, 9)>
<2, (6, 7)>
<3, (1, 4, 8)>
<4, (3, 7, 9)>
<5, (7, 8)>
<7, (2, 4, 5)>
<8, (0, 1, 3, 5, 7)>
<9, (0, 3, 4)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars found, we get a total of [9] 3-stars.
