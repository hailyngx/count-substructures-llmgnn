Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Here are the steps:

1. Identify all nodes that have exactly three neighbors:
   - Node 0 (neighbors: 1, 2, 4)
   - Node 1 (neighbors: 0, 3, 5)
   - Node 2 (neighbors: 0, 3, 4)
   - Node 3 (neighbors: 1, 2, 6)
   - Node 4 (neighbors: 0, 2, 5) and (neighbors: 6, 7, 8)
   - Node 6 (neighbors: 3, 4, 8)
   - Node 7 (neighbors: 0, 3, 9)
   - Node 8 (neighbors: 0, 2, 6)
   - Node 9 (neighbors: 0, 1, 7)

2. For each node found in step 1, check if it forms a 3-star by counting the number of 3-stars it is a part of.

Count of 3-stars in the graph: [4]

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<1, (0, 3, 5)>
<3, (1, 2, 6)>
<7, (0, 4, 9)>
