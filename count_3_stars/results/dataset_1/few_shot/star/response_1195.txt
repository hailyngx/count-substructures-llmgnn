Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node:

Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 5, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star in the graph. 

Let's break down the process step-by-step:

1. For each node in the graph, we will check if it is the central node of a 3-star. 
2. If a node has exactly 3 neighbors, we will check if these neighbors are connected to each other. If they are, then we have found a 3-star.
3. We will continue this process for all nodes in the graph.

Identifying 3-stars:
- Node 0: Not a central node of a 3-star.
- Node 1: Not a central node of a 3-star.
- Node 2: Not a central node of a 3-star.
- Node 3: Not a central node of a 3-star.
- <4, (0, 5, 6, 8)>  (as node 4 is connected to nodes 5 and 6, and node 5 and 6 are connected)
- Node 5: Not a central node of a 3-star.
- Node 6: Not a central node of a 3-star.
- Node 7: Not a central node of a 3-star.
- <8, (0, 4, 5, 6)>  (as node 8 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 6, and 4, 5, 6 are connected)
- Node 9: Not a central node of a 3-star.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
The unique 3-star configurations are: <4, (0, 5, 6, 8)>, <8, (0, 4, 5, 6)>
