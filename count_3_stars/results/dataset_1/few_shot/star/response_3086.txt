Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 8

Response:
Let's find the number of 3-stars in this graph.

1. Identify the nodes connected to each node:
- Node 0 has neighbors 1, 3, 8
- Node 1 has neighbors 0, 6, 7
- Node 2 has neighbors 4, 7, 9
- Node 3 has neighbors 0, 4
- Node 4 has neighbors 2, 3
- Node 5 has neighbors 6, 7, 8
- Node 6 has neighbors 1, 5
- Node 7 has neighbors 1, 2, 5
- Node 8 has neighbors 0, 5, 9
- Node 9 has neighbors 2, 8

2. For each node, find if it forms a 3-star with its neighbors:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star: <0, (1, 3, 8)>
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star: <1, (0, 6, 7)>
- Node 2 does not form a 3-star.
- Node 3 does not form a 3-star.
- Node 4 does not form a 3-star.
- Node 5 forms 2 3-stars: <5, (6, 7, 8)>, <5, (7, 1, 5)>
- Node 6 does not form a 3-star.
- Node 7 does not form a 3-star.
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star: <8, (0, 5, 9)>
- Node 9 does not form a 3-star.

3. Count the total number of 3-stars:
Total 3-stars: 5

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
Unique 3-stars in the graph: <0, (1, 3, 8)>, <1, (0, 6, 7)>, <5, (6, 7, 8)>, <5, (7, 1, 5)>, <8, (0, 5, 9)>
