Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 5

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star configuration. 

By observing the adjacency list, we can see that the nodes 2, 3, 6, and 8 have degree 3, making them potential central nodes for 3-stars. Let's examine each possibility:

1. For node 2:
<2, (1, 8, 9)>
<2, (1, 6, 8)>
<2, (6, 8, 9)>

2. For node 3:
<3, (4, 5, 6)>
<3, (4, 6, 8)>
<3, (6, 8, 7)>

3. For node 6:
<6, (0, 3, 7)>
<6, (2, 3, 7)>
<6, (3, 7, 8)>

4. For node 8:
<8, (1, 2, 7)>
<8, (1, 7, 9)>
<8, (2, 7, 3)>
<8, (3, 7, 4)>

Therefore, the unique 3-star configurations are:
<2, (1, 8, 9)>, <2, (1, 6, 8)>, <2, (6, 8, 9)>, <3, (4, 5, 6)>, <3, (4, 6, 8)>, <3, (6, 8, 7)>, <6, (0, 3, 7)>, <6, (2, 3, 7)>, <6, (3, 7, 8)>, <8, (1, 2, 7)>, <8, (1, 7, 9)>, <8, (2, 7, 3)>, <8, (3, 7, 4)>

Since we have found a total of 13 unique 3-stars in the graph, the final answer is [13].
