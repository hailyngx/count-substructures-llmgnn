Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 5

Response:
After examining the given graph with 10 nodes and 24 edges, the 3-stars can be identified as follows:
There are a total of [6] 3-stars in the graph.

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 7, 9)>
<2, (0, 5, 9)>
<3, (1, 7, 0)>
<4, (6, 7, 0)>
<5, (2, 9, 0)>
<6, (4, 7, 0)>
