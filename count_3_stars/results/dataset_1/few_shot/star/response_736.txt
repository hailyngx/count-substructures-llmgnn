Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 6

Response:
Let's find all the 3-stars in the given graph:

- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 6, and 7: <0, (5, 6, 7)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 6, and 9: <1, (4, 6, 9)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 5, and 8: <2, (3, 5, 8)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 4, and 6: <3, (2, 4, 6)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, and 5: <4, (1, 3, 5)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 2, and 4: <5, (0, 2, 4)>
- Node 6 forms two 3-stars: <6, (0, 1, 3)> and <6, (5, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
