Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 5, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star. 

Looking at the adjacency list provided, we can determine the following 3-stars:

<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<1, (0, 2, 8)>
<2, (0, 1, 9)>
<3, (1, 8, 9)>
<4, (5, 8, 9)>
<5, (0, 4, 9)>
<6, (2, 7)>
<7, (1, 2, 6)>
<8, (1, 3, 4)>
<9, (2, 3, 4)>

Therefore, there are 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The final answer is [10].
