Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes (forming a 3-star pattern).

Let's list all the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (1, 8, 9)>
<1, (0, 6, 8)>
<2, (6, 7, 9)>
<3, (4, 8, -)>
<4, (3, 6, 7)>
<5, (6, 8, -)>
<6, (1, 2, 4)>
<7, (2, 4, 6)>
<8, (0, 1, 3)>
<9, (0, 2, 6)>

Count of 3-stars in the graph: [10]
