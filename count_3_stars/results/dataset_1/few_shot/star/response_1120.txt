Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 6, and node 7

Response:
The graph can be visualized as follows:
```
 1 -- 5
 |     
 0 -- 4
 |  \  |
 8    2
     /  |
    6 - 9
   / \
  3   7
```

To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list the unique 3-stars:
<0, (4, 2, 3)>
<0, (4, 2, 6)>
<0, (4, 3, 6)>
<4, (0, 2, 3)>
<4, (0, 2, 6)>
<4, (0, 3, 6)>
<2, (4, 6, 8)>
<3, (4, 6, 7)>
<6, (2, 3, 9)>
<7, (3, 5, 9)>

Count of 3-stars: [9]
