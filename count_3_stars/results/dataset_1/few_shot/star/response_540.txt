Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify all the 3-stars in the graph based on the definition provided.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (2, 5, 7)>
<1, (3, 8, 6)>
<2, (0, 3, 9)>
<3, (1, 2, 5)>
<5, (0, 3, 7)>
<6, (4, 8, 1)>
<7, (5, 9, 0)>
<8, (1, 6, 3)>
<9, (2, 7, 0)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the given graph.
