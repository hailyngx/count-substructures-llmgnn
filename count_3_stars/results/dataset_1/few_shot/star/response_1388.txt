Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 4

Response:
First, let's identify the central node of each 3-star. We look for nodes with exactly 3 neighbors.

Nodes that fit this criteria are: 1, 3, 5.

Next, for each central node, we check if it is connected to exactly 3 other nodes.

For central node 1:
- (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5) form a 3-star with 1 as the center.
<1, (3, 4, 5)>

For central node 3:
- (3, 1), (3, 5) do not form a 3-star with 3 as the center because they are not unique 3-star configurations.

For central node 5:
- (5, 1), (5, 3) do not form a 3-star with 5 as the center because they are not unique 3-star configurations.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1]. 
The unique 3-star found is <1, (3, 4, 5)>.
