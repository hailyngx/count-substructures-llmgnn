Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 8
