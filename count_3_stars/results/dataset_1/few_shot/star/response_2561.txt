Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the 3-stars present. Recall that a 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's first list out all the 3-stars we can find in the graph:

<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<3, (0, 1, 8)>
<4, (0, 1, 8)>
<6, (0, 1, 7)>
<7, (1, 3, 9)>
<8, (0, 3, 4)>
<9, (4, 7)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph: [8].
