Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, and node 7

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern.

Observing the graph:
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 7, forming a 3-star with center at node 6. This gives us <6, (1, 3, 7)>.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 9, forming another 3-star with center at node 7. This gives us <7, (0, 3, 9)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
