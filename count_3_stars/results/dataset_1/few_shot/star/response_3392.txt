Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 0) (7, 2) (8, 4) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 3

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars in the given graph.

Nodes with three connections:
- Node 0 (connected to nodes 2, 5, 6)
- Node 2 (connected to nodes 0, 4, 7)
- Node 4 (connected to nodes 1, 2, 8)

Now we can count the number of 3-stars in the graph. Let's list them down:
1. <0, (2, 5, 6)>
2. <0, (2, 5, 6)> (repeated for completeness)
3. <0, (2, 6, 5)> (repeated for completeness)
4. <0, (5, 2, 6)> (repeated for completeness)
5. <0, (5, 6, 2)> (repeated for completeness)
6. <0, (6, 2, 5)> (repeated for completeness)
7. <0, (6, 5, 2)> (repeated for completeness)
8. <2, (0, 4, 7)>
9. <2, (4, 0, 7)>
10. <4, (1, 2, 8)>

Therefore, there are [10] 3-stars in total.
