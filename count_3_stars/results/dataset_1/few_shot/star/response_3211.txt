Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through the nodes one by one:

- Node 0 forms one 3-star: <0, (2, 4, 5)>
- Node 2 forms one 3-star: <2, (0, 6, 7)>
- Node 6 forms four 3-stars:
  - <6, (0, 2, 3)>
  - <6, (0, 5, 8)>
  - <6, (0, 7, 9)>
  - <6, (3, 5, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
