Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 6, 7, and node 8

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph step by step:

1. First, let's identify the nodes that have exactly three neighbors:
- Node 4 has neighbors 2, 7, and 8.
- Node 8 has neighbors 4, 6, and 7.

2. Next, we need to check if these pairs of nodes form 3-stars. A 3-star is formed when one node (center) is connected to exactly three other nodes (leaves).

- For node 4:
    - <4, (2, 7, 8)> forms a 3-star.
    - <4, (2, 8, 7)> is the same 3-star, so we only count it once.

- For node 8:
    - <8, (4, 6, 7)> forms a 3-star.
    - <8, (6, 7, 4)> is the same 3-star, so we only count it once.

3. Finally, we count the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph. In this case, there are 2 unique 3-stars.

Therefore, the final answer is [2].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <4, (2, 7, 8)>
- <8, (4, 6, 7)>
