Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all the unique instances where a node is the central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Let's list the 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (1, 8, 8)>
<1, (0, 8, 8)>
<2, (7, 7, 9)>
<4, (3, 9, 7)>
<5, (6, 7, 8)>
<7, (2, 5, 9)>
<8, (0, 1, 5)>
<9, (4, 7, 7)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
