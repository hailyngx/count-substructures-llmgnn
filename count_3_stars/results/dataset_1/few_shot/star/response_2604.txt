Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 5, 7, and node 8

Response:
Given the graph information provided, the 3-star graphs can be found as follows: 

<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<0, (4, 5, 7)>
<0, (4, 5, 9)>
<0, (4, 6, 7)>
<0, (4, 6, 9)>
<0, (4, 7, 9)>
<0, (5, 8, 9)>
<0, (6, 7, 8)>
<4, (0, 3, 5)>
<4, (0, 5, 7)>
<4, (0, 5, 9)>
<4, (0, 7, 9)>
<4, (3, 5, 9)>
<4, (5, 7, 9)>
<4, (7, 9, 0)>
<5, (0, 4, 8)>
<5, (4, 7, 9)>
<5, (0, 4, 9)>
<5, (4, 0, 9)>
<5, (4, 0, 7)>
<5, (4, 9, 7)>
<5, (4, 8, 0)>
<5, (9, 7, 0)>
<6, (0, 7, 8)>
<7, (0, 4, 6)>
<7, (0, 4, 9)>
<7, (0, 6, 8)>
<7, (4, 6, 0)>
<7, (4, 6, 9)>
<8, (2, 5, 9)>
<9, (0, 4, 5)>
<9, (0, 4, 7)>
<9, (0, 5, 7)>
<9, (0, 7, 4)>

So, the total number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [33].
