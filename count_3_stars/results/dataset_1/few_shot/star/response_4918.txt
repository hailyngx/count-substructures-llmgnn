Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (8, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 6

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the given graph. 

The 3-star patterns can be found by looking at each node and its neighbors. Nodes with exactly three neighbors form the center of a 3-star. After identifying all such nodes, we can list the unique 3-stars.

From the adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars:
1. Node 1: (0, 3, 4)
2. Node 3: (0, 1, 6)
3. Node 6: (1, 3, 5)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].

Unique 3-stars: 
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<3, (0, 1, 6)>
<6, (1, 3, 5)>
