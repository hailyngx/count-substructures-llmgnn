Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 9
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 6
