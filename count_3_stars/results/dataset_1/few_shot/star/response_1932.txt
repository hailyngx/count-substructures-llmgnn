Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's find them step by step.

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1 and 3. Since it is connected to exactly two nodes, it cannot form a 3-star.

2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 6. This forms a 3-star with node 1 as the center and nodes 0, 2, and 6 as the leaves. <1, (0, 2, 6)>

3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 1 and 8. Since it is connected to exactly two nodes, it cannot form a 3-star.

4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0 and 7. Since it is connected to exactly two nodes, it cannot form a 3-star.

5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 6 and 7. Since it is connected to exactly two nodes, it cannot form a 3-star.

6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 7 and 9. Since it is connected to exactly two nodes, it cannot form a 3-star.

7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 8. This forms a 3-star with node 6 as the center and nodes 1, 4, and 8 as the leaves. <6, (1, 4, 8)>

8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 5, and 8. This forms two 3-stars: one with node 7 as the center and nodes 3, 4, and 8 as the leaves <7, (3, 4, 8)>, and another with node 7 as the center and nodes 4, 5, and 8 as the leaves <7, (4, 5, 8)>.

9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 6, and 7. This forms a 3-star with node 8 as the center and nodes 2, 6, and 7 as the leaves. <8, (2, 6, 7)>

10. Node 9 is connected to node 5. Since it is connected to exactly one node, it cannot form a 3-star.

Count of 3-stars: [4]
3-stars: <1, (0, 2, 6)>, <6, (1, 4, 8)>, <7, (3, 4, 8)>, <7, (4, 5, 8)>
