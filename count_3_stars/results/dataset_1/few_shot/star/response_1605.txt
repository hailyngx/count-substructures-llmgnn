Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 4

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star configurations in the given graph. 
A 3-star will have a center connected to exactly three other nodes.
Let's list all the 3-star configurations found in the graph:

<1, (0, 2, 6)>
<2, (1, 8, 9)>
<5, (4, 7, 8)>
<8, (2, 5, 7)>
<9, (2, 4)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph:
[5]
