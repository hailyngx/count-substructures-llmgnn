Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we must identify all possible instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges, forming a 3-star structure.

Here are the 3-stars present in the graph:

[3]
<4, (0, 1, 5)>
<6, (2, 4, 8)>
<9, (1, 3, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
