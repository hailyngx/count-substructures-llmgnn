Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a 3-star pattern.

Let's list the 3-stars found in the given graph:
<0, (2, 7, 8)>
<1, (3, 7, 9)>
<1, (3, 4, 9)>
<3, (1, 4, 6)>
<6, (3, 5, 8)>
<6, (7, 5, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
