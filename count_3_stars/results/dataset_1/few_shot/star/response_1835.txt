Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 8

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible 3-star patterns. Since a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can look for nodes in the graph that are connected to exactly three neighbors.

By examining the adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<1, (0, 3, 6)>
<2, (0, 5, 8)>
<3, (1, 5, 0)>
<4, (0, 1, 6)>
<5, (2, 3, 6)>
<6, (1, 4, 5)>
<7, (0, 1, 5)>
<8, (0, 2, 5)>
<9, (8)>

There are a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph. 
Therefore, the final answer is [10].
