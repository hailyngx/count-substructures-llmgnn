Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 4) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the unique 3-stars present. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (3, 4, 9)>
<3, (0, 6, 7)>
<4, (0, 1, 8)>
<8, (3, 4, 6)>

Now, we count the total number of unique 3-stars found inside brackets []:
[4]
