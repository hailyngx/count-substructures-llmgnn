Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
