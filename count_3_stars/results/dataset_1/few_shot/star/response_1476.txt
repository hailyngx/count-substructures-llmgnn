Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 7
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible configurations where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Upon examining the graph, we find the following 3-stars:
<0, (4, 7, 9)>
<1, (4, 7, -)>
<4, (0, 1, 8)>
<7, (0, 1, -)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
