Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 7, and node 8

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Based on the adjacency list provided, the 3-star configurations are as follows:
<0, (3, 8, 9)>
<1, (8, 9, 7)>
<2, (3, 6, 9)>
<3, (0, 2, 8)>
<8, (0, 1, 3)>
<9, (0, 1, 2)>

Counting the unique 3-stars in the graph, we have identified 6 different configurations. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
