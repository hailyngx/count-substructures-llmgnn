Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the 3-stars based on the definition provided. 

Observations:
1. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.
2. We need to find all possible combinations where a node has exactly 3 neighbors, forming a 3-star.

Based on the adjacency list provided, each node and its neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {1, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 2: {8}
- Node 3: {7, 8}
- Node 4: {5, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 5: {1, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 6: {0, 4, 5}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 3, 4, 5}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 3, 4}
- Node 9: {0}

Now, let's list all the unique 3-stars in the graph: 
<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<0, (1, 7, 9)>
<1, (0, 5, 7)>
<4, (5, 6, 7)>
<5, (1, 4, 6)>
<7, (0, 1, 3)>

Count of 3-stars: [6]
