Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all the instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Let's identify the 3-stars step by step:

1. 3-stars with the central node as node 1:
   a. <1, (3, 4, 6)>
   b. <1, (3, 4, 8)>
   c. <1, (3, 6, 4)>
   d. <1, (4, 6, 9)>
   
2. 3-stars with the central node as node 4:
   a. <4, (0, 1, 6)>
   b. <4, (0, 1, 7)>
   c. <4, (0, 6, 1)>
   d. <4, (1, 6, 9)>
   
3. 3-stars with the central node as node 6:
   a. <6, (1, 4, 9)>
   
Count of 3-stars in the given graph: [8]  
[List of unique 3-stars: <1, (3, 4, 6)>, <1, (3, 4, 8)>, <1, (4, 6, 9)>, <4, (0, 1, 6)>, <4, (0, 1, 7)>, <4, (1, 6, 9)>, <6, (1, 4, 9)>]
