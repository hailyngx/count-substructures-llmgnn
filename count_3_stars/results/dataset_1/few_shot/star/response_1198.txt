Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes in a star pattern. Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

<1, (2, 5, 6)>
<2, (1, 5, 6)>
<5, (1, 2, 9)>
<6, (1, 2, 9)>
