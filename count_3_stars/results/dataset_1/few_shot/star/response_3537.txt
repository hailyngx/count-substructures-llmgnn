Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list the 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (2, 3, 7)>
<1, (3, 5, 8)>
<3, (0, 1, 5)>
<3, (5, 6, 9)>

Count = [4]
