Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 5

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are part of 3-stars. A node is part of a 3-star if it has 3 edges connected to it. We can see from the adjacency list that nodes 0, 1, 4, and 8 satisfy this condition. 

Now, we need to check for each of these nodes, how many 3-stars they are part of. We'll list them as we find them:

1. Node 0: 
    - <0, (1, 3, 8)>
    [1]

2. Node 1:
    - <1, (0, 5, 7)>
    [1]

3. Node 4:
    - <4, (3, 5, 8)>
    - <4, (5, 6, 7)>
    [2]

4. Node 8:
    - <8, (0, 2, 4)>
    - <8, (4, 6, 7)>
    [2]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
