Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star configuration.

Looking at the graph described and the adjacency list provided, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (1, 7, 9)>
<2, (3, 4, 7)>
<7, (0, 2, 9)>
<9, (0, 3, 5)>
