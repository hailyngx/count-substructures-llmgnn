Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern with the central node at the center. 

Based on the given information, the 3-stars in this graph are:
<1, (5, 9, 2)>
<3, (2, 7, 6)>
<7, (3, 9, 6)>
<9, (1, 2, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
