Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 5
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the unique instances of 3-stars in the graph.

Looking at the adjacency list given, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (3, 6)>
<1, (5, 7, 9)>
<5, (1, 7, 9)>
<7, (5, 8, 9)>
<8, (4, 7, 9)>
<9, (5, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].


So, the final answer is [6].
