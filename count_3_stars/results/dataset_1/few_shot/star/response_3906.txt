Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 8

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify sets of nodes that form 3-stars. 

Let's list down the 3-stars in the graph: 
<0, (3, 5, 7)>
<1, (2, 5, 9)>
<5, (0, 1, 7)>
<9, (1, 3, 8)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph. Remember that each 3-star has one central node and three leaves.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
