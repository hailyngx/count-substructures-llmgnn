Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 6

Response:
Given the graph, we can see that there are three 3-star patterns. Let's break it down step-by-step to count the number of 3-stars.

First, let's identify the unique 3-star patterns:
1. Node 0 is the center with nodes 2, 3, and 5 as the leaves: <0, (2, 3, 5)>
2. Node 1 is the center with nodes 2, 4, and 8 as the leaves: <1, (2, 4, 8)>
3. Node 8 is the center with nodes 0, 1, and 5 as the leaves: <8, (0, 1, 5)>

Finally, counting the number of unique 3-stars, we get the total count as [3].
