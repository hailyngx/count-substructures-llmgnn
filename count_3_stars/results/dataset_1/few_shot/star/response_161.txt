Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to understand that a 3-star is formed by a center node connected to exactly three other nodes (leaves) by edges.

To find the 3-stars, we will examine each node in the graph to see if it is the center of a 3-star. For a node to be the center of a 3-star, it must have exactly three neighbors.

Analyzing each node's neighborhood, we identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<1, (0, 5, 8)>
<5, (1, 2, 8)>
<6, (0, 4, 9)>
<7, (0, 2, 9)>
<8, (1, 5, 9)>
<9, (1, 3, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
