Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 7
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the unique 3-stars. 

Looking at the adjacency list for each node, we can see that there are multiple 3-stars in this graph. Let's list them:

<0, (2, 4, 8)>
<1, (4, 9, 1)>
<2, (0, 4, 8)>
<3, (9, 3, 9)>
<4, (0, 1, 2)>
<6, (7, 8, 9)>
<7, (4, 6, 9)>
<8, (0, 2, 6)>
<9, (1, 3, 7)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we get a total of [9].
