Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph, we need to identify all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a 3-star pattern.

Here are the unique 3-star graphs found in the given graph:

<0, (1, 7, 8)>
<1, (0, 7, 9)>
<2, (0, 3, 4)>
<3, (2, 4, 7)>
<4, (0, 3, 5)>
<5, (4, 9, -)>
<7, (0, 1, 3)>
<8, (0, 7, -)>
<9, (1, 5, -)>

Count of 3-star graphs: [9]
