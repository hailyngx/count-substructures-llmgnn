Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 1

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph: [3]

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (2, 3, 9)>
<1, (2, 9, 0)>
<2, (0, 1, 5)>
