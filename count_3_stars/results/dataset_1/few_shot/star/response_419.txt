Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, 6, and node 8

Response:
First, let's find all the 3-stars in the given graph.

We can see that the nodes which are connected to exactly 3 other nodes are: 0, 4, and 8. These nodes will serve as the centers of the 3-stars.

For each of these center nodes, let's identify the 3-stars they are a part of:
1. Node 0: <0, (5, 6, 7)>
2. Node 4: <4, (5, 7, not connected)>
3. Node 8: <8, (1, 9, not connected)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (5, 6, 7)>
<4, (5, 7, not connected)>
<8, (1, 9, not connected)>
