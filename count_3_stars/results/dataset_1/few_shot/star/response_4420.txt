Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 6, 7, and node 8

Response:
First, we can identify the central nodes, which are the nodes that have exactly 3 neighbors. 
From the adjacency list:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors
- Node 3 has 1 neighbor
- Node 5 has 1 neighbor

Therefore, the central nodes are: 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9.

Next, we can look at each central node and count the number of 3-stars they are part of:

For central node 2:
- (2, 1, 7)
- (2, 4, 6)
- (2, 8, 9) 

<2, (1, 7, 4), (6, 4, 2), (9, 8, 2)>

For central node 4:
- (4, 2, 6)
- (4, 6, 9)

<4, (2, 6, 9)>

For central node 6:
- (6, 2, 4)
- (6, 4, 9)
- (6, 5, 9)

<6, (2, 4, 6), (4, 6, 9), (5, 6, 9)>

For central node 7:
- (7, 1, 8)
- (7, 8, 9)

<7, (1, 8, 7), (8, 9, 7)>

For central node 8:
- (8, 2, 7)
- (8, 3, 9)

<8, (2, 7, 8), (3, 8, 9)>

For central node 9:
- (9, 2, 8)
- (9, 4, 6)
- (9, 7, 8)

<9, (2, 8, 9), (4, 6, 9), (7, 8, 9)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars gives us a total of []15[].
