Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 4

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be counted by looking at each node individually. 

- For Node 0: No 3-stars as it is only connected to nodes 4 and 6.
- For Node 1: No 3-stars as it is only connected to nodes 2, 6, and 7.
- For Node 2: One 3-star with Node 2 as the center and nodes 1, 4, and 6 as the leaves. 
- For Node 3: No 3-stars as it is only connected to Node 2.
- For Node 4: One 3-star with Node 4 as the center and nodes 0, 2, and 6 as the leaves.
- For Node 5: No 3-stars as it is only connected to nodes 2 and 4.
- For Node 6: Two 3-stars with Node 6 as the center and leaves {0, 1, 4} and {8, 2, 4}.
- For Node 7: No 3-stars as it is only connected to Node 1.
- For Node 8: No 3-stars as it is only connected to nodes 5 and 6.
- For Node 9: No 3-stars as it is only connected to nodes 2 and 4.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4]. 

The unique 3-stars found are <2, (1, 4, 6)>, <4, (0, 2, 6)>, <6, (0, 1, 4)>, and <6, (8, 2, 4)>.
