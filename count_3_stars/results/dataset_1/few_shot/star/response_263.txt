Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 2

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we should identify all the occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern. Let's go through each node:

1. Node 0: <0, (3, 4, 5)>
2. Node 1: <1, (4, 5, 9)>
3. Node 2: - (Not connected to exactly three other nodes)
4. Node 3: <3, (0, 4, 8)>
5. Node 4: <4, (0, 1, 3)>
6. Node 5: <5, (0, 1, 8)>
7. Node 6: - (Not connected to exactly three other nodes)
8. Node 7: - (Not connected to exactly three other nodes)
9. Node 8: <8, (0, 3, 5)>
10. Node 9: - (Not connected to exactly three other nodes)

Therefore, there are a total of [4] 3-stars in the given graph. 
The unique 3-stars are <0, (3, 4, 5)>, <1, (4, 5, 9)>, <3, (0, 4, 8)>, and <5, (0, 1, 8)>.
