Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 6
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 8

Response:
There are three 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<3, (1, 5, 6)>
<6, (2, 3, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
