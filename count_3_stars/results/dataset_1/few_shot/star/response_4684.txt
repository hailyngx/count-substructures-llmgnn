Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node and check if it is the center of a 3-star. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars step-by-step:

1. Node 0:
   - (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7)
   - <0, (2, 4, 7)>

2. Node 1:
   - (1, 3) (1, 9)
   - <1, (3, 9)>

3. Node 2:
   - (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8)
   - <2, (0, 3, 4)>

4. Node 3:
   - (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8)
   - <3, (1, 2, 8)>

5. Node 4:
   - (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8)
   - <4, (0, 2, 6)>

6. Node 5:
   - (5, 6) (5, 8)

7. Node 6:
   - (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9)
   - <6, (4, 5, 9)>

8. Node 7:
   - (7, 0)

9. Node 8:
   - (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5)
   
10. Node 9:
   - (9, 1) (9, 6)

Hence, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
  
<0, (2, 4, 7)>, <1, (3, 9)>, <2, (0, 3, 4)>, <3, (1, 2, 8)>, <4, (0, 2, 6)>, <6, (4, 5, 9)>
