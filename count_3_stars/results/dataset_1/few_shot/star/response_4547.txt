Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 3
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 7

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are as follows:
<0, (3, 5, 9)>
<2, (5, 8, 3)>
<3, (0, 4, 5)>
<7, (8, 9, 0)>
<8, (2, 4, 3)>
