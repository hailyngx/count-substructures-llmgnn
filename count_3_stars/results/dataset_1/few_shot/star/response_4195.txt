Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible 3-stars where the central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step by step:

1. Start by looking for nodes that have exactly three neighbors. These nodes are potential central nodes for 3-stars.

Nodes 1, 4, and 8 have exactly three neighbors each: Node 1 (connected to nodes 3, 4, 5), Node 4 (connected to nodes 1, 3, 7), and Node 8 (connected to nodes 1, 3).

2. For each of these potential central nodes, check if they form a 3-star.

- For Node 1: (1, 3, 4), (1, 3, 5), and (1, 4, 5) form 3-stars.
- For Node 4: (4, 1, 3), (4, 3, 7) also form 3-stars.
- For Node 8: (8, 1, 3) forms a 3-star.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in the given graph are:
<1, (3, 4, 5)>, <4, (1, 3, 7)>, and <8, (1, 3)>.

Count of 3-stars: [3]
