Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 5
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 7

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 6, and 8.
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 7, and 8.
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 4, and 5.
  
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
The unique 3-star configurations are <0, (4, 6, 8)>, <5, (1, 7, 8)>, and <8, (3, 4, 5)>.
