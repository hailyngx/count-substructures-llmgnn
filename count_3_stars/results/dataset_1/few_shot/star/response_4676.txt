Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 8
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in the form of a 3-star.

Looking at the adjacency list and the given edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:

<0, (4, 6, 2)>
<1, (2, 3, 6)>
<3, (1, 6, 7)>
<6, (0, 2, 9)>
<8, (3, 4, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
