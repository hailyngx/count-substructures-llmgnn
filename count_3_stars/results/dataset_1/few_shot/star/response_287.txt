Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 4

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star configuration.

Let's determine the 3-stars step by step:
1. Count all the 3-stars involving node 0:
   - Node 0 is connected to nodes 6 and 9.
   - So, the 3-star configurations involving node 0 are:
     - <0, (6, 9)>

2. Count all the 3-stars involving node 1:
   - Node 1 is connected to nodes 5, 7, and 8.
   - So, the 3-star configurations involving node 1 are:
     - <1, (5, 7, 8)>
     
3. Count all the 3-stars involving node 5:
   - Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 6.
   - So, the 3-star configurations involving node 5 are:
     - <5, (1, 4, 6)>
     - Note: <5, (4, 6, 1)> is the same as the previous one and will not be counted again.
     
4. Count all the 3-stars involving node 6:
   - Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 5, 7, and 8.
   - So, the 3-star configurations involving node 6 are:
     - <6, (0, 5, 7)>
     - <6, (0, 7, 8)>
     - <6, (5, 7, 8)>
   - Note: The configuration <6, (7, 8, 0)> is the same as <6, (0, 7, 8)> and will not be counted again.

5. Add up all the unique 3-star configurations found:
   - <0, (6, 9)>, <1, (5, 7, 8)>, <5, (1, 4, 6)>, <6, (0, 5, 7)>, and <6, (5, 7, 8)>
   
Final answer: [5]
