Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all unique configurations where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a 3-star pattern.

Let's list down all the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<1, (0, 2, 7)>
<2, (0, 1, 6)>
<3, (4, 5, N/A)>
<4, (0, 3, 5)>
<5, (3, 4, 8)>
<6, (0, 2, 7)>
<7, (1, 6, 8)>
<8, (5, 6, 7)>

Count of 3-stars: [10]
