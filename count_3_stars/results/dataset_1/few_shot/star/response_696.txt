Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 5) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 4

Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 5, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the 3-star structures present in the graph. 

A 3-star is formed by a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. We will check each node in the graph to see if it forms a 3-star. 

Let's analyze the possible 3-star configurations: 

1. For node 0: <0, (1, 4, _)>  (Node 0 is connected to nodes 1 and 4, forming a 3-star).

2. For node 1: <1, (0, 6, _)>  (Node 1 is connected to nodes 0 and 6, forming a 3-star).

3. For node 3: <3, (4, 7, _)>  (Node 3 is connected to nodes 4 and 7, forming a 3-star).

4. For node 5: <5, (4, 6, 7)>  (Node 5 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 7, forming a 3-star).

5. For node 6: <6, (1, 5, 9)>  (Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 9, forming a 3-star).

6. For node 9: <9, (5, 6, _)>  (Node 9 is connected to nodes 5 and 6, forming a 3-star).

Therefore, the 3-stars found in the given graph are: 
<0, (1, 4, _)> 
<1, (0, 6, _)> 
<3, (4, 7, _)> 
<5, (4, 6, 7)> 
<6, (1, 5, 9)> 
<9, (5, 6, _)> 

As there are 6 unique 3-stars identified, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
