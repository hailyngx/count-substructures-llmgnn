Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we look for each node that has exactly three neighbors, and then check if these neighbors are connected to each other.

Here are the 3-stars in the given graph:
[3]

Unique 3-stars:
<3, (5, 7, 8)>
