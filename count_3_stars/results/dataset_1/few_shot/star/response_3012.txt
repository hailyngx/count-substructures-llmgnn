Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 9) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a 3-star pattern. Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

1. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 2, and 4. <1, (0, 2, 4)>
2. Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 4, and 8. <2, (1, 4, 8)>
3. Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 2, and 5. <4, (1, 2, 5)>
4. Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 5, and 6. <9, (0, 5, 6)>

Therefore, there are a total of [4] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
