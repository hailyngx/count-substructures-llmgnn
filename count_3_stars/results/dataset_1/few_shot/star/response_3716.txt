Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star structure.

By analyzing the given adjacency list, we can determine the following 3-stars in the graph:
1. <0, (7, 8, 9)>
2. <2, (4, 8, 9)>
3. <5, (6, 7, 8)>
4. <8, (0, 4, 5)>
5. <9, (0, 4, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
