Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star pattern, which consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the adjacency list provided, we can easily identify the 3-stars:
1. Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 5, and 6. <0, (2, 5, 6)>
2. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 3, and 6. <1, (2, 3, 6)>
3. Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 6, and 7. <3, (1, 6, 7)>
4. Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 4, and 6. <5, (0, 4, 6)>
5. Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, and 3. <6, (0, 1, 3)>
6. Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 4, and 8. <7, (3, 4, 8)>

Therefore, there are [6] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
