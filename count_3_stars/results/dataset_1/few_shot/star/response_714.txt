Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 5

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph.

From the adjacency list, we can see that the possible 3-star graphs can have central nodes with 3 leaves connected to them. Let's identify all such 3-star graphs:

1. Node 2 <2, (3, 5, 8)>
2. Node 4 <4, (0, 1, 6)>
3. Node 5 <5, (1, 2, 9)>
4. Node 6 <6, (0, 1, 3)>
5. Node 8 <8, (2, 7, -)> [One leaf node is missing]
6. Node 9 <9, (4, 5, -)> [One leaf node is missing]

Hence, the total number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [5].
