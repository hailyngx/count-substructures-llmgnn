Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node and its three connected nodes in each 3-star pattern. 

Using the provided information, we can identify the 3-star structures in the graph:

1. <0, (8, 9, 5)>
2. <1, (2, 3, 8)>
3. <3, (1, 6, 8)>
4. <5, (4, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
  
The unique 3-stars are: <0, (8, 9, 5)>, <1, (2, 3, 8)>, <3, (1, 6, 8)>, <5, (4, 8, 9)>.
