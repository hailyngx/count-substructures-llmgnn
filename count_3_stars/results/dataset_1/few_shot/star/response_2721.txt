Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 7

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 5, and 7: <0, (3, 5, 7)>
2. Node 1 does not form a 3-star as it has only 2 neighbors.
3. Node 2 does not form a 3-star as it has only 2 neighbors.
4. Node 3 does not form a 3-star as it has only 2 neighbors.
5. Node 4 does not form a 3-star as it has more than 3 neighbors.
6. Node 5 does not form a 3-star as it has more than 3 neighbors.
7. Node 6 does not form a 3-star as it has more than 3 neighbors.
8. Node 7 does not form a 3-star as it has only 2 neighbors.
9. Node 8 does not form a 3-star as it has only 1 neighbor.
10. Node 9 does not form a 3-star as it has only 2 neighbors.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1]. 
The unique 3-star found in the graph is <0, (3, 5, 7)>.
