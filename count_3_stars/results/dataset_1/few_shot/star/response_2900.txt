Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 3

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be counted by examining each node which could potentially be a central node of a 3-star. 

Let's start by listing the 3-stars in the graph:

<1, (3, 7, 9)>
<3, (1, 8, 9)>
<6, (4, 5, 7)>
