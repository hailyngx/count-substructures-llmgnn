Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through each node and find the 3-stars:

For Node 0: (0, 1, 6, 8), (0, 1, 6, 9)
For Node 1: (1, 0, 3, 6), (1, 0, 6, 8)
For Node 6: (6, 0, 1, 5), (6, 0, 1, 7), (6, 0, 1, 8), (6, 0, 1, 9)

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the graph are:
<0, (1, 6, 8)>, <0, (1, 6, 9)>, <1, (0, 3, 6)>, <1, (0, 6, 8)>, <6, (0, 1, 5)>, <6, (0, 1, 7)>, <6, (0, 1, 8)>, <6, (0, 1, 9)>

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
