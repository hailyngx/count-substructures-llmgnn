Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 7

Response:
First, we see that the center node of a 3-star must be connected to exactly three other nodes. 
Let's identify the nodes that satisfy this condition:
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 6, and 7.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 7, and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, 5, and 9.

Next, we need to check if these nodes and their connections form 3-stars.
Let's check for each potential 3-star:
1. For node 2:
    - <2, (1, 4, 6)> is not a 3-star as 1, 4, and 6 are not directly connected.
    - <2, (1, 4, 7)> is not a 3-star as 1 is not directly connected to 7.
    - <2, (1, 6, 7)> is not a 3-star as 1 is not directly connected to 6.
    - <2, (4, 6, 7)> is a valid 3-star.

2. For node 4:
    - <4, (2, 3, 7)> is a valid 3-star.
    - <4, (2, 7, 9)> is not a 3-star as 2 is not directly connected to 9.

3. For node 7:
    - <7, (2, 3, 4)> is a valid 3-star.
    - <7, (2, 4, 5)> is not a 3-star as 4 is not directly connected to 5.
    - <7, (2, 4, 9)> is not a 3-star as 4 is not directly connected to 9.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
The unique 3-stars found are: <2, (4, 6, 7)>, <4, (2, 3, 7)>, and <7, (2, 3, 4)>.
