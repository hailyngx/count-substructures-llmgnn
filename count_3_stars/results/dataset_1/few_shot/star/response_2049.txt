Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each set of nodes that form a 3-star. A 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the adjacency list provided, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (1, 4, 9)>
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<2, (1, 5, 6)>
<4, (0, 7, 8)>
<5, (2, 8)>
<6, (2, 3, 7)>
<7, (2, 4, 6)>
<8, (4, 5, 7)>
<9, (0, 1, 6)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars: [9]
