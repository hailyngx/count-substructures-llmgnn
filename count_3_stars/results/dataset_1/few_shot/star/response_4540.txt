Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes (i.e., forms a 3-star). Let's go through the adjacency list for each node:

- Node 0: Forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 4, and 6 <0, (3, 4, 6)>
- Node 1: Does not form a 3-star
- Node 2: Does not form a 3-star
- Node 3: Forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, and 9 <3, (0, 1, 9)>
- Node 4: Does not form a 3-star
- Node 5: Does not form a 3-star
- Node 6: Does not form a 3-star
- Node 7: Does not form a 3-star
- Node 8: Does not form a 3-star
- Node 9: Forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 3, and 6 <9, (0, 3, 6)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (3, 4, 6)> and <3, (0, 1, 9)>.
