Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will be the centers of the 3-stars.

Given the adjacency list, the 3-star configurations in the graph are as follows:
<0, (2, 6, 9)>
<1, (3, 5, 9)>
<3, (1, 6, 7)>
<5, (1, 4, 8)>
<9, (0, 1, 7)>

Counting the unique 3-stars found above, we get a total of [5].
