Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 4

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we can identify the 3-stars:
<0, (3, 5, 9)>
<1, (2, 4, 7)>
<3, (0, 1, 9)>
<5, (0, 1, 6)>
<6, (1, 5, 7)>
<9, (0, 3, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [6].
