Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 6, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star-like pattern.

Based on the adjacency list provided, we can identify the 3-stars as follows:

<0, (3, 8, 9)>
<3, (0, 4, 8)>
<4, (3, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 3, 4)>
<9, (0, 4, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
