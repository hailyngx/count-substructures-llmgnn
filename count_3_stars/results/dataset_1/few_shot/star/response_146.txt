Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 4) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 0

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

The possible 3-stars can be formed with each node as the center and the nodes it is connected to as the leaves. 

Now, we can list out the unique 3-stars:
<0, (6, 9)>
<1, (2, 4)>
<2, (1, 4, 6)>
<4, (1, 2, 6)>
<6, (0, 2, 4)>
<7, (2, 4)>

Counting the number of 3-stars gives us a total of [6].
