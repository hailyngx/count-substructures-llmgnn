Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (4, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we should identify all unique occurrences where a node is the center of a 3-star. 

Looking at the adjacency list and edges provided, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (2, 7, 9)>
<1, (4, 8)>
<2, (0, 5, 7)>
<2, (0, 6, 9)>
<2, (5, 6, 7)>
<6, (2, 9, 0)>
<7, (0, 2, 5)>
<7, (2, 5, 0)>
  
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
