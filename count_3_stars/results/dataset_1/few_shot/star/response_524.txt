Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all unique instances of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's denote the nodes based on their connections to other nodes and then identify the 3-stars present:

- Node 0: (4, 6, 8)
- Node 1: (2, 3, 5)
- Node 2: (1, 4)
- Node 3: (1, 4, 5, 8)
- Node 4: (0, 2, 3, 5)
- Node 5: (1, 3, 4, 8)
- Node 6: (0, 7, 8)
- Node 7: (6, 8)
- Node 8: (0, 3, 5, 6, 7)

Now, let's find the unique 3-stars:
<0, (4, 6, 8)>
<1, (2, 3, 5)>
<3, (1, 4, 5)>
<4, (0, 2, 5)>
<6, (0, 7, 8)>
<8, (0, 5, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
