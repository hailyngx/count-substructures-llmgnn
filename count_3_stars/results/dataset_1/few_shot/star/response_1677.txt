Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 
Let's list the 3-stars we can find in this graph:

<0, (1, 8, 9)>
<1, (0, 5, 8)>
<2, (3, 4, 5)>
<4, (2, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 1, 4)>
<9, (0, 4, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
