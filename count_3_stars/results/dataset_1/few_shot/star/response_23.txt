Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star. 

Looking at the provided adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars: 
<0, (1, 9, 6)>
<1, (0, 6, 2)>
<2, (3, 4, 6)>
<3, (2, 7, 5)>
<4, (2, 5, 8)>
<5, (2, 4, 7)>
<6, (1, 2, 7)>
<7, (3, 5, 9)>
<8, (4, 6, 3)>
<9, (0, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
