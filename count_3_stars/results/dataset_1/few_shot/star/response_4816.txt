Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that can act as the center of a 3-star. A 3-star is formed by selecting a central node and its three adjacent nodes. We then check if these three adjacent nodes are interconnected with each other.

Here are the 3-star configurations present in the graph:

<1, (3, 4, 8)>
<1, (4, 5, 8)>
<3, (1, 4, 9)>
<4, (0, 1, 2)>
<4, (1, 3, 6)>
<4, (1, 6, 8)>
<4, (2, 6, 5)>
<5, (1, 6, 8)>
<6, (0, 2, 4)>
<6, (1, 4, 9)>

There are a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
