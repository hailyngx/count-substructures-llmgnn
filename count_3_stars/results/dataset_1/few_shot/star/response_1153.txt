Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Analyzing the given graph's nodes and their connections, we can identify the following 3-stars:

<0, (1, 6, 8)>
<0, (1, 8, 9)>
<1, (0, 2, 5)>
<1, (2, 3, 5)>
<2, (1, 3, 5)>
<2, (3, 4, 9)>
<4, (2, 7, 9)>
<4, (7, 8, 9)>
<6, (0, 7, 8)>
<8, (0, 4, 9)>

Therefore, there are a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
