Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we should look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (3, 4, 7)>
<3, (0, 2, 9)>
<3, (6, 8, 9)>
<9, (5, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
