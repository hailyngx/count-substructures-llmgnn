Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the 3-stars present in the graph. 

Let's list the 3-stars found in the graph:
<1, (3, 5, 6)>
<1, (5, 6, 9)>
<3, (1, 8, 5)>
<5, (1, 6, 9)>
<5, (6, 1, 9)>
<7, (4, 5, 9)>

Counting the unique 3-stars listed above, we find that there are [6] such 3-stars in the graph.
