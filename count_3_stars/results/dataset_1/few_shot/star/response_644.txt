Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first determine the 3-stars by identifying the central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's identify the 3-stars by looking for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:

- Node 0: (0, 4, 5, 7) - Not a 3-star since it is connected to 4 nodes.
- Node 1: (1, 6) - Not a 3-star since it is only connected to 1 node.
- Node 2: (2, 3, 7) - This is a 3-star <2, (3, 5, 7)>.
- Node 3: (2, 3, 5) - This is a 3-star <3, (2, 5, 7)>.
- Node 4: (0, 4, 8) - Not a 3-star since it is connected to 3 nodes.
- Node 5: (0, 3, 5, 7, 9) - Not a 3-star since it is connected to 5 nodes.
- Node 6: (1, 6) - Not a 3-star since it is only connected to 1 node.
- Node 7: (0, 2, 5, 7, 8, 9) - Not a 3-star since it is connected to 6 nodes.
- Node 8: (4, 7) - Not a 3-star since it is connected to 2 nodes.
- Node 9: (5, 7) - Not a 3-star since it is connected to 2 nodes.

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are <2, (3, 5, 7)> and <3, (2, 5, 7)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
