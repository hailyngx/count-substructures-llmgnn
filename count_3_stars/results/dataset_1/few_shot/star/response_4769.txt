Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

From the given adjacency list, we can tell that nodes 1, 2, and 5 are the only nodes connected to exactly three other nodes each. 

Let's identify the 3-stars involving these nodes:
1. Node 1: <1, (2, 4, 6)>
2. Node 2: <2, (1, 3, 7)>
3. Node 5: <5, (2, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
