Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 6

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star-like pattern.

From the adjacency list and edge information provided, we can see that the possible 3-stars in the graph are as follows:
- <0, (1, 2, 6)>
- <1, (0, 3, 9)>
- <4, (3, 6, 8)>
- <5, (3, 8, 9)>
- <6, (0, 4, 7)>
- <7, (0, 3, 6)>
- <8, (3, 4, 5)>
- <9, (1, 4, 5)>

Counting these unique 3-stars, we find that there are [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
