Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 8)

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will be the centers of the 3-stars. We then need to identify the three nodes connected to each center, which will form the leaves of the 3-stars.

Let's start by examining each node and identifying any 3-stars around them:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 8, and 9. Node 0 forms a 3-star with (3, 8, 9).

- Node 1 is connected to node 6. Node 1 doesn't form a 3-star.

- Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 6, and 9. Node 2 forms a 3-star with (4, 5, 9).

- Node 3 is connected to node 0. Node 3 doesn't form a 3-star.

- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2 and 7. Node 4 doesn't form a 3-star.

- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 7. Node 5 forms a 3-star with (0, 2, 7).

- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1 and 2. Node 6 doesn't form a 3-star.

- Node 7 is connected to nodes 4 and 5. Node 7 doesn't form a 3-star.

- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0 and 9. Node 8 doesn't form a 3-star.

- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 8. Node 9 forms a 3-star with (0, 2, 8).

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (3, 8, 9)>
<2, (4, 5, 9)>
<5, (0, 2, 7)>
<9, (0, 2, 8)>

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is therefore [4].
