Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 8

Response:
To determine the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible configurations where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's analyze the graph:
1. Node 0 is connected to 1, 3, 4, and 7
2. Node 1 is connected to 0, 3, 4, 7, and 9
3. Node 2 is connected to 6 and 7
4. Node 3 is connected to 0, 1, and 9
5. Node 4 is connected to 0 and 1
6. Node 5 is connected to 6 and 8
7. Node 6 is connected to 2, 5, and 9
8. Node 7 is connected to 0, 1, 2, and 8
9. Node 8 is connected to 5, 7, and 9
10. Node 9 is connected to 1, 3, 6, and 8

Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:  
[5]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1].

Unique 3-stars:
<5, (6, 8, 9)>
