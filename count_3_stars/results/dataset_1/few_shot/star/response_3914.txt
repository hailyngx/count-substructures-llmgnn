Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a star. 

Looking at the adjacency list for each node provided, we can identify the following 3-stars:

<0, (1, 4, 8)>
<1, (0, 4, 9)>
<3, (1, 8, 9)>
<4, (0, 1, 2)>
<4, (0, 1, 7)>
<7, (0, 1, 5)>
<9, (1, 3, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
