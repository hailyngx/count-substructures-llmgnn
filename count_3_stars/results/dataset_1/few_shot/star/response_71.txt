Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, following the definition of a 3-star.

Here are the unique 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<0, (2, 5, 9)>
<2, (0, 4, 5)>
<2, (0, 5, 9)>
<3, (1, 5, 8)>
<4, (0, 2, 5)>
<5, (0, 2, 4)>
<5, (0, 2, 9)>
<5, (3, 4, 9)>
<9, (0, 2, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
