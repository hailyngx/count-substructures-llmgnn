Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 6

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node has exactly 3 neighbors, which form a 3-star with that node as the center. Let's find these 3-stars step-by-step:

1. Nodes with exactly 3 neighbors:
   - Node 0 has 3 neighbors (4, 5, 9)
   - Node 2 has 3 neighbors (1, 6, 8)
   - Node 8 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form a 3-star.
   - Node 9 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form a 3-star.

2. Unique 3-stars found:
   - <0, (4, 5, 9)>
   - <2, (1, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
Inside brackets, the final answer is [2].
