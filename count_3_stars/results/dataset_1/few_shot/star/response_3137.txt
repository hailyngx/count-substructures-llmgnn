Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, 7, 8, and node 9

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star in the graph. A 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Given the adjacency list and the edges provided, we can find the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 5, 7: <0, (4, 5, 7)>
2. Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 8, 9: <0, (4, 8, 9)>
3. Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 7, 8: <0, (5, 7, 8)>
4. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 9, 6: <1, (4, 9, 6)>
5. Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 8, 7: <3, (5, 8, 7)>
6. Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 8, 0: <4, (2, 8, 0)>
7. Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 8, 7: <4, (2, 8, 7)>
8. Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 8, 0: <4, (1, 8, 0)>
9. Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 8, 7: <4, (1, 8, 7)>
10. Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 5, 8: <7, (0, 5, 8)>
11. Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 5, 7: <8, (0, 5, 7)>
12. Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 4, 1: <9, (0, 4, 1)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is: [12].
