Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 2

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for each node that is directly connected to exactly three other nodes. Since a 3-star has a center node connected to exactly three leaf nodes, we can identify the 3-stars by inspecting each node in the graph.

From the given adjacency list, we can identify the 3-stars as follows:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 2, and 4: <0, (1, 2, 4)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 7, and 8: <1, (0, 7, 8)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 7, and 9: <2, (0, 7, 9)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, and 5: <7, (0, 1, 5)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
