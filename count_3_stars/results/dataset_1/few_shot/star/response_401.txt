Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 7

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:
    - Node 0: <0, (3, 8, 9)>
    - Node 7: <7, (4, 9, 0)>

Therefore, there are [2] 3-stars in this graph.
