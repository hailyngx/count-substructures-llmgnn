Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's start by finding all the 3-stars:

1. Considering node 1 as the central node:
    - Nodes connected to node 1: 3, 6, 7, 8, 9
    - Possible 3-stars: 
        <1, (3, 6, 7)>
        <1, (3, 7, 9)>
    
2. Considering node 7 as the central node:
    - Nodes connected to node 7: 1, 6, 9
    - Possible 3-star: 
        <7, (1, 6, 9)>
    
3. Considering node 9 as the central node:
    - Nodes connected to node 9: 1, 4, 7
    - Possible 3-star: 
        <9, (1, 4, 7)>
    
4. Considering node 3 as the central node:
    - Nodes connected to node 3: 1, 2
    - No 3-star is formed with node 3 as the central node since it is connected to only two other nodes.

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3]. 
The unique 3-stars are <1, (3, 6, 7)>, <1, (3, 7, 9)>, and <7, (1, 6, 9)>.
