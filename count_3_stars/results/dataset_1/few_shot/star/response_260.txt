Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that can be the center of a 3-star and count how many 3-stars are formed around that center.

Let's go through each node and identify the 3-stars:

1. Node 0: Not a center of any 3-star.
2. Node 1: Not a center of any 3-star.
3. Node 2: Not a center of any 3-star.
4. Node 3: Forms 2 3-stars:
   <3, (4, 6, 8)>
   <3, (4, 6, 9)>
5. Node 4: Forms 3 3-stars:
   <4, (0, 7, 9)>
   <4, (2, 3, 7)>
   <4, (3, 7, 9)>
6. Node 5: Not a center of any 3-star.
7. Node 6: Forms 1 3-star:
   <6, (2, 3, 7)>
8. Node 7: Not a center of any 3-star.
9. Node 8: Forms 2 3-stars:
   <8, (1, 7, 9)>
   <8, (3, 7, 9)>
10. Node 9: Not a center of any 3-star.

Overall, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].  
The unique 3-stars are <3, (4, 6, 8)>, <3, (4, 6, 9)>, <4, (0, 7, 9)>, <4, (2, 3, 7)>, <4, (3, 7, 9)>, and <8, (1, 7, 9)>.
