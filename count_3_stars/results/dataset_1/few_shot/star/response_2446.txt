Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5, and node 7

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are:
[<3, (2, 7, 8)>, <5, (4, 7, 9)>, <7, (3, 5, 9)>]

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
