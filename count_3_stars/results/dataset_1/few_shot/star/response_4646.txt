Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 8
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are:
<1, (6, 8, 9)>
<3, (2, 6, 7)>
<3, (6, 7, 8)>
<7, (3, 6, 8)>
