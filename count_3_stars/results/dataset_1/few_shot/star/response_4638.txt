Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern.

Based on the adjacency list provided, here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<1, (0, 3, 6)>
<5, (4, 6, 9)>
<6, (1, 2, 8)>
<6, (1, 5, 9)>

Count of 3-stars in the graph: [4]
