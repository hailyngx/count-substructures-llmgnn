Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 5
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Here are the steps to find the 3-stars in the graph:
1. Identify nodes with three neighbors since these nodes can be the centers of the 3-stars.
2. For each identified node, check if it is indeed the center of a 3-star by verifying that the three neighbors are connected to each other.

Let's go through each node to find the 3-stars:

1. Node 0: Not a center of a 3-star since it has only 2 neighbors.
2. Node 1: Not a center of a 3-star since it has only 2 neighbors.
3. Node 2: Not a center of a 3-star since it has more than 3 neighbors.
4. Node 3: Not a center of a 3-star since it has only 2 neighbors.
5. Node 4: Potential center of a 3-star: (4, 1, 8, 9) -> <4, (1, 8, 9)>
6. Node 5: Potential center of a 3-star: (5, 0, 6, 8) -> <5, (0, 6, 8)>
7. Node 6: Not a center of a 3-star since it has more than 3 neighbors.
8. Node 7: Not connected to any other nodes.
9. Node 8: Not a center of a 3-star since it has more than 3 neighbors.
10. Node 9: Not a center of a 3-star since it has more than 3 neighbors.
