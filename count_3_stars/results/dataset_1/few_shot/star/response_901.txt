Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 9
