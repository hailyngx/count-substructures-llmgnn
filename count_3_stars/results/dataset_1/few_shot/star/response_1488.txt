Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes (forming a 3-star).

Upon examining the graph, we can determine the following 3-stars:
<0, (5, 7, 2)>
<1, (7, 8, 4)>
<2, (5, 6, 0)>
<3, (4, 5, 7)>
<4, (3, 5, 8)>
<5, (0, 2, 3)>
<6, (2)>
<7, (0, 1, 3)>
<8, (1, 4, 9)>
<9, (8)>

Considering all unique 3-stars found, we have a total of [9] 3-stars in the graph.
