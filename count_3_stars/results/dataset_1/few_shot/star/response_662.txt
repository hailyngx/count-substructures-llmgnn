Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a 3-star shape. 

After examining the graph and adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (3, 8, 9)>
<3, (0, 4, 6)>
<4, (3, 6, 9)>
<5, (2, 6, 9)>
<6, (4, 5, 7)>
<7, (1, 6, 8)>
<8, (0, 7, 9)>
<9, (0, 5, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
