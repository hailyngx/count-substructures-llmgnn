Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (9, 2) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 4
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 4

Response:
First, we need to identify the 3-stars in the graph. We observe that a 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list the 3-stars found in the given graph:

<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<2, (7, 9, -)>
<3, (0, 7, -)>
<4, (0, 7, 9)>

Next, we count the total number of 3-stars in the graph.
