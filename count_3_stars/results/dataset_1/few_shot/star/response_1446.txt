Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node in the graph is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star pattern.

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (2, 3, 6)>
<0, (2, 6, 7)>
<0, (3, 5, 7)>
<2, (0, 6, 9)>
<3, (0, 5, 7)>
<4, (5, 7, 9)>
<5, (1, 3, 5)>
<5, (4, 6, 5)>
<5, (6, 8, 5)>
<5, (5, 8, 9)>
<7, (0, 3, 7)>
<8, (5, 8, 9)>
<9, (2, 5, 9)>
<9, (4, 7, 9)>
<9, (5, 7, 9)>

Count: [15]
