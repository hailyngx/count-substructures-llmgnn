Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 7

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star pattern. 

In a 3-star graph, the center node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's look for such configurations in the given graph:

1. Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 7. This forms a 3-star with node 1 as the center and nodes 2, 5, 7 as leaves. <1, (2, 5, 7)>

2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 7, and 9. This forms a 3-star with node 1 as the center and nodes 2, 7, 9 as leaves. <1, (2, 7, 9)>

3. Node 1 is connected to nodes 5, 7, and 9. This forms a 3-star with node 1 as the center and nodes 5, 7, 9 as leaves. <1, (5, 7, 9)>

[The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 3.]
