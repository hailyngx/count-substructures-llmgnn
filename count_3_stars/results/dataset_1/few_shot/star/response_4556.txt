Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 2

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph and list them uniquely, we will identify each 3-star pattern in the graph. 

Starting with the provided adjacency list and the definition of a 3-star graph, we will look for nodes that have exactly 3 neighbors connected to them to form a 3-star structure.

Let's list all the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<0, (2, 4, 7)>
<2, (0, 3, 4)>
<2, (0, 4, 5)>
<2, (3, 4, 9)>
<2, (4, 5, 9)>
<4, (0, 2, 7)>
<4, (2, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
