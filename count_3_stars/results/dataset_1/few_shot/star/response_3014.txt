Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 1) (6, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 4
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the provided information, we see that there are two 3-stars in this graph.

[2]

Unique 3-stars:
<1, (0, 3, 5)>
<3, (1, 2, 8)>
