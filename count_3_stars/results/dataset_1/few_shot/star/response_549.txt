Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find the 3-stars by identifying the central node and its connected nodes for each star. 

Let's go through the adjacency list and find all the 3-stars:

1. For node 1:
   - (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 9) forms 3-star <1, (4, 5, 9)>

2. For node 3:
   - (3, 4), (3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 9) forms 3-star <3, (4, 6, 7)>

3. For node 4:
   - (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 7) forms 3-star <4, (1, 3, 5)>
   - (4, 1), (4, 5), (4, 7) forms 3-star <4, (1, 5, 7)> (This is the same star as above, but listed differently)

4. For node 5:
   - (5, 1), (5, 4), (5, 9) forms 3-star <5, (1, 4, 9)>

5. For node 6:
   - (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 9) forms 3-star <6, (2, 3, 9)>

6. For node 9:
   - (9, 1), (9, 3), (9, 5), (9, 6) forms 3-star <9, (1, 3, 5)>
   - (9, 1), (9, 5), (9, 6) forms 3-star <9, (1, 5, 6)> (This is the same star as above, but listed differently)

Hence, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].  
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <1, (4, 5, 9)>, <3, (4, 6, 7)>, <4, (1, 3, 5)>, <4, (1, 5, 7)>, <5, (1, 4, 9)>, <6, (2, 3, 9)>, <9, (1, 3, 5)>, <9, (1, 5, 6)>.
