Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 6

Response:
First, let's identify all the possible 3-star configurations in the graph. Each 3-star will have a central node and three leaves connected to the central node.

From the adjacency list, we can list out the possible 3-star configurations:

<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<0, (1, 7, 9)>
<0, (4, 5, 7)>
<1, (0, 6, 9)>
<2, (5, 6, 9)>
<3, (6, 7, -)>
<4, (0, 7, 8)>
<5, (0, 2, 6)>
<5, (0, 6, 8)>
<5, (2, 6, 8)>
<6, (1, 3, 9)>
<6, (3, 5, 9)>
<6, (5, 9, -)>
<7, (0, 3, -)>
<8, (4, 5, -)>
<9, (0, 2, 6)>

Now, we count the number of unique 3-stars: 
[16]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is: [16]
