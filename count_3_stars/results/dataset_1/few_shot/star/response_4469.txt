Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 1) (7, 0) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 8

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

Starting from each node, we can check if it is the center of a 3-star by looking at its neighbors. If a node has exactly three neighbors, then it is the center of a 3-star. 

Here are the 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<3, (0, 1, 4)>

So the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
