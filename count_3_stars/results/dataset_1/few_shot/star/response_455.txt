Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes (forming a 3-star pattern).

Looking at the given graph:
- Node 0 is connected to 7 other nodes (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7)
- Node 1 is connected to 2 other nodes (0, 5)
- Node 2 is connected to 3 other nodes (0, 4, 9)
- Node 3 is connected to 3 other nodes (0, 6, 9)
- Node 4 is connected to 4 other nodes (0, 2, 5, 8)
- Node 5 is connected to 3 other nodes (0, 1, 4)
- Node 6 is connected to 3 other nodes (0, 3, 7)
- Node 7 is connected to 2 other nodes (0, 6)
- Node 8 is connected to 2 other nodes (4, 9)
- Node 9 is connected to 3 other nodes (2, 3, 8)

From the above information, the possible 3-stars in the graph are:
1. <0, (1, 2, 3)>
2. <0, (4, 5, 6)>
3. <0, (4, 5, 8)>
4. <3, (0, 6, 9)>
5. <4, (0, 2, 5)>
6. <4, (0, 5, 8)>
7. <9, (2, 3, 8)>

[The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 7.]
