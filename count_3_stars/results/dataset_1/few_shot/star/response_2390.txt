Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all possible combinations of one central node and three leaves connected to it. 

Based on the provided adjacency list and edges, we can identify the 3-stars:
- <0, (2, 4, 5)>
- <1, (4, 6, 8)>
- <2, (0, 7, 9)>
- <3, (1, 7, 8)>
- <4, (0, 1, 7)>
- <6, (1, 7, 8)>
- <8, (1, 5, 6)>
- <9, (2, 6, 0)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
