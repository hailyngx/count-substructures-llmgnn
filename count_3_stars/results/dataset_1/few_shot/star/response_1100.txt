Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming 3-stars. 

Considering the adjacency list of each node, we can identify the following 3-stars in the graph:

[3]
<2, (1, 3, 5)>
<2, (1, 3, 6)>
<2, (3, 5, 6)>
<4, (0, 3, 7)>
<4, (3, 7, 8)>
<6, (2, 3, 7)>
<6, (2, 3, 9)>
<6, (2, 7, 9)>
<6, (3, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
