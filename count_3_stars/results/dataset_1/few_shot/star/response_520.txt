Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the 3-stars present in the graph based on the definition provided. 

Let's list the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<1, (2, 3, 4)>
<1, (4, 9, _)>
<2, (0, 1, 4)>
<3, (0, 1, 4)>
<4, (0, 1, 2)>
<4, (0, 1, 3)>
<4, (0, 2, 3)>
<4, (1, 9, _)>
<5, (0, 4, _)>
<8, (4, 7, _)>
<9, (1, 4, _)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars: [14]
