Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Based on the adjacency list provided:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 3, and 6.
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 4, and 9.
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 4, and 6.
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 9, and 7.
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 7, and 9.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are:
<0, (2, 3, 6)>
<2, (0, 4, 9)>
<7, (1, 9, 7)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
