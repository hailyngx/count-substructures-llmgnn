Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a 3-star pattern.

Observing the adjacency list and the edges, we can find the following 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (2, 9)>
<1, (3, 9)>
<2, (0, 4)>
<3, (1, 7)>
<5, (7, 8, 9)>
<7, (3, 5, 8)>
<8, (5, 7, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 5)>
<9, (6, 8, 9)>

Count of 3-stars: [9]
