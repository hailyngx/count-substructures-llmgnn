Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 4, 7, and node 8

Response:
Following are the 3-stars in the given graph:
[3]

Here is the visual representation of the graph:  

        0 - 9
        |
    1 - 2 - 8
    |   | X |
    4 - 7 - 9
        |
        6

Explanation:
- Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes, so it cannot be a part of any 3-star.
- Every other node that is connected to exactly 3 other nodes does not form a 3-star structure based on the given connections. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1.  
Thus, the answer is [1].
