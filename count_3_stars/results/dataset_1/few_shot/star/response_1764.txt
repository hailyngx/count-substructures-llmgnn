Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 6) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 6
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 7

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

Based on the given information, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (5, 9, 7)>
<5, (0, 7, 8)>
<6, (2, 4, 8)>
<7, (1, 4, 5)>
<9, (0, 6, 7)>

Count of 3-stars: [5]
