Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will look for each possible 3-star configuration with a center node and three leaf nodes.

Here are the unique 3-stars in the given graph:
<1, (3, 5, 7)>
<2, (4, 5, 7)>
<4, (2, 7, 9)>
<6, (8, 9, 9)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
