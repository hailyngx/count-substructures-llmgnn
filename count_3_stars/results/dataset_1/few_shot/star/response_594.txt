Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 8) (6, 0) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 8

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

<0, (3, 6)>
<1, (2, 7, 9)>
<2, (1, 9, 4)>
<4, (8, 9, 5)>
