Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 5

Response:
Given the information provided, the total number of 3-stars (each consisting of a central node and three leaves) in the graph can be calculated as follows:

- Node 0 forms 3-stars with nodes 3, 4, 5, and 6: <0, (3, 4, 5)>, <0, (3, 4, 6)>, <0, (3, 5, 6)>, <0, (4, 5, 6)> (Total: 4)
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 2, and 8: <4, (0, 2, 8)> (Total: 1)
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 6, and 9: <5, (0, 6, 9)> (Total: 1)
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 5, and 7: <6, (0, 5, 7)> (Total: 1)

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [7].
