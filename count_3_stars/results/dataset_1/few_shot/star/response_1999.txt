Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, 7, and node 8

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph:

- Node 0: (0, 5, 7), (0, 7, 8) [<0, (5, 7, 8)>]
- Node 1: No 3-star as it has only one edge.
- Node 2: No 3-star as it has edges with two other nodes only.
- Node 3: No 3-star as it has edges with two other nodes only.
- Node 4: (4, 7, 9) [<4, (7, 9)>]
- Node 5: No 3-star as it has only one edge.
- Node 6: No 3-star as it has edges with two other nodes only.
- Node 7: (7, 0, 2), (7, 0, 3), (7, 0, 4), (7, 0, 9), (7, 2, 3), (7, 3, 4), (7, 4, 9), (7, 9, 8) [<7, (0, 2, 3)>, <7, (0, 4, 9)>]
- Node 8: No 3-star as it has edges with two other nodes only.
- Node 9: (9, 1, 4), (9, 1, 6), (9, 1, 8), (9, 4, 7), (9, 4, 6), (9, 4, 8), (9, 6, 8), (9, 7, 0), (9, 7, 4), (9, 7, 8) [<9, (1, 4, 6)>, <9, (4, 7, 8)>]

Count of 3-stars: [5]
