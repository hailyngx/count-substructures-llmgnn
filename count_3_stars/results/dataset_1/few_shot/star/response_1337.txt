Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 5

Response:
Based on the given graph, we can count the number of 3-stars by identifying the central nodes and their connected leaves. 

1. For Node 0:
    - Node 0 is connected to nodes 4 and 5.
    <0, (4, 5)>

2. For Node 2:
    - Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 8, and 9.
    <2, (4, 8, 9)>

3. For Node 4:
    - Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 5, and 7.
    <4, (0, 2, 5)>
   
4. For Node 5:
    - Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 6, 8, and 9.
    <5, (0, 4, 9)>
    <5, (0, 4, 8)>
    <5, (4, 6, 9)>
    <5, (4, 6, 8)>
   
Therefore, there are a total of [7] 3-stars in the given graph.
