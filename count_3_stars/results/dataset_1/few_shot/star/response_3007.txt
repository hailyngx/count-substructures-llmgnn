Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 6
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 3

Response:
The given graph can be represented as:
```
0 --- 3
|     | \
|     |  6
|     | /
3 --- 4 --- 8
|  /  | \
| /   |  5
|/    |
7     9
```

Let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph.
