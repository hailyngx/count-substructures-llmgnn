Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

After examining the graph's structure, we can identify the 3-stars as follows:
- <0, (2, 3, 7)>
- <0, (3, 1, 7)>
- <0, (7, 1, 4)>
- <0, (9, 4, 1)>
- <4, (1, 2, 6)>
- <4, (2, 0, 6)>
- <4, (6, 7, 7)>
- <4, (7, 7, 1)>
- <5, (7, 7, 8)>
- <5, (8, 7, 7)>
- <9, (4, 0, 2)> 

Count of 3-stars in the given graph is [11].
