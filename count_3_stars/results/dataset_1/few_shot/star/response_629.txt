Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 8

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for instances where a node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes, forming a star pattern. Let's identify and count the 3-stars in the graph.

The 3-star patterns in the given graph are as follows:
<0, (5, 6, 9)>
<1, (3, 4, 5)>
<1, (3, 5, 6)>
<1, (4, 5, 6)>
<1, (7, 8, 9)>
<2, (3, 5, 6)>
<2, (4, 5, 8)>
<2, (5, 1, 6)>
<3, (1, 2, 6)>
<4, (1, 3, 8)>
<8, (9, 1, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].  
<[0, (5, 6, 9)]>  
<[1, (3, 4, 5)]>  
<[1, (3, 5, 6)]>   
<[1, (4, 5, 6)]>  
<[1, (7, 8, 9)]>  
<[2, (3, 5, 6)]>  
<[2, (4, 5, 8)]>  
<[2, (5, 1, 6)]>  
<[3, (1, 2, 6)]>  
<[4, (1, 3, 8)]>  
<[8, (9, 1, 2)]>
