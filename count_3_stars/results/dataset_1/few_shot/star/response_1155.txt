Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars in the graph. 

Looking at the definition of a 3-star graph (a central node connected to exactly three other nodes), we examine each node's connections to see if they form a 3-star. 

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (2, 6, 8)>
<2, (0, 5, 7)>
<4, (5, 6, 9)>
<5, (2, 3, 4)>
<6, (0, 3, 4)>
<8, (0, 6, 9)>

By counting the unique 3-stars found, we get a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
