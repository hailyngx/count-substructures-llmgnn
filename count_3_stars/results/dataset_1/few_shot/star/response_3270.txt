Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star configuration. 

Starting from the adjacency list, we see that nodes 4 and 0 do not participate in any 3-star configurations. So, we only need to consider the remaining nodes for potential 3-star configurations.

Looking at the remaining nodes (1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9), we find the following 3-star configurations:

<1, (0, 5, 9)>
<2, (5, 7, 9)>
<5, (1, 2, 6)>
<6, (0, 3, 7)>
<7, (0, 2, 9)>
<8, (0, 3, 0)>
<9, (1, 2, 7)>

Now, we count the total number of unique 3-stars found, which is [7].
