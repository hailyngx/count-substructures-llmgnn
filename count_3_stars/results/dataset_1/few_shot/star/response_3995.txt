Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify 3-stars in the graph. 

A 3-star is formed by a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the graph:

- Node 0 can form a 3-star with nodes 2, 5, 7 as leaves: <0, (2, 5, 7)>
- Node 2 can form a 3-star with nodes 0, 3, 8 as leaves: <2, (0, 3, 8)>
- Node 3 can form a 3-star with nodes 2, 4, (5 or 6) as leaves: <3, (2, 4, 5)> or <3, (2, 4, 6)>
- Node 7 can form a 3-star with nodes 0, 9, (2 or 3) as leaves: <7, (0, 9, 2)> or <7, (0, 9, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
