Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star in the graph. Since a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can look for nodes that have exactly three neighbors.

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the given graph:

<0, (4, 7, 8)>
<1, (2, 3, 6)>
<2, (1, 7, 8)>
<3, (1, 4, 9)>
<4, (0, 3, 5)>
<5, (4, 9)>
<6, (1, 8, 9)>
<7, (0, 2)>
<8, (0, 1, 6)>
<9, (3, 4, 5)>

Count of 3-stars in the given graph: [10]
