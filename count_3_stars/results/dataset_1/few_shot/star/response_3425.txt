Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Upon examining the graph information provided, we can identify the following 3-stars:
- <0, (1, 6, 6)>
- <1, (0, 3, 6)>
- <1, (3, 3, 6)>
- <1, (6, 0, 2)>
- <1, (6, 2, 6)>
- <1, (6, 3, 8)>
- <1, (6, 8, 2)>
- <1, (6, 8, 3)>
- <6, (0, 1, 2)>
- <6, (1, 0, 3)>
- <6, (1, 2, 8)>
- <6, (1, 3, 8)>
- <8, (2, 3, 5)>
- <8, (3, 1, 6)>
- <8, (3, 5, 9)>
- <8, (5, 3, 9)>

Counting all of these unique 3-stars, we find that there are a total of [16] 3-stars in the given graph.
