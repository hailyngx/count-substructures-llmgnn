Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 6

Response:
Based on the given information, the graph can be visualized as follows:

```
0 --- 3
.     .
.     \
9 --- 2 --- 1 --- 7 --- 8
       |     |     |     |
       \     |     |     |
        6 --- 4 --- 7     |
              |     |     |
              5     6     |
                            9
```

Let's now count the number of 3-stars in this graph. 

To do this, we need to identify all instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

After examining the graph, we find that there are 2 unique 3-stars in this graph. 

Therefore, the final answer is: [2].

Unique 3-stars:
<1, (2, 6, 7)>
<6, (1, 4, 7)>
