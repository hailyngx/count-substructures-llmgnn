Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all possible 3-stars. 

In a 3-star, the central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list down the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<0, (1, 2, 7)>
<0, (1, 2, 8)>
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<4, (0, 9, 6)>
<9, (1, 4, 8)>
<9, (1, 4, 6)>
<9, (1, 4, 7)>
<9, (1, 7, 8)>

Count of 3-stars in the given graph: [10]
