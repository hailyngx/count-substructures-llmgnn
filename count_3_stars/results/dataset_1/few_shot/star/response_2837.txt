Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 7

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:
<[1, (0, 7, 9)]>, <[1, (4, 7, 9)]>, <[1, (7, 4, 8)]>, <[1, (7, 9, 4)]>
Count of 3-stars: [4]
