Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Below are the 3-stars found in the graph:

[<0, (8, 9)>]
[<1, (4, 5, 8)>, <1, (4, 7, 8)>]
[<2, (6, 8)>]
[<3, (6, 7)>]
[<4, (1, 7, 8)>]
[<6, (2, 3, 8)>, <6, (7, 8, 9)>]
[<8, (0, 2, 9)>, <8, (1, 4, 6)>, <8, (6, 9, 0)>]
[<9, (0, 6, 8)>]

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [12].
