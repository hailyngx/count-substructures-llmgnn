Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 7

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the graph. We look for nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them.

Central nodes: 1, 6, and 7

Next, we examine each central node and its neighboring nodes to identify the 3-stars. 

For central node 1:
<1, (0, 6, 7)>
<1, (4, 6, 8)>
<1, (7, 2, 9)>

For central node 6:
<6, (1, 7, 8)>

For central node 7:
<7, (1, 2, 9)>

Count of 3-stars: [7].
