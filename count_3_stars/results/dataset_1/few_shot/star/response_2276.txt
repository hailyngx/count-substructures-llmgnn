Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the possible 3-stars by looking at each node and its neighbors.

Here are the 3-stars found in the given graph:
[10]

<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<1, (2, 3, 4)>
<3, (1, 2, 4)>
<4, (0, 1, 3)>
<5, (0, 3, 7)>
<6, (0, 2, 8)>
<7, (1, 5, 9)>
<9, (4, 5, 7)>
