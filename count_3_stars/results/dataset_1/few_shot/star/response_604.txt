Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star in the graph where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

The three other nodes connected to the central node in a 3-star are called leaves. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (5, 8, 2)>
<1, (5, 7, 5)>
<2, (5, 6, 8)>
<4, (5, 5, 0)>
<5, (0, 1, 9)>
<6, (2, 7, 8)>
<7, (1, 5, 6)>
<8, (0, 2, 6)>
<9, (5, 6, 5)>

Count of 3-stars: [9]
