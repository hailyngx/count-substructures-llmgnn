Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 5
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 1

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Since a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we will look for such patterns.

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 1: <1, (2, 3, 9)>
- Node 2: <2, (1, 4, 6)>
- Node 4: <4, (2, 3, 8)>
- Node 8: <8, (2, 4, 5)>

Count of 3-stars: [4]

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
