Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we first identify all the 3-star configurations.

The 3-stars in the given graph are:
<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<1, (4, 5, -)>
<2, (4, 5, 7)>
<3, (0, 4, 7)>
<3, (4, 8, 9)>
<4, (1, 2, 3)>
<4, (2, 6, -)>
<4, (6, 8, 9)>
<5, (0, 1, 2)>
<5, (1, 8, -)>
<5, (2, 8, -)>
<6, (0, 4, -)>
<6, (4, 8, -)>
<8, (3, 5, 6)>
<9, (3, 4, -)>

Count of 3-stars: [14]
