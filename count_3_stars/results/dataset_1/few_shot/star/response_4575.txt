Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will be the centers of the 3-stars. Let's identify them first:

1. Node 3 is connected to nodes 6 and 8.
2. Node 5 is connected to nodes 4, 7, and 9.
3. Node 8 is connected to nodes 3, 7, and 9.
4. Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 5, 6, 7, and 8.

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
<3, (6, 8, 9)>
<5, (4, 7, 9)>
<8, (3, 7, 9)>
<9, (0, 5, 6)>
<9, (5, 6, 7)>
<9, (6, 7, 8)>

Counting the unique 3-stars gives us a total count of [6].
