Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 7

Response:
The 3-star graph can be identified by finding nodes that are connected to exactly 3 other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph by examining each node:

Nodes connected to exactly 3 other nodes:
- Node 0: <0, (6, 7, 9)>
- Node 1: Not a 3-star
- Node 2: Not a 3-star
- Node 3: Not a 3-star
- Node 4: Not connected to any other nodes
- Node 5: Not connected to any other nodes
- Node 6: <6, (0, 7, 9)>
- Node 7: <7, (0, 1, 9)> and <7, (0, 2, 8)> and <7, (1, 6, 8)> and <7, (2, 6, 8)>
- Node 8: Not a 3-star
- Node 9: <9, (0, 7, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4]. 
The unique 3-stars are <0, (6, 7, 9)>, <6, (0, 7, 9)>, <7, (0, 1, 9)>, and <9, (0, 7, 6)>.
