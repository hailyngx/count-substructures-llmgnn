Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible 3-star configurations by considering each node as the center and checking its connections to three other nodes.

Let's go through each node to find the 3-star configurations:

1. For node 0: Not a center of any 3-star.
2. For node 1: <1, (2, 3, 8)>
3. For node 2: Not a center of any 3-star.
4. For node 3: <3, (0, 1, 5)>
5. For node 4: Not a center of any 3-star.
6. For node 5: Not a center of any 3-star.
7. For node 6: Not a center of any 3-star.
8. For node 7: <7, (2, 4, 5)>
9. For node 8: Not a center of any 3-star.
10. For node 9: Not connected to any other nodes, not a center of any.

Count of 3-stars: [2]
Unique 3-stars: <1, (2, 3, 8)>, <3, (0, 1, 5)>
