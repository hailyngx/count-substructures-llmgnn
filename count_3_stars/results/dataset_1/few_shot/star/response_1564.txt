Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to look for nodes that have exactly three neighbors and form a 3-star pattern. In a 3-star, one node (the central node) is connected to three other nodes (the leaves).

From the given adjacency list, we can determine the nodes that have exactly three neighbors:
- Node 2: connected to nodes 0, 7, and 9
- Node 3: connected to nodes 0, 5, and 9

Therefore, there are two 3-stars in this graph.
