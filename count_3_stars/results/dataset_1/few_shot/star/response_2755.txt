Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 8

Response:
First, let's find all the 3-stars in the given graph. 
A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the adjacency list:
- Node 0 is not the center of any 3-star as it is connected to only one node.
- Node 1 can form a 3-star with nodes 3, 4, and 8.
- Node 2 is not the center of any 3-star as it is connected to only two nodes.
- Node 3 can form 3-stars with nodes 1, 4, 8 and 5.
- Node 4 can also form 3-stars with nodes 1, 3, 8 and 5.
- Node 5 is not the center of any 3-star as it is connected to four nodes.
- Node 6 is not the center of any 3-star as it is connected to only two nodes.
- Node 7 is not the center of any 3-star as it is connected only to two nodes.
- Node 8 can form a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, 4 and 9.
- Node 9 is not the center of any 3-star as it is connected to only one node. 

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the graph are:
<1, (3, 4, 8)>
<3, (1, 4, 8)>
<4, (1, 3, 8)>
<8, (1, 3, 4)>

Count of 3-stars: [4]
