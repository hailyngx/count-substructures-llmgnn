Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (9, 1) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 6

Response:
Considering the definition of a 3-star graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

The nodes that meet this criteria are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, and 9. 

Let's list the 3-stars in this graph: 
<1, (3, 6, 7)>
<3, (1, 2, 4)>
<3, (1, 4, 7)>
<3, (2, 3, 5)>
<3, (3, 4, 5)>
<3, (3, 7, 1)>
<4, (2, 3, 5)>
<4, (3, 1, 2)>
<6, (1, 9, 7)>
<7, (1, 3, 9)>
<9, (1, 6, 7)>

Therefore, there are [11] 3-stars in the given graph.
