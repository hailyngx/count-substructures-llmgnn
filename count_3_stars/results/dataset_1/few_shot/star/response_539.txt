Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 0
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 3
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 6, and node 8

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- In the given graph, there are two 3-stars: <0, (1, 3, -)> and <3, (0, 4, 8)>. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
