Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 6

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

```
    1 -- 0 -- 4
    |         |
    2         8
              |
              6
              |
              9
              |
              3 -- 5 -- 7
```

Now let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph.

As per the definition, a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

For each node, we can check if there are any 3-stars centered at that node:
- Node 0: No
- Node 1: Yes, <1, (0, 2, 8)>
- Node 2: No
- Node 3: No
- Node 4: Yes, <4, (0, 8, 7)>
- Node 5: Yes, <5, (2, 3, 8)> and <5, (3, 7, 9)>
- Node 6: No
- Node 7: No
- Node 8: Yes, <8, (1, 4, 5)>
- Node 9: No

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (0, 2, 8)>
<4, (0, 8, 7)>
<5, (2, 3, 8)>
<5, (3, 7, 9)>
