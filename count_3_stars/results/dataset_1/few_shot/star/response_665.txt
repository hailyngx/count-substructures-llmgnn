Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, and node 9

Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we can look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will serve as the centers of the 3-stars. Then, we can identify the other nodes that are directly connected to the center node to form each 3-star.

Let's find the 3-stars in this graph step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 4:
    a. <0, (2, 3, 4)>

2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 8, and 9. However, node 1 is connected to four nodes, so it cannot be a center of a 3-star.

3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 7, and 8:
    a. <2, (0, 7, 8)>

4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0 and 9. As it is not connected to three nodes, it cannot be a center of a 3-star.

5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 7, 8, and 9. Node 4 is connected to four nodes, so it cannot be a center of a 3-star.

6. Nodes 5 and 6 are connected to only one node each, so they cannot be centers of a 3-star.

7. Node 7 is connected to nodes 2 and 4. As it is not connected to three nodes, it cannot be a center of a 3-star.

8. Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 4:
    a. <8, (1, 2, 4)>

9. Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 4:
    a. <9, (1, 3, 4)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3]. 
The unique 3-stars are <0, (2, 3, 4)>, <2, (0, 7, 8)>, and <8, (1, 2, 4)>.
