Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 6

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be found by counting the number of unique nodes that can serve as the center of a 3-star.

Let's analyze the given graph:

Node 0 has 1 connection: 2
Node 1 has 2 connections: 3, 9
Node 2 has 2 connections: 0, 4
Node 3 has 5 connections: 1, 5, 6, 8, 9
Node 4 has 3 connections: 2, 5, 7
Node 5 has 2 connections: 3, 4
Node 6 has 2 connections: 3, 9
Node 7 has 2 connections: 4, 8
Node 8 has 2 connections: 3, 7
Node 9 has 3 connections: 1, 3, 6

From the analysis above, the nodes that can serve as the center of a 3-star are: 1, 3, 4, and 9. Each of these nodes is connected to exactly 3 other nodes.

So, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

<1, (3, 5, 9)>
<3, (1, 6, 9)>
<4, (2, 5, 7)>
<9, (1, 3, 6)>
