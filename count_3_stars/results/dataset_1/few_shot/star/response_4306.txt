Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node of each potential 3-star and then check if it is connected to exactly three other nodes (leaves) in a star-like configuration. 

Let's start by listing all the possible 3-stars in the graph:

Possible 3-stars:
<0, (1, 2, 7)>
<1, (0, 2, 5)>
<2, (0, 1, 4)>
<2, (0, 1, 7)>
<2, (1, 4, 8)>
<3, (1, 6, 0)>
<4, (2, 9, 1)>
<5, (1, 7, 0)>
<6, (3, 7, 0)>
<7, (0, 2, 5)>
<7, (0, 2, 6)>
<8, (2, 1, 4)>
<9, (1, 4, 2)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars:
[11]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [11].
