Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 8) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all unique 3-stars in the graph. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<1, (0, 7, 9)>
<6, (0, 7, 9)>
<7, (0, 1, 5)>

Now, we count the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph:
