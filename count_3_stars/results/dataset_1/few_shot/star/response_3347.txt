Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 7

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star patterns in the graph:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors 0, 2, and 8. <1, (0, 2, 8)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with neighbors 1, 5, and 6. <2, (1, 5, 6)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with neighbors 0, 2, and 9. <7, (0, 2, 9)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with neighbors 4, 7, and 9. <3, (4, 7, 9)>

Count of 3-stars: [4]
