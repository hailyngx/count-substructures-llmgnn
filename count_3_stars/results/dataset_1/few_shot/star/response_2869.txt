Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for each node that has exactly 3 neighbors and check if it forms a 3-star. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we can identify the nodes that have exactly 3 neighbors:

1. Node 0
2. Node 4
3. Node 7

Let's check each of these nodes to see if they form 3-stars: 

1. For Node 0: (0, 1, 8)
2. For Node 4: (4, 2, 0)
3. For Node 7: (7, 9, 1)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3] and they are found as follows:
<0, (1, 8)>
<4, (2, 0)>
<7, (9, 1)>
