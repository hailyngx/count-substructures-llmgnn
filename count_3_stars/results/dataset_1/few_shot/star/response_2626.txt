Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's start by listing the 3-star configurations:

<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<0, (1, 2, 8)>
<0, (1, 2, 9)>
<0, (2, 8, 9)>
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<2, (0, 1, 7)>
<2, (0, 1, 9)>
<2, (1, 3, 7)>
<2, (1, 3, 9)>
<2, (3, 6, 7)>
<2, (8, 0, 9)>
<2, (8, 2, 9)>
<2, (9, 0, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [13].
