Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8)

Node 9 is connected to node 3, 6, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique occurrence of a 3-star.

Looking at the description of the graph, we can see that there is no direct way to find all the 3-stars. We need to consider all possible sets of 3 nodes connected to a central node. 

For each node, we can analyze its neighbors to identify 3-stars centered at that node. Let's enumerate the 3-stars:

1. Node 0: <0, (2, 3, 5)>, <0, (2, 5, 6)>, <0, (3, 5, 6)>
2. Node 1: <1, (4, 6, 7)>, <1, (6, 7, 8)>
3. Node 2: <2, (0, 3, 4)>, <2, (3, 4, 7)>
4. Node 3: <3, (0, 2, 7)>, <3, (2, 7, 9)>, <3, (6, 7, 9)>
5. Node 4: <4, (1, 2, 6)>
6. Node 5: <5, (0, 6, 8)>
7. Node 6: <6, (0, 1, 7)>, <6, (0, 7, 9)>, <6, (1, 7, 8)>
8. Node 7: <7, (1, 3, 6)>, <7, (1, 6, 8)>, <7, (3, 6, 9)>, <7, (6, 8, 9)>
9. Node 8: <8, (5, 6, 7)>, <8, (6, 7, 9)>
10. Node 9: <9, (3, 6, 7)>, <9, (6, 7, 8)>

Counting the unique 3-stars identified: 15

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].
