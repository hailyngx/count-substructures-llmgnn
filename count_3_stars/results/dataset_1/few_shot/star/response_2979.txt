Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can identify all the possible 3-stars by looking at nodes that are connected in the form of a star with the center node and its three connecting nodes.

Let's identify the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<3, (2, 5, 6)>
<3, (1, 5, 7)>
<3, (6, 7, 9)>
<6, (2, 7, 9)>
<6, (7, 8, 9)>

Now we count the number of unique 3-stars found:

[6]
