Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes since a 3-star consists of a center node connected to three other leaves.

Here are the 3-stars in the given graph:
[3]

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (4, 6, 7)>
<0, (4, 6, 9)>
<3, (5, 6, 7)>
