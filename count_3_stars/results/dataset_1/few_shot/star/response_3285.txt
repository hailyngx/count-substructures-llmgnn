Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 7
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we'll need to identify all possible 3-stars. A 3-star is formed when the center node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Now, let's list all unique 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<1, (0, 5, 6)>
<2, (0, 5, 7)>
<4, (0, 9, 6)>
<5, (1, 2, 7)>
<6, (1, 9, 4)>
<7, (2, 5, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
