Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
Step 1: Identify Nodes with 3 Adjacent Neighbors
From the adjacency list, we can see that nodes 1, 2, 3, and 5 have three adjacent neighbors each, making them potential centers of 3-stars.

Step 2: Count the 3-Stars for each Potential Center
1. Center at Node 1: 
    - (1, 2, 3)
    - (1, 2, 5)
    - (1, 3, 5)
    [Total: 3]

2. Center at Node 2:
    - (2, 1, 3)
    - (2, 1, 5)
    - (2, 3, 5)
    [Total: 3]

3. Center at Node 3:
    - (3, 1, 2)
    - (3, 1, 5)
    - (3, 2, 5)
    [Total: 3]

4. Center at Node 5:
    - (5, 1, 2)
    - (5, 1, 3)
    - (5, 2, 3)
    [Total: 3]

Step 3: Calculate the Total Number of 3-Stars
Adding up the 3-stars from each potential center:
3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 12

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].

Unique 3-Stars: 
<1, (2, 3, 5)>
<2, (1, 3, 5)>
<3, (1, 2, 5)>
<5, (1, 2, 3)>
