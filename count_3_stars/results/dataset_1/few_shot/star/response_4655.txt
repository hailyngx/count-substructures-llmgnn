Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0

Response:
First, let's find the 3-stars in the given graph.

Based on the edges and adjacency list provided, we can identify the following 3-stars:

1. <0, (3, 4, 5)>
2. <0, (3, 5, 8)>
3. <0, (3, 7, 9)>
4. <1, (3, 4, 6)>
5. <2, (3, 4, 7)>
6. <3, (0, 2, 7)>
7. <3, (0, 5, 7)>
8. <3, (1, 4, 6)>
9. <3, (4, 5, 7)>
10. <5, (0, 3, 7)>
11. <7, (2, 3, 5)>
  
Counting the unique 3-stars, we have a total of [11].
