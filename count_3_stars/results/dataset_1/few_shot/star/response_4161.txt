Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 5, and node 8

Response:
Given the graph, let's identify the 3-star structures:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 6, 7, and 9.
  - This gives us the 3-stars: 
    - <0, (1, 2, 9)>
    - <0, (6, 8, 9)>
  
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 8, and 9.
  - This gives us the 3-star: 
    - <2, (0, 8, 9)>

- Node 3 is connected to nodes 4 and 9.
  - This gives us the 3-star: 
    - <3, (4, 9, 5)>

- Node 5 is connected to nodes 8 and 9.
  - This gives us the 3-star: 
    - <5, (8, 9, 3)>

- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0 and 8.
  - This gives us the 3-star: 
    - <6, (0, 8, 9)>

- Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 6, and 9.
  - This gives us the 3-stars:
    - <8, (2, 0, 9)>
    - <8, (5, 9, 3)>
    - <8, (6, 0, 9)>

- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 5, and 8.
  - This gives us the 3-stars:
    - <9, (0, 2, 5)>
    - <9, (3, 4, 5)>
    - <9, (8, 6, 0)>

Counting all the unique 3-stars obtained, we find a total of [10] 3-stars.
