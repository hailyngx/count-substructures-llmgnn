Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (5, 3) (5, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 2

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph can be identified by looking for nodes with exactly three edges connected to them. Let's find all the 3-stars in the graph step by step:

1. Node 2 is a center of a 3-star. The 3-stars connected to node 2 are:
   <2, (3, 7, 8)>
   
2. Node 7 is a center of a 3-star. The 3-stars connected to node 7 are:
   <7, (2, 5, 8)>
   
3. Node 8 is a center of a 3-star. The 3-stars connected to node 8 are:
   <8, (2, 7, _)> There are not enough connections to form a 3-star with center 8.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
