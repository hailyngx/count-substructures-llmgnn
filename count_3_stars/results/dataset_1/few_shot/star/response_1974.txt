Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 4

Response:
Given the graph information, let's identify the 3-star subgraphs:

1. <0, (3, 4, 6)>
2. <2, (3, 5, 7)>
3. <3, (0, 2, 8)>
4. <4, (0, 5, 8)>
5. <5, (2, 4, 7)>
6. <7, (1, 5)>
7. <8, (3, 4)>
8. <9, (3, 4)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars found gives us the answer: [8].
