Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will look for nodes that have exactly three neighbors. Let's list the nodes that satisfy this condition along with their neighbors:

1. Node 3: (5, 7, 8)
2. Node 5: (3, 8, 9)

Now, let's form the 3-stars using the central nodes and their neighbors:

<3, (5, 7, 8)>
<5, (3, 8, 9)>

There are a total of [2] 3-stars in the given graph.
