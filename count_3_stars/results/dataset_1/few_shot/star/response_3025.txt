Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 6
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a 3-star pattern.

After examining the given information, we find the following 3-stars:
<1, (4, 5, 6)>
<3, (4, 5, 6)>
<4, (1, 3, 8)>
<5, (1, 3, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
