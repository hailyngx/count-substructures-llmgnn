Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 7
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we look for each possible central node and count the number of 3-stars connected to it.

Let's calculate:
- Node 0 has 3 connections: (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 8)
  - Therefore, there is 1 3-star centered at node 0: <0, (4, 5, 8)>
- Node 1 has 2 connections: (1, 4), (1, 5)
  - Therefore, there are no 3-stars centered at node 1.
- Node 2 has 1 connection: (2, 7)
  - Therefore, there are no 3-stars centered at node 2.
- Node 3 is isolated without any connections.
  - Therefore, there are no 3-stars centered at node 3.
- Node 4 has 4 connections: (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 6), (4, 7), (4, 8)
  - Therefore, there is 1 3-star centered at node 4: <4, (0, 1, 8)>
- Node 5 has 2 connections: (5, 0), (5, 1)
  - Therefore, there are no 3-stars centered at node 5.
- Node 6 has 3 connections: (6, 4), (6, 7), (6, 9)
  - Therefore, there is 1 3-star centered at node 6: <6, (4, 7, 9)>
- Node 7 has 4 connections: (7, 2), (7, 4), (7, 6), (7, 8)
  - Therefore, there is 1 3-star centered at node 7: <7, (2, 6, 8)>
- Node 8 has 3 connections: (8, 0), (8, 4), (8, 7)
  - Therefore, there is 1 3-star centered at node 8: <8, (0, 4, 7)>
- Node 9 has 1 connection: (9, 6)
  - Therefore, there are no 3-stars centered at node 9.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4]. 
The unique 3-stars are <0, (4, 5, 8)>, <4, (0, 1, 8)>, <6, (4, 7, 9)>, and <7, (2, 6, 8)>.
