Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Observing the graph and the adjacency list:
- Node 0 has one potential 3-star (0, 2, 6)
- Node 1 has one potential 3-star (1, 5, 8)
- Node 2 has one potential 3-star (2, 0, 6)
- Node 3 has no 3-star
- Node 4 has no 3-star
- Node 5 has one potential 3-star (5, 1, 4)
- Node 6 has one potential 3-star (6, 0, 2)
- Node 7 has no 3-star
- Node 8 has no 3-star
- Node 9 has no 3-star

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are: 
<0, (2, 6)> 
<1, (5, 8)>
<5, (1, 4)>
<6, (0, 2)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
