Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 6
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 1

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars that exist. A 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes. Below are the unique 3-stars found in the given graph:

<1, (2, 4, 9)>
<1, (5, 3, 9)>

Count of 3-stars: [2]
