Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern, which consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Observing the given adjacency list and the definition of a 3-star graph:
- A 3-star graph can only have one central node.
- A 3-star graph must have exactly three leaves connected to the central node.

Based on the given information, we can construct the following 3-star patterns:
<0, (3, 7, 8)>
<1, (2, 4, 9)>
<3, (0, 1, 6)>
<5, (6, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [4].
