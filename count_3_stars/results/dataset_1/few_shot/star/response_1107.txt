Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the 3-stars present. 

Let's start by finding all the 3-stars in the graph:

1. From the adjacency list, we see that the potential central nodes for 3-stars are: 0, 5, and 9.

2. For each potential central node, we check which node combinations satisfy the definition of a 3-star. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

   - For central node 0: 
     - Potential 3-stars: 
       - <0, (3, 4, 5)>
       - <0, (3, 5, 6)>
       - <0, (4, 5, 6)>
       - <0, (5, 6, 9)>
       - Total: 4

   - For central node 5: 
     - Potential 3-stars: 
       - <5, (0, 3, 4)>
       - <5, (0, 3, 6)>
       - <5, (0, 4, 6)>
       - <5, (3, 4, 6)>
       - <5, (3, 4, 8)>
       - <5, (4, 6, 8)>
       - Total: 6

   - For central node 9: 
     - Potential 3-stars: 
       - <9, (0, 6, 8)>
       - Total: 1

3. Summing up the total number of 3-stars from each central node:
   - Total 3-stars: [4 (from central node 0) + 6 (from central node 5) + 1 (from central node 9)] = 11

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [11].

Unique 3-stars: 
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<0, (5, 6, 9)>
<5, (0, 3, 4)>
<5, (0, 3, 6)>
<5, (0, 4, 6)>
<5, (3, 4, 6)>
<5, (3, 4, 8)>
<5, (4, 6, 8)>
<9, (0, 6, 8)>
