Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will be the central nodes of the 3-stars. Then, we will identify the three nodes that are connected to each central node to complete the 3-star.

Based on the provided information, let's find the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 1 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 3, 7, and 9.
2. Node 2 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 4, 5, and 9.
3. Node 3 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 1, 4, and 5.
4. Node 4 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 2, 3, and 9.
5. Node 5 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 2, 3, and 7.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].

<1, (3, 7, 9)>
<2, (4, 5, 9)>
<3, (1, 4, 5)>
<4, (2, 3, 9)>
<5, (2, 3, 7)>
