Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 7) (6, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 3

Response:
We first identify the 3-stars in the given graph. A 3-star graph has a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Here are the 3-stars in the given graph:
<0, (3, 1, 9)>
<1, (3, 0, 3)>
<2, (4, 6, 2)>
<3, (0, 1, 9)>
<4, (2, 6, 2)>
<5, (7, 7, 5)>
<6, (2, 4, 2)>
<7, (5, 7, 3)>
<9, (3, 0, 3)>

Counting the number of 3-stars in the graph, we find that there are [9] 3-stars.
