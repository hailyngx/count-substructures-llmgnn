Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 5
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
