Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's determine the 3-stars in this graph step-by-step:

1. Node 0:
   - <0, (1, 4, 6)>

2. Node 1:
   - No 3-star since it is connected to only two nodes.

3. Node 2:
   - <2, (3, 4, 5)>
   - <2, (4, 5, 6)>
   - <2, (5, 6, 7)>

4. Node 3:
   - No 3-star since it is connected to only one node.

5. Node 4:
   - <4, (0, 2, 8)>
   - <4, (2, 5, 6)>

6. Node 5:
   - No 3-star since it is connected to only two nodes.

7. Node 6:
   - <6, (0, 2, 7)>
   - <6, (2, 5, 7)>

8. Node 7:
   - <7, (2, 6, 8)>

9. Node 8:
   - No 3-star since it is connected to only two nodes.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
