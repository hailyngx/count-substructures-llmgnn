Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find each unique 3-star pattern which consists of a central node and three leaves connected to it. 

Based on the given graph information, we can identify the following 3-stars:

<0, (4, 6, 9)>
<2, (1, 6, 7)>
<2, (6, 7, 8)>
<4, (0, 6, 7)>
<4, (6, 7, 8)>
<7, (2, 3, 9)>
<7, (3, 4, 6)>
<8, (2, 3, 5)>
<8, (3, 4, 5)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars gives us a total of [9].
