Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 3

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph by finding nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list all the possible 3-stars:

<0, (2, 5, 3)>
<1, (4, 8, 3)>
<3, (5, 7, 8)>
<4, (1, 6, 8)>

Now we count the total number of unique 3-stars: [4].
