Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, creating a 3-star structure with the selected node as the center.

Let's analyze the graph step by step to find all 3-stars:

1. Node 0: (0, 1, 3), (0, 1, 5) [2 unique 3-stars]
2. Node 1: (1, 0, 6), (1, 0, 7), (1, 0, 8) [3 unique 3-stars]
3. Node 2: No 3-star as it's not connected to exactly 3 other nodes.
4. Node 3: (3, 0, 5), (3, 0, 7), (3, 0, 8) [3 unique 3-stars]
5. Node 4: No 3-star as it's not connected to exactly 3 other nodes.
6. Node 5: (5, 0, 2), (5, 0, 3), (5, 0, 7), (5, 0, 8), (5, 2, 3), (5, 2, 7), (5, 2, 8), (5, 3, 7), (5, 3, 8), (5, 7, 8) [10 unique 3-stars]
7. Node 6: No 3-star as it's not connected to exactly 3 other nodes.
8. Node 7: (7, 3, 4), (7, 3, 5), (7, 3, 9), (7, 4, 5), (7, 4, 9), (7, 5, 9) [6 unique 3-stars]
9. Node 8: (8, 1, 2), (8, 1, 3), (8, 1, 5), (8, 2, 3), (8, 2, 5), (8, 3, 5) [6 unique 3-stars]
10. Node 9: No 3-star as it's not connected to exactly 3 other nodes.

Considering all unique 3-stars identified, the final answer is **[2 + 3 + 3 + 10 + 6 + 6] = [30]**. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is **[30]**.
