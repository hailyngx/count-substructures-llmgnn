Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 4, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 5, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step by step:

1. Nodes with exactly three neighbors:
   - Node 0 has 4 neighbors (3, 6, 7, 8)
   - Node 1 has 2 neighbors (4, 7)
   - Node 2 has 2 neighbors (5, 6)
   - Node 3 has 2 neighbors (0, 6)
   - Node 4 has 3 neighbors (1, 5, 6)
   - Node 5 has 5 neighbors (2, 4, 7, 8, 9)
   - Node 6 has 5 neighbors (0, 2, 3, 4, 7)
   - Node 7 has 5 neighbors (0, 1, 5, 6, 9)
   - Node 8 has 2 neighbors (0, 5)
   - Node 9 has 2 neighbors (5, 7)

2. Based on the adjacency list, we can see that the nodes with exactly three neighbors are nodes 4, 5, 6, and 7. These nodes can potentially form 3-stars.

3. Counting the number of 3-stars:
   - Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 5, and 6: <4, (1, 5, 6)>
   - Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 2, and 4: <6, (0, 2, 4)>
   - Node 7 forms two 3-stars: 
     - <7, (0, 5, 9)>
     - <7, (1, 5, 6)>

In total, there are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.
