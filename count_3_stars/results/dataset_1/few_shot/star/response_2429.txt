Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 9) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 5, and node 8

Response:
We need to identify 3-star configurations in this graph. 
Let's list all the 3-stars in this graph to count them:

<0, (2, 7, 9)>
<1, (3, 9, 0)>
<2, (0, 9, 7)>
<3, (1, 9, 0)>
<5, (6, 9, 0)>
<6, (5, 9, 0)>
<7, (0, 8, 9)>
<8, (7, 9, 0)>
<9, (0, 1, 3)>
<9, (0, 3, 1)>
<9, (0, 5, 8)>
<9, (0, 8, 5)>
<9, (1, 3, 0)>
<9, (3, 1, 0)>
<9, (5, 6, 0)>
<9, (6, 5, 0)>
<9, (8, 7, 0)>
<9, (8, 0, 7)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we find that there are [18] 3-stars in the given graph.
