Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 7

Response:
Let's first identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph.

We have the following 3-star graphs:
<0, (3, 5, 7)>
<0, (3, 5, 8)>
<2, (6, 5, 8)>
<2, (6, 8, 9)>
<3, (0, 5, 8)>
<3, (5, 6, 8)>
<3, (5, 7, 8)>
<6, (1, 5, 8)>
<6, (2, 5, 8)>
<6, (5, 7, 8)>
<6, (5, 8, 9)>
<7, (3, 5, 8)>
<8, (3, 5, 6)>
<8, (3, 5, 6)>
<8, (6, 5, 7)>
<9, (2, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [16].
