Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 6, and node 8

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
1. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 2, and 3. <1, (0, 2, 3)>
2. Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, and 6. <2, (0, 1, 6)>
3. Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 2, and 9. <6, (1, 2, 9)>
4. Node 6 forms another 3-star with nodes 3, 7, and 9. <6, (3, 7, 9)>
5. Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 6, and 9. <8, (2, 6, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: 
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<2, (0, 1, 6)>
<6, (1, 2, 9)>
<6, (3, 7, 9)>
<8, (2, 6, 9)>
