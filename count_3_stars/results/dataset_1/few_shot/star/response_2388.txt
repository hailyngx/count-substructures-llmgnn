Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 9
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a 3-star pattern. 

After reviewing the provided information, we can list the unique 3-stars as follows:
<0, (1, 3, 9)>
<1, (0, 2, 4)>
<1, (2, 4, 7)>
<9, (0, 4, 7)>
<9, (4, 5, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
