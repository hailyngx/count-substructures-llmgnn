Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 8

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph step by step:

Step 1: For each node, identify the nodes it is connected to. 
- Node 0 is connected to: 2, 3, and 8
- Node 1 is connected to: 2, 5, 6, 7, and 9
- Node 2 is connected to: 0, 1, 5, and 9
- Node 3 is connected to: 0, 4, 6, and 9
- Node 4 is connected to: 3, and 5
- Node 5 is connected to: 1, 2, and 4
- Node 6 is connected to: 1, and 3
- Node 7 is connected to: 1
- Node 8 is connected to: 0, and 9
- Node 9 is connected to: 1, 2, 3, and 8

Step 2: Identify the 3-stars:
- The 3-star structures can be found around central nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 9. 
- Let's list the unique 3-stars:

<0, (2, 3, 8)>
<1, (2, 5, 9)>
<2, (0, 1, 9)>
<3, (0, 4, 9)>
<9, (1, 2, 8)>
