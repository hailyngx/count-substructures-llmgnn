Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 4, and node 5

Response:
Let's find the 3-star structures in the given graph:

From the adjacency list, we see that nodes 2, 5, and 8 each have 3 edges, making them eligible to be centers of 3-star structures. 

Now, let's analyze each potential center node:

1. Center node 2:
   - <2, (0, 1, 8)>
   - <2, (1, 3, 9)>
   
2. Center node 5:
   - <5, (0, 1, 8)>
   - <5, (1, 9, 7)>
   
3. Center node 8:
   - <8, (0, 1, 5)>
   - <8, (1, 4, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
