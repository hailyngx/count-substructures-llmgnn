Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 7

Response:
Given graph has a total of [10] nodes and [30] edges.
To count the number of 3-stars, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through the nodes and identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0: Not a center of any 3-star.
- Node 1: Not a center of any 3-star.
- Node 2: Not a center of any 3-star.
- Node 3: <3, (4, 6, 9)>
- Node 4: Not a center of any 3-star.
- Node 5: <5, (0, 2, 8)>
- Node 6: Not a center of any 3-star.
- Node 7: <7, (3, 5, 9)>
- Node 8: Not a center of any 3-star.
- Node 9: Not a center of any 3-star.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
Unique 3-stars found: 
<3, (4, 6, 9)>
<5, (0, 2, 8)>
