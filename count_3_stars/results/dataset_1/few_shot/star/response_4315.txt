Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 6

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are as follows:
<[0, (4, 6, 9)]> <br> 
<[2, (5, 3, 9)]> <br> 
<[6, (0, 3, 9)]> 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
