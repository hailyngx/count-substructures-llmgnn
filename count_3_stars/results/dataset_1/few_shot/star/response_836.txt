Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 7
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 6

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first identify the 3-stars by looking at nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Then we count the unique 3-stars present.

Given the adjacency list and edges provided, we can identify the 3-star structures in the graph:
1. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 5, and 8: <1, (3, 5, 8)>
2. Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 2, and 7: <3, (1, 2, 7)>
3. Node 5 forms two 3-stars: 
   - <5, (0, 1, 6)>
   - <5, (7, 8, 6)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we get a total of [3]. 

Therefore, the final answer is [3].
