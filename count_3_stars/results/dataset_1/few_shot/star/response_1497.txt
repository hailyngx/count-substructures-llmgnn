Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 7
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 8

Response:
Since a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can identify them by looking for nodes with exactly three neighbors in the graph. Let's identify those nodes first. 

Nodes with exactly three neighbors:
- Node 2: Connected to nodes 4, 8, and 9
- Node 8: Connected to nodes 1, 2, and 9
- Node 9: Connected to nodes 2 and 8

Now, let's form the 3-stars based on these central nodes and their connections:

<2, (4, 8, 9)>
<8, (1, 2, 9)>
<9, (2, 8, -)>

Count of 3-stars: [3]
