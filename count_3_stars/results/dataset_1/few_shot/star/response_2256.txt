Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 2) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 3

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges, forming a star shape with the node as the center.

Based on the provided information, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (2, 3, 6)>
<1, (2, 4, 7)>
<2, (0, 1, 6)>
<2, (0, 6, 8)>
<3, (0, 9, 6)>

Since each unique 3-star is listed only once, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
