Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars present. 

Let's start by listing down the 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (2, 3, 5)>
<1, (2, 3, 7)>
<1, (2, 3, 8)>
<2, (0, 1, 5)>
<2, (1, 5, 7)>
<2, (1, 5, 8)>
<3, (0, 1, 5)>
<3, (1, 5, 7)>
<3, (1, 5, 8)>
<5, (0, 2, 3)>
<5, (2, 3, 6)>
<5, (2, 3, 7)>
<5, (2, 3, 8)>
<6, (2, 3, 5)>
<7, (1, 2, 5)>
<7, (2, 5, 8)>
<8, (1, 3, 5)>
<8, (3, 5, 7)>
