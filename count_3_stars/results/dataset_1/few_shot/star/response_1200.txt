Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 8

Response:
The graph has the following 3-stars:

<0, (4, 8, 1)>
<0, (4, 8, 2)>
<0, (4, 8, 5)>
<0, (4, 8, 9)>
<2, (6, 8, 0)>
<2, (6, 8, 9)>
<2, (9, 8, 0)>
<2, (9, 8, 7)>
<2, (9, 8, 5)>
<9, (2, 8, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
