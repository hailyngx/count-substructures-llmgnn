Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 7

Response:
Given the information provided, we have the following 3-star subgraphs in the graph:

<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<4, (3, 6, 8)>
<6, (0, 4, 8)>
<7, (0, 3, 9)>
<8, (0, 4, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
