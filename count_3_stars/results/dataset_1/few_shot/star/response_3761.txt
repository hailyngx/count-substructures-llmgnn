Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify all the 3-stars in this graph:

<0, (5, 3, 6)>
<1, (6, 5, 9)>
<2, (7, 9, 3)>
<3, (5, 8, 9)>
<5, (0, 3, 6)>
<6, (1, 5, 9)>
<9, (2, 3, 6)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars found: [7].
