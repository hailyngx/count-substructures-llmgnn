Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify each 3-star configuration. 

Let's go step by step:

1. Node 0 forms a 3-star with leaves 2, 5: <0, (2, 5)>
2. Node 2 forms a 3-star with leaves 0, 1, 7: <2, (0, 1, 7)>
3. Node 4 forms a 3-star with leaves 3, 5, 6: <4, (3, 5, 6)>
4. Node 7 forms a 3-star with leaves 2, 3, 8: <7, (2, 3, 8)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars identified above.
