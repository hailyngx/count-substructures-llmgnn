Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 5
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 7

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node based on the given information:
Node 0: [3, 4, 5]
Node 1: []
Node 2: [3, 5, 7, 8]
Node 3: [0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9]
Node 4: [0, 3, 6]
Node 5: [0, 2]
Node 6: [3, 4, 7]
Node 7: [2, 6, 8, 9]
Node 8: [2, 3, 7]
Node 9: [3, 7]

Next, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:
1. <0, (3, 4, 5)>
2. <2, (3, 5, 7)>
3. <2, (3, 7, 8)>
4. <3, (0, 2, 4)>
5. <3, (0, 2, 8)>
6. <3, (4, 6, 9)>
7. <7, (2, 6, 8)>
8. <7, (3, 6, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [8].
