Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern in the graph. 

Let's list the 3-star patterns in the graph: 

<0, (2, 7, 0)>
<0, (2, 0, 7)>
<2, (0, 6, 2)>
<2, (0, 2, 6)>
<2, (6, 2, 9)>
<3, (7, 0, 3)>
<3, (7, 3, 0)>
<4, (1, 3, 4)>
<4, (1, 4, 3)>
<4, (3, 4, 1)>
<4, (3, 4, 5)>
<5, (4, 8, 5)>
<5, (4, 5, 8)>
<6, (2, 7, 6)>
<7, (0, 3, 7)>
<7, (0, 7, 3)>
<7, (3, 4, 7)>
<7, (3, 7, 0)>
<7, (3, 7, 6)>
<7, (6, 7, 2)>
<7, (7, 0, 3)>
<7, (7, 3, 4)>
<7, (7, 6, 2)>
<8, (4, 5, 8)>
<8, (4, 8, 5)>
<8, (7, 4, 8)>
<9, (2, 6, 9)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars in the given graph, we find that there are [26] 3-stars.
