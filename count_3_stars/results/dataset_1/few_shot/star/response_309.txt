Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 6) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 7

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each possible 3-star configuration where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Based on the given information, we can derive the following 3-stars:

<3, (4, 5, 8)>
<4, (2, 3, 5)>
<4, (2, 5, 8)>
<4, (3, 5, 8)>
<4, (6, 7, 9)>
<5, (3, 4, 8)>
<5, (3, 8, 9)>
<5, (4, 8, 9)>
<6, (1, 4, 9)>
<7, (0, 4, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
