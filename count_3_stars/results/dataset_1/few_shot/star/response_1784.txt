Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the unique 3-star structures in the graph. 

Observing the provided information, we can determine the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (3, 7, 8)>
<2, (6, 7, 8)>
<3, (0, 4, 5)>
<6, (2, 5, 7)>
<7, (0, 2, 6)>
<8, (0, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
