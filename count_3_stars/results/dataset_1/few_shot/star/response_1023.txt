Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 6

Response:
There are a total of 5 unique 3-stars in this graph. 

The 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<1, (0, 5, 8)>
<2, (0, 4, 9)>
<4, (0, 2, 9)>
<8, (1, 2, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
