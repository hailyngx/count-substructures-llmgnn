Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 3) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 6

Response:
The central node of a 3-star graph is the center, and it is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 
From the given graph and adjacency list, we observe that there are two 3-stars in the graph: 
<0, (4, 9)>
<3, (4, 5, 6)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
