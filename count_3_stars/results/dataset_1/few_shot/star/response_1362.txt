Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, creating a 3-star pattern with that node as the central node.

Looking at the adjacency list provided, we can identify the following 3-stars:
- <0, (7, 8)>
- <1, (4, 7, 8)>
- <2, (3, 7)>
- <3, (2, 4, 5)>
- <4, (1, 3, 6)>
- <7, (0, 1, 2)>
- <8, (0, 1, 4)>

Therefore, there are a total of [7] 3-stars in the given graph.
