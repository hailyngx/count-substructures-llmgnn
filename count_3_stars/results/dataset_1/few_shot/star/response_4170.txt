Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will act as the centers of the 3-stars.

Based on the provided adjacency list, the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes are:
- Node 1: connected to nodes 0, 6, and 8
- Node 2: connected to nodes 0, 5, and 6
- Node 6: connected to nodes 1, 2, and 7

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph. 

The number of 3-stars is [4].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (0, 6, 8)>
<2, (0, 5, 6)>
<6, (1, 2, 7)>
<7, (6, 8, 9)>
