Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 1

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for each node's neighbors and see if there is a 3-star centered at that node. A 3-star is formed when one node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Looking at the given information:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 9. It forms two 3-stars: <0, (1, 4, 9)> and <0, (3, 6, 8)>.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 5, and 9. It forms one 3-star: <1, (0, 5, 9)>.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 7 and 8. It does not form any 3-star since it is not connected to exactly three nodes.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0 and 4. It does not form any 3-star since it is not connected to exactly three nodes.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 6. It forms one 3-star: <4, (0, 3, 6)>.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 7, and 8. It does not form any 3-star since it is not connected to exactly three nodes.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 7. It forms one 3-star: <6, (0, 4, 7)>.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 6. It forms one 3-star: <7, (2, 5, 6)>.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 5. It forms one 3-star: <8, (0, 2, 5)>.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 0 and 1. It does not form any 3-star since it is not connected to exactly three nodes.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5]. 
The unique 3-stars found are <0, (1, 4, 9)>, <0, (3, 6, 8)>, <1, (0, 5, 9)>, <4, (0, 3, 6)>, and <7, (2, 5, 6)>.
