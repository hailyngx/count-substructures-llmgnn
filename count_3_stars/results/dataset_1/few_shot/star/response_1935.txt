Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for each node that has exactly three neighbors and then determine if those neighbors form a 3-star centered at that node. 

Based on the adjacency list and the definition of a 3-star, we can identify the following 3-stars:

<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<1, (0, 6, 9)>
<4, (5, 8, 9)>
<7, (0, 2, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
