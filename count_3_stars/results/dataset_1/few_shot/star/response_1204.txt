Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 8

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph based on the definition provided.

First, let's list all the nodes connected to each node:
- Node 0: 2
- Node 1: 7, 9
- Node 2: 0, 3, 4
- Node 3: 2, 5, 6, 7
- Node 4: 2, 5, 6, 7
- Node 5: 3, 4
- Node 6: 3, 4, 8
- Node 7: 1, 3, 4
- Node 8: 6, 9
- Node 9: 1, 8

Next, let's identify the 3-star configurations where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 4, 3: <2, (0, 4, 3)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 6, 7: <3, (5, 6, 7)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 6, 7: <4, (5, 6, 7)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 4, 8: <6, (3, 4, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: <2, (0, 4, 3)>, <3, (5, 6, 7)>, <4, (5, 6, 7)>, <6, (3, 4, 8)>.
