Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 5) (9, 7)

Response:
To count the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through the nodes one by one:

1. Node 0:
    - Node 0 forms a 3-star: <0, (2, 3, 4)>
    - Node 0 does not form more 3-stars since it has more than 4 neighbors.

2. Node 1:
    - Node 1 does not form any 3-stars since it has less than 3 neighbors.

3. Node 2:
    - Node 2 forms a 3-star: <2, (0, 1, 3)>
    - Node 2 does not form more 3-stars since it has more than 4 neighbors.

4. Node 3:
    - Node 3 forms a 3-star: <3, (0, 1, 2)>
    - Node 3 does not form more 3-stars since it has more than 4 neighbors.

5. Node 4:
    - Node 4 does not form any 3-stars since it has less than 3 neighbors.

6. Node 5:
    - Node 5 does not form any 3-stars since it has more than 4 neighbors.

7. Node 6:
    - Node 6 does not form any 3-stars since it has less than 3 neighbors.

8. Node 7:
    - Node 7 does not form any 3-stars since it has more than 4 neighbors.

9. Node 8:
    - Node 8 does not form any 3-stars since it has more than 4 neighbors.

10. Node 9:
    - Node 9 does not form any 3-stars since it has more than 4 neighbors.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
