Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 7

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

From the adjacency list, we can see the connections as follows:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with (0, 6, 1, 1) as the central node and nodes 6, 1, and 1 as the leaves.
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with (1, 5, 6, 8) as the central node and nodes 5, 6, and 8 as the leaves.
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with (3, 5, 6, 9) as the central node and nodes 5, 6, and 9 as the leaves.
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with (5, 1, 3, 8) as the central node and nodes 1, 3, and 8 as the leaves.
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with (6, 0, 1, 7) as the central node and nodes 0, 1, and 7 as the leaves.
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with (9, 2, 3, 4) as the central node and nodes 2, 3, and 4 as the leaves.

Therefore, the 3-stars in the given graph are:
<0, (0, 6, 1, 1)>, <1, (1, 5, 6, 8)>, <3, (3, 5, 6, 9)>, <5, (5, 1, 3, 8)>, <6, (6, 0, 1, 7)>, <9, (9, 2, 3, 4)>

Count of 3-stars: [6]
