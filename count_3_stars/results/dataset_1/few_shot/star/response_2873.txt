Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 3

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern. 
Let's analyze the graph and identify the 3-star patterns:

1. Node 0: (1, 2, 7) 
2. Node 1: (0, 2, 9)
3. Node 2: (0, 1, 5)
4. Node 2: (0, 1, 6)
5. Node 5: (2, 8, -)
6. Node 6: (2, 7, 8)
7. Node 6: (7, 8, -)
8. Node 8: (4, 5, 6)
9. Node 9: (1, 3, -)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9]. 
The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (1, 2, 7)>
<1, (0, 2, 9)>
<2, (0, 1, 5)>
<2, (0, 1, 6)>
<5, (2, 8, -)>
<6, (2, 7, 8)>
<6, (7, 8, -)>
<8, (4, 5, 6)>
<9, (1, 3, -)>
