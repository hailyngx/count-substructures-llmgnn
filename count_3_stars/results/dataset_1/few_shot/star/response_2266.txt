Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 6

Response:
Based on the description of the graph, we can identify the 3-star structures by finding nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list down the 3-stars we can find in the graph:

<0, (3, 5, 2)>
<1, (9, 3, 4)>
<2, (5, 0, 4)>
<3, (0, 6, 9)>
<4, (5, 9, 2)>
<5, (0, 4, 6)>
<6, (3, 5, 8)>
<7, (5, 8, 0)>
<8, (6, 7, 5)>
<9, (1, 3, 4)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
