Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 6

Response:
