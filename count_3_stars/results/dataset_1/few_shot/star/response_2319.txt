Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 5
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify them. 

A 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. We can navigate through the adjacency list of each node to find all 3-stars.

Let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (2, 3, 5)>
<1, (8, 9, -)>
<8, (1, 4, 9)>
<9, (1, 3, 8)>

Count of 3-stars = [4]
