Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 2

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star around that node. 

Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (4, 6, )>
2. <2, (3, 4, 8)>
3. <4, (0, 2, 8)>
4. <5, (4, 7, )>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
