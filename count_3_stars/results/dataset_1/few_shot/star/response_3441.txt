Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a 3-star pattern. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<2, (4, 7, 9)>
<4, (0, 2, 8)>
<9, (1, 2, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: 
<2, (4, 7, 9)>
<4, (0, 2, 8)>
<9, (1, 2, 6)>
