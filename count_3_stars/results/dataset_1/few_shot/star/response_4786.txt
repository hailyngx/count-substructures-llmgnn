Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node acts as the center of a 3-star. We can do this by checking each node to see if it is connected to exactly three other nodes.

In this graph, the nodes and their connections are as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 6, and 7.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2 and 7.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0 and 1.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 7, 8, and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 3 and 6.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 8 and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0 and 4.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 3.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 3 and 5.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 3 and 5.

From the above information, we can see that the following nodes act as the center of a 3-star: 
- Node 0 with leaves 2, 6, 7
- Node 3 with leaves 4, 7, 8
- Node 5 with leaves 8, 9

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
  
The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 6, 7)>, <3, (4, 7, 8)>, <5, (8, 9)>
