Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 8

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph. 
A 3-star graph has a center node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

After examining the graph, we can identify the following 3-star graphs:
1. <1, (3, 5, 8)>
2. <3, (1, 8, 9)>
3. <5, (1, 2, 4)>
4. <7, (2, 4, 5)>
5. <8, (1, 3, 7)>
6. <9, (3, 7, 8)>

Lastly, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph.
