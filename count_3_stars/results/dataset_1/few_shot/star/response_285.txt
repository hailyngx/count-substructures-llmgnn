Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 7

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star subgraphs in the given graph:

1. <0, (1, 3, 4)>
2. <0, (1, 3, 5)>
3. <0, (1, 4, 9)>
4. <0, (1, 5, 7)>
5. <1, (0, 2, 9)>
6. <3, (0, 1, 5)>
7. <4, (0, 6, 9)>
8. <5, (0, 3, 7)>
9. <7, (1, 3, 5)>
10. <9, (0, 1, 4)>
