Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: Identify nodes with exactly 3 neighbors, which are potential central nodes of 3-stars.
- Nodes 2, 3, and 8 have less than 3 neighbors.
- Nodes 0, 4, and 8 have more than 3 neighbors.

Step 2: Find 3-stars using potential central nodes.
- For node 1: <1, (0, 4, 5)>
- For node 5: <5, (1, 6, 9)>
- For node 7: <7, (4, 6, 9)>

[The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 3.]
