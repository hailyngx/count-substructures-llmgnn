Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star structure.

Looking at the adjacency list provided, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (3, 6, 7)>
<0, (3, 6, 8)>
<0, (3, 7, 8)>
<0, (6, 7, 8)>
<1, (3, 6, 8)>
<2, (3, 6, 8)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<4, (6, 8, 9)>
<6, (0, 1, 2)>
<8, (0, 1, 2)>

Counting all unique 3-stars found, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
