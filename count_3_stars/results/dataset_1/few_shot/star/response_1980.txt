Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern.

Looking at the adjacency list for each node, we can identify the following 3-stars:
1. <0, (1, 7, 3)>
2. <1, (0, 2, 8)>
3. <2, (1, 3, 4)>
4. <3, (2, 7, 8)>
5. <5, (6, 7, 0)>
6. <6, (5, 7, 9)>
7. <7, (0, 3, 6)>
8. <8, (1, 2, 9)>
9. <9, (6, 8, 5)>

Therefore, there are [9] 3-stars in this graph.
