Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 5

Response:
There are <1, (4, 6, 7)>, <1, (4, 8, 9)>, and <5, (4, 7, 9)> 3-stars in the given graph.  
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [3].
