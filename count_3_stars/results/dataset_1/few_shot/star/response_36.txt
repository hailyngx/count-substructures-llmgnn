Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the unique 3-stars present in the graph. 

After analyzing the given graph, we find the following 3-stars:
<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<0, (2, 4, 7)>
<0, (3, 4, 7)>
<0, (4, 7, 8)>
<4, (8, 9, 4)>
<6, (7, 8, 6)>
<7, (6, 8, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
