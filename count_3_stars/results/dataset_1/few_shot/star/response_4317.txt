Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify 3-stars by finding central nodes connected to exactly three other nodes. Here are the steps to find and count the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Identify Nodes Connected to Three Neighbors:
   - Based on the adjacency list, the nodes connected to exactly three other nodes are:
     - Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 9.
     - Node 3 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 7.
     - Node 6 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 8.
     - Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 8.

2. Form Unique 3-Stars:
   - Based on the identified nodes connected to three other nodes, we can form the following unique 3-stars:
     - <0, (1, 5, 9)>
     - <3, (5, 6, 7)>
     - <6, (3, 5, 8)>
     - <9, (2, 4, 8)>

3. Count the Number of 3-Stars:
   - There are 4 unique 3-stars found.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
