Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, and node 7

Response:
Let's first identify all the 3-stars in the given graph:
- For Node 0: <0, (3, 4, 5)>, <0, (3, 4, 9)>, <0, (3, 5, 9)>, <0, (4, 5, 9)>
- For Node 1: <1, (6, 9, 0)>
- For Node 2: <2, (6, 7, 8)>, <2, (6, 7, 9)>, <2, (6, 8, 9)>, <2, (7, 8, 5)>, <2, (7, 8, 9)>, <2, (7, 5, 9)>, <2, (8, 5, 9)>
- For Node 3: <3, (0, 4, 6)>
- For Node 4: <4, (0, 3, 9)>
- For Node 5: <5, (0, 7, 9)>, <5, (0, 8, 9)>, <5, (7, 8, 9)>
- For Node 6: No 3-star associated.
- For Node 7: <7, (2, 5, 9)>
- For Node 8: No 3-star associated.
- For Node 9: <9, (0, 4, 5)>, <9, (0, 4, 7)>, <9, (0, 5, 7)>, <9, (4, 5, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [18].
