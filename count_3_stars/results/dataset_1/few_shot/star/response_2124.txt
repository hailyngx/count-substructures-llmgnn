Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 7) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, following the definition of a 3-star graph. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we can see that the nodes connected to exactly three other nodes are:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 6, and 9
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1 and 7
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0 and 8
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 3 and 4

Let's list all the unique 3-stars in this graph:
<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<0, (1, 5, 9)>
<0, (1, 6, 9)>
<1, (0, 3, 7)>
<3, (1, 7, 4)>
<6, (0, 8, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
