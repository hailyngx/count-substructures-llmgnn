Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 0) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star-like pattern.

The nodes connected to three other nodes are: 
- Node 0 connects to nodes 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, and 9
- Node 1 connects to nodes 0 and 6
- Node 4 connects to nodes 0 and 8
- Node 6 connects to nodes 1 and 7
- Node 7 connects to nodes 0 and 6
- Node 8 connects to nodes 0 and 4
- Node 9 connects to nodes 0 and 5

Based on the connections, we can identify the 3-stars present in the graph:
<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<0, (1, 4, 7)>
<0, (1, 8, 9)>
<0, (2, 8, 9)>
<0, (4, 7, 8)>
<1, (0, 6, 7)>
<4, (0, 8, 9)>
<7, (0, 6, 1)>
<8, (0, 4, 2)>
<9, (0, 8, 1)>

Therefore, there are [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
