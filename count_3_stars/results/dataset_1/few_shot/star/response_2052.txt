Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 10 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (2, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 5
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 9
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will first identify all possible 3-stars. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Given the adjacency list and edge list provided, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 8 (Central Node) is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 9. <8, (0, 4, 9)>
2. Node 4 (Central Node) is connected to nodes 8, 9, and 8. <4, (8, 9, 8)>
3. Node 9 (Central Node) is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 4. <9, (4, 6, 4)>

Therefore, there are [3] 3-stars in the given graph. 

Final answer: [3]
