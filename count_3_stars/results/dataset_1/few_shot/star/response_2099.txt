Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 3

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern.

Here are the 3-star patterns in the graph:

<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<2, (1, 7, 9)>
<3, (2, 4, 5)>
<4, (0, 3, 6)>
<7, (0, 2, 5)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars gives us a total of [5].
