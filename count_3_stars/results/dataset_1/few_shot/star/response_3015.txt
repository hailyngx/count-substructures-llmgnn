Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 5

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are:

<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<3, (0, 4, 5)>
<4, (2, 3, 5)>
<5, (4, 9, 0)>
<9, (4, 5, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [5].
