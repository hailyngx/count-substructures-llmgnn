Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a 3-star pattern. 

Let's list down the 3-stars in the given graph:

<1, (2, 3, 9)>
<2, (1, 9, 9)>
<3, (1, 4, 7)>
<4, (3, 6, 8)>
<9, (2, 5, 6)>
<9, (2, 5, 8)>
<9, (2, 6, 8)>
