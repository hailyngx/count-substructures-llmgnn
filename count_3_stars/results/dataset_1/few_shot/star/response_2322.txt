Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 9) (2, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 9
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 5, and node 8

Response:
First, let's find all the 3-stars in the graph. To do this, we look for nodes that have exactly 3 neighbors since a 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

The nodes with 3 neighbors are: 0, 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9.

Now, we will list the 3-stars that can be formed using these nodes:
<0, (4, 5, 7)>
<4, (0, 7, 9)>
<5, (0, 9, 4)>
<7, (0, 4, 8)>
<8, (6, 7, 9)>
<9, (1, 2, 4)>
<9, (1, 2, 5)>
<9, (1, 2, 8)>

Count of 3-stars: [8]
