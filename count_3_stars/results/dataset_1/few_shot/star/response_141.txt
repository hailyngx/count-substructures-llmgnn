Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can identify each 3-star by looking for nodes that have exactly three neighbors connected to them. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we can identify the three nodes that have exactly three neighbors:
- Node 1: Connected to nodes 0, 4, 5
- Node 2: Connected to nodes 0, 3, 4
- Node 6: Connected to nodes 0, 5, 7

Each of these nodes forms a 3-star, so we have found three unique 3-stars in the graph. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].

<1, (0, 4, 5)>
<2, (0, 3, 4)>
<6, (0, 5, 7)>
