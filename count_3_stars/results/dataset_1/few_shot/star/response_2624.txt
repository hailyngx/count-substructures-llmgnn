Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node and its three connected nodes for each 3-star pattern.

Given the adjacency list, we can see that the nodes with 3 connections are nodes 1, 3, and 8. These nodes can act as the center of the 3-stars.

Let's find the 3-stars using these central nodes:
1. For node 1: (1, 2, 7), (1, 5, 9), (1, 7, 8), (1, 8, 0)
2. For node 3: (3, 2, 6), (3, 4, 8), (3, 6, 8), (3, 8, 0)
3. For node 8: (8, 0, 1), (8, 3, 4), (8, 4, 6), (8, 6, 2)

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [11].

Unique 3-stars:
<1, (2, 7, 8)>
<1, (5, 8, 9)>
<1, (7, 1, 8)>
<1, (8, 0, 1)>
<3, (2, 6, 3)>
<3, (4, 8, 3)>
<3, (6, 3, 8)>
<3, (8, 0, 3)>
<8, (0, 1, 8)>
<8, (3, 4, 8)>
<8, (4, 6, 8)>
<8, (6, 2, 8)>
