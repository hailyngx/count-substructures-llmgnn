Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to find all the 3-stars present. 

Given the definition, a 3-star has a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. We can see that each node in this graph is connected to multiple other nodes. We need to identify the combinations where one node is the center of a 3-star and the other three nodes are connected to it.

Let's go through each node's connections to find the 3-stars:
- Node 0: (0, 3, 4, 7)
- Node 1: (1, 3, 6)
- Node 2: (2, 3, 8)
- Node 3: (3, 0, 1, 2), (3, 4, 6), (3, 8, 9)
- Node 4: (4, 0, 3, 6)
- Node 5: (5, 8, 9)
- Node 6: (6, 1, 3, 4, 7)
- Node 7: (7, 0, 6)
- Node 8: (8, 2, 3, 5, 9)
- Node 9: (9, 3, 5, 8)

Based on the above connections, we can see the unique 3-stars present in the graph:
<0, (3, 4, 7)>
<1, (3, 6, 0)>
<2, (3, 8, 0)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<3, (4, 6, 0)>
<0, (3, 4, 6)>
<6, (1, 3, 4)>
<8, (3, 9, 5)>
<5, (8, 9, 3)>

Count of 3-stars: [9]
