Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars below:

<0, (4, 5, 7)>
<3, (2, 4, 5)>
<4, (0, 3, 5)>
<5, (0, 3, 4)>
<7, (0, 2, 6)>
<8, (3, 5, 9)>

Count of 3-stars: [6]
