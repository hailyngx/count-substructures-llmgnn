Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern.

Looking at the adjacency list for each node, we can identify the following unique 3-stars:
<1, (7, 8, 9)>
<5, (0, 3, 4)>
<5, (3, 6, 7)>
<5, (4, 6, 7)>
<8, (1, 4, 9)>

Therefore, there are a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
