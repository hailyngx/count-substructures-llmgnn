Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern.

After examining the provided information, we can determine that the 3-star graphs in this network are as follows:
<0, (2, 7, 9)>
<1, (6, 7, 8)>
<2, (0, 3, 7)>
<3, (2, 7, 0)>
<4, (5, 9, 0)>
<5, (4, 9, 0)>
<6, (1, 9, 8)>
<7, (0, 1, 3)>
<8, (1, 9, 6)>
<9, (0, 5, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
