Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars present. 

Based on the definition of a 3-star graph and the provided information, let's find the 3-stars:

We can list the 3-stars in the following format:

<Center Node, (Leaf Node 1, Leaf Node 2, Leaf Node 3)>

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the given graph:

<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<0, (4, 5, 7)>
<0, (3, 5, 7)>
<5, (0, 2, 7)>
<5, (0, 7, 8)>
<5, (2, 7, 8)>
<8, (1, 3, 9)>
<8, (4, 5, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
