Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 1) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify sets of nodes that form 3-star structures around a central node.

Let's first identify the nodes that can act as central nodes in a 3-star:

1. From the adjacency lists, the potential central nodes are: 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, and 9. 

Now, let's list out the unique 3-stars in the graph <center, (leaf1, leaf2, leaf3)>:

<1, (2, 3, 5)>
<1, (3, 2, 7)>
<1, (5, 6, 7)>
<1, (6, 7, 8)>
<1, (7, 8, 9)>
<2, (1, 3, 4)>
<2, (1, 3, 9)>
<2, (3, 1, 4)>
<2, (3, 1, 9)>
<7, (1, 9, 8)>
<7, (9, 1, 8)>
<8, (1, 9, 7)>
<8, (9, 1, 7)>
<9, (2, 7, 8)>
<9, (7, 2, 8)>
<9, (7, 8, 1)>
<9, (8, 7, 1)>

Counting the unique 3-stars in the graph, we find that there are [17] such structures.
