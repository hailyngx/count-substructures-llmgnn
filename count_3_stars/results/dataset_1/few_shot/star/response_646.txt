Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will look for each node that acts as the center of a 3-star. 

For each node, we will check if it is connected to exactly 3 other nodes. If this condition is met, we will identify the 3-star pattern it forms with its connected nodes.

Here are the unique 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (2, 6, 9)>
<1, (3, 5, 9)>
<2, (0, 9, 3)>
<3, (1, 5, 9)>
<5, (1, 3, 6)>
<6, (0, 5, 9)>
<9, (0, 2, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
