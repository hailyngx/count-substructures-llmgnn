Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 2

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph can be found by looking for nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them. Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph step by step:

1. Node 0 does not have exactly three edges, so it's not part of any 3-star.

2. Node 1 has exactly three edges (to nodes 2, 4) but none are a valid 3-star since there are not three leaf nodes connected to it.

3. Node 2 has exactly three edges (to nodes 1, 4, 5) forming a 3-star: <2, (1, 4, 5)>.

4. Node 3 has exactly three edges (to nodes 4, 6, 7) forming a 3-star: <3, (4, 6, 7)>.

5. Node 4 has more than three edges connected to it, so it's not part of any 3-star.

6. Node 5 does not have exactly three edges, so it's not part of any 3-star.

7. Node 6 does not have exactly three edges, so it's not part of any 3-star.

8. Node 7 does not have exactly three edges, so it's not part of any 3-star.

9. Node 8 does not have exactly three edges, so it's not part of any 3-star.

10. Node 9 does not have exactly three edges, so it's not part of any 3-star.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<2, (1, 4, 5)>
<3, (4, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
