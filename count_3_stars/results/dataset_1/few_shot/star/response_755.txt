Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 3

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Based on the adjacency list and the definition of a 3-star graph, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

<1, (5, 6, 9)>
<2, (3, 4, 5)>
<3, (2, 9, **empty**)> (Node 3 is connected to 2 and 9, but does not have a third connection to complete the 3-star)
<4, (2, 7, **empty**)> (Node 4 is connected to 2 and 7, but does not have a third connection to complete the 3-star)
<5, (1, 2, 7)>
<6, (1, **empty**, **empty**)> (Node 6 is only connected to node 1, so it does not form a 3-star)
<7, (0, 2, 4)>
<8, (2, **empty**, **empty**)> (Node 8 is only connected to node 2, so it does not form a 3-star)
<9, (1, 2, 3)>

From the identified 3-stars above, we can see that there are 7 unique 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is: [7]

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (5, 6, 9)>
<2, (3, 4, 5)>
<5, (1, 2, 7)>
<7, (0, 2, 4)>
<9, (1, 2, 3)>
