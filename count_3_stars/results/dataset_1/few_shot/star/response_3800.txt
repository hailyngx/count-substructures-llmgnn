Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 5

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes by edges. 

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 6, and 9 <2, (3, 6, 9)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 2, and 9 <3, (0, 2, 9)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 7, and 9 <5, (6, 7, 9)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 5, and 8 <7, (4, 5, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

<2, (3, 6, 9)>
<3, (0, 2, 9)>
<5, (6, 7, 9)>
<7, (4, 5, 8)>
