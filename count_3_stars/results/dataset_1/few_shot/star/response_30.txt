Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 7

Response:
Given the graph information, we can count the number of 3-stars by examining each node to see if it is the center of a 3-star. 

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (2, 3, 1)>
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<2, (3, 0, 1)>
<2, (1, 0, 3)>
<3, (0, 2, 4)>
<7, (2, 6, 9)>
<7, (6, 2, 9)>
<7, (2, 8, 9)>
<7, (8, 2, 9)>
<7, (2, 8, 9)>
<7, (8, 2, 9)>

Count of 3-stars: [11]
