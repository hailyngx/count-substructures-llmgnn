Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 6, 7, and node 8

Response:
Let's find the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

We will search for each potential central node and count the number of 3-stars around it.

For Node 0:
- 3-stars: <0, (1, 4, 5)>, <0, (1, 5, 6)>
  
For Node 1:
- 3-stars: <1, (0, 2, 5)>

For Node 2:
- 3-stars: <2, (1, 5, 6)>

For Node 3:
- No 3-stars

For Node 4:
- No 3-stars

For Node 5:
- 3-stars: <5, (0, 1, 2)>

For Node 6:
- No 3-stars

For Node 7:
- No 3-stars

For Node 8:
- No 3-stars

For Node 9:
- No 3-stars

Count of 3-stars = 3

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
