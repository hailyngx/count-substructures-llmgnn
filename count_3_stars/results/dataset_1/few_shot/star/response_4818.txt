Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 6
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 7

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are as follows: 
<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<1, (0, 3, 7)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<5, (1, 9, -)>
<6, (3, 9, -)>
