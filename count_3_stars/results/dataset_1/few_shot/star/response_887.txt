Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through each node and find the 3-stars:

1. Node 0: No 3-stars (Connected to 2 nodes - 1, 5, 9)
2. Node 1: One 3-star <1, (0, 5, 9)> (1 is the center, connected to 0, 5, 9)
3. Node 2: No 3-stars (Connected to 2 nodes - 3, 5)
4. Node 3: No 3-stars (Connected to 4 nodes - 1, 2, 4, 8)
5. Node 4: No 3-stars (Connected to 2 nodes - 3, 5, 9)
6. Node 5: Two 3-stars <5, (0, 1, 4)> and <5, (8, 9, 10)> (5 is the center, connected to 0, 1, 4) and (5 is the center, connected to 8, 9, 10)
7. Node 6: No 3-stars (Connected to 1 node - 1)
8. Node 7: No 3-stars (Connected to 3 nodes - 3, 8, 9)
9. Node 8: No 3-stars (Connected to 4 nodes - 1, 3, 5, 7)
10. Node 9: No 3-stars (Connected to 2 nodes - 0, 4, 5, 7)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3]. 

<1, (0, 5, 9)>, <5, (0, 1, 4)>, <5, (8, 9, 10)>
