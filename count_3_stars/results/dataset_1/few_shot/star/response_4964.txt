Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 6
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

Unique 3-stars: 
<0, (2, 5, 6)>
<2, (0, 1, 5)>
<5, (0, 2, 6)>
<6, (2, 5, 9)>
