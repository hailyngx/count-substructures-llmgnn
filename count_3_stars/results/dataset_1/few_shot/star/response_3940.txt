Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 5
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 0

Response:
Based on the given graph and the definition of a 3-star graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the 3-star configurations:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 7
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 5
3. Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 5
4. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 7
5. Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 5

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in this given graph are:
<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<1, (0, 4, 5)>
<4, (1, 2, 5)>
<5, (0, 4, 7)>
<7, (0, 3, 5)>

Count of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
