Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the 3-stars. 

Here are the 3-stars identified with their central node and leaf nodes:
<1, (2, 7, 8)>
<2, (1, 4, 9)>
<4, (2, 5, 9)>
<5, (6, 8, 9)>
<6, (0, 5, 7)>
<7, (1, 6, 8)>
<8, (5, 7, 9)>
<9, (4, 5, 8)>

Count of 3-stars: [8]
