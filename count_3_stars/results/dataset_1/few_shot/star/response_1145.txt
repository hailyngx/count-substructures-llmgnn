Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 3

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (0, 2, 5)>
