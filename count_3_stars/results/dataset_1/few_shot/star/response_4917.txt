Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all unique 3-stars present in the graph.

Given the definition of a 3-star graph, we are looking for subgraphs where one node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Observing the adjacency list:
- Node 3 is connected to 5, 6, and 8
- Node 5 is connected to 1, 7, and 9
- Node 8 is connected to 4, 5, and 9

Thus, we have identified three unique 3-stars:
<3, (5, 6, 8)>
<5, (1, 7, 9)>
<8, (4, 5, 9)>

Count of 3-stars in the given graph: [3]
