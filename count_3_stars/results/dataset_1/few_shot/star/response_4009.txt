Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 4, and node 8

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 4, 9)>
<2, (0, 4, 9)>
<3, (1, 5, 9)>
<4, (1, 2, 9)>
<9, (0, 2, 8)>
