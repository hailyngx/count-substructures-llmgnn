Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 8

Response:
There are 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

Here is the list of unique 3-stars: 
<0, (2, 5, 8)>
<1, (2, 5, 0)>
<2, (4, 3, 9)>
<2, (3, 4, 9)>
<8, (0, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
