Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-star structures in the graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes (forming a 3-star configuration).

Given the adjacency list and edge information, we can identify the 3-stars in this graph:

<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<2, (0, 1, 7)>
<4, (1, 9, 0)>
<5, (0, 9, 6)>
<6, (1, 9, 5)>
<7, (2, 9, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
