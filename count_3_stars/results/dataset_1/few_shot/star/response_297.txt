Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star. A 3-star consists of a center node and three leaf nodes connected to the center.

Let's go through each node in the graph to find the 3-stars:

- Node 0: No 3-star can be formed as it has only one neighbor.
- Node 1: No 3-star can be formed as it has two neighbors only.
- Node 2: No 3-star can be formed as it has multiple neighbors, but not in the required configuration.
- Node 3: No 3-star can be formed as it has two neighbors only.
- Node 4: <4, (2, 5, 7)> - forms a 3-star.
- Node 5: <5, (1, 2, 4)>, <5, (2, 4, 7)>, <5, (4, 6, 7)> - forms three 3-stars.
- Node 6: No 3-star can be formed as it has multiple neighbors, but not in the required configuration.
- Node 7: <7, (2, 4, 5)>, <7, (4, 5, 8)> - forms two 3-stars.
- Node 8: No 3-star can be formed as it has multiple neighbors, but not in the required configuration.
- Node 9: No 3-star can be formed as it has two neighbors only.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: <4, (2, 5, 7)>, <5, (1, 2, 4)>, <5, (2, 4, 7)>, <5, (4, 6, 7)>, <7, (2, 4, 5)>, <7, (4, 5, 8)>.
