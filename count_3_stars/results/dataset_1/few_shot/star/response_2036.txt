Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 6, and node 8

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
1. <0, (2, 6, 9)>
2. <1, (2, 6, 7)>
3. <2, (0, 1, 9)>
4. <3, (5, 6, 8)>
5. <4, (2, 8, 4)>
6. <5, (2, 3, 5)>
7. <6, (0, 1, 9)>
8. <8, (3, 4, 9)>
9. <9, (0, 2, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
