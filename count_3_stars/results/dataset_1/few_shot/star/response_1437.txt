Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the adjacency list provided, we can see which nodes have exactly three neighbors. These nodes will serve as the centers of the 3-stars.

Nodes with exactly three neighbors:
- Node 1 (connected to nodes 2, 3, 7)
- Node 7 (connected to nodes 1, 3, 4)

Now, we can list the 3-stars in the graph:
<1, (2, 3, 7)>
<7, (1, 3, 4)>

Count of 3-stars: [2]
