Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 8

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph using the information provided above. 

A 3-star is formed by a central node and three leaf nodes connected to the central node. We can start by looking at each node and its connections to identify if there are any 3-stars in the graph. 

Let's list the 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (1, 3, 6)>
<1, (0, 3, 9)>
<2, (8, 9)>
<3, (0, 1, 6)> 
<8, (2, 3, 9)>

Count of 3-stars in the graph: [5]
