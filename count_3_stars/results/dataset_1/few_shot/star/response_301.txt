Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that is central in a 3-star configuration. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. We will then check if each of these central nodes indeed forms a 3-star in the graph.

Let's start by identifying the central nodes and their corresponding leaves:
1. Node 0: (0, 2, 3, 5)
2. Node 1: (1, 5, 8, 9)
3. Node 2: (2, 0, 3, 5), (2, 6, 7, 9)
4. Node 3: (3, 0, 2, 5)
5. Node 4: (4, 5, 6)
6. Node 5: (5, 0, 1, 2), (5, 3, 4, 9)
7. Node 6: (6, 2, 4)
8. Node 7: (7, 2, 8)
9. Node 8: (8, 1, 7)
10. Node 9: (9, 1, 2, 5)

Now we will count the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph:
<number of 3-stars: [4]> 
<0, (2, 3, 5)>
<1, (5, 8, 9)>
<2, (0, 3, 5)>
<5, (0, 1, 2)>
