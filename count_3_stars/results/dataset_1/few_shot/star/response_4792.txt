Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 8

Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph, we need to identify all possible combinations of the center node and its three connected nodes that form a 3-star.

Based on the provided adjacency list and the definition of a 3-star graph, we can see that the only possible 3-stars in this graph are centered at nodes 0, 1, 3, and 5.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars we found:
<0, (1, 3, 8)>
<1, (0, 5, 8)>
<3, (0, 2, 7)>
<5, (1, 4, 9)>

By counting the number of unique 3-stars found, we can determine the total number of 3-star graphs in the given graph. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [4].
