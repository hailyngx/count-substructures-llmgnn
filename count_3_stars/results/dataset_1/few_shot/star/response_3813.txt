Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each possible 3-star configuration in the graph. 

Let's go through each node to check if it forms a 3-star with exactly three other nodes. We will list unique 3-stars inside <>.

1. Node 0:
   - Possible 3-stars:
     - <0, (1, 5, 9)>
     - <0, (5, 9, 1)>
     - <0, (9, 1, 5)>

2. Node 1:
   - Possible 3-stars:
     - <1, (0, 4, 5)>
     - <1, (4, 0, 5)>

3. Node 2:
   - No 3-star as it only has one neighbor.

4. Node 3:
   - No 3-star as it only has two neighbors.

5. Node 4:
   - Possible 3-star:
     - <4, (1, 2, 6)>
     - <4, (1, 6, 2)>
     - <4, (2, 6, 1)>

6. Node 5:
   - No additional 3-stars as all its neighbors are already covered in the previous cases.

7. Node 6:
   - No 3-star as it only has three neighbors.

8. Node 7:
   - No 3-star as it only has two neighbors.

9. Node 8:
   - No 3-star as it only has two neighbors.

10. Node 9:
    - No additional 3-stars as all its neighbors are already covered in the previous cases.
   
All possible unique 3-stars have been listed above. Counting them, we have found a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
