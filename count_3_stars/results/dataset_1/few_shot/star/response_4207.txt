Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each potential center node and check if it is connected to exactly three other nodes.

From the adjacency list provided, we can see that only nodes 0 and 2 satisfy the criteria of being connected to exactly three other nodes. 

For node 0:
- 0 is connected to nodes 5 and 9
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 8
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 8
Therefore, the 3-star centered at node 0 is <0, (5, 4, 9)>.

For node 2:
- 2 is connected to node 8
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 5
Therefore, the 3-star centered at node 2 is <2, (8, 3, 5)>.

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
The unique 3-stars found are <0, (5, 4, 9)> and <2, (8, 3, 5)>.
