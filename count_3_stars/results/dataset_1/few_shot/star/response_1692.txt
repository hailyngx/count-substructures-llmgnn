Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 5, and node 6
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. These instances represent the 3-stars.

Lets list the 3-stars below and count them at the end:

<0, (3, 8, 2)>
<1, (3, 5, 6)>
<2, (3, 5, 8)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<5, (1, 2, 3)>
<6, (1, 3, 9)>
<9, (5, 6, 7)>

Count of 3-stars: [7]
