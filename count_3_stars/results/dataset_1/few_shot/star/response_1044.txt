Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 4, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes which are not directly connected to each other.

Looking at the given graph, we can find the 3-stars as follows:

<0, (1, 2, 8)>
<0, (1, 2, 9)>
