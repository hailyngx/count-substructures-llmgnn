Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Starting from each node, we will check if it forms a 3-star with its neighbors. Here are the 3-stars found in the given graph:

[10]

<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<1, (0, 8, 9)>
<7, (0, 1, 8)>
<5, (0, 2, 9)>
