Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify all the vertices that are part of a 3-star pattern. In a 3-star, there is a center vertex connected to exactly three other vertices. 

In this graph, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<1, (2, 3, 7)>
<1, (2, 3, 9)>
<1, (7, 4, 8)>
<1, (7, 4, 9)>
<1, (3, 4, 9)>
<3, (1, 4, 6)>
<3, (1, 4, 9)>
<4, (3, 5, 7)>
<4, (3, 5, 9)>
<4, (7, 1, 8)>
<4, (7, 1, 9)>
<7, (1, 4, 9)>
<9, (2, 3, 4)>
<9, (3, 1, 7)>
<9, (4, 1, 7)>

Total number of 3-stars: [15]
