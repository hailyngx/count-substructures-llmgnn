Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 5
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the subgraphs where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's identify the 3-stars step-by-step:
1. Node 0: (0, 3, 4, 5)
2. Node 2: (2, 5, 7)
3. Node 3: (3, 0, 6, 7)
4. Node 4: (4, 0, 6, 7)
5. Node 5: (5, 0, 2, 6)
6. Node 6: (6, 3, 4, 5)
7. Node 7: (7, 2, 3, 4)

Therefore, we have identified the following 3-stars:
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<2, (5, 7)>
<3, (0, 6, 7)>
<4, (0, 6, 7)>
<5, (0, 2, 6)>
<6, (3, 4, 5)>
<7, (2, 3, 4)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars, we get: [7].
