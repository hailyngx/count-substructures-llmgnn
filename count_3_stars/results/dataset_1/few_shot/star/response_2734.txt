Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the nodes that act as the center of a 3-star. Since a 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes, we need to find nodes that have exactly three neighbors. 

From the adjacency list provided, the nodes with exactly three neighbors are:
- Node 1 (connected to nodes 0 and 9)
- Node 3 (connected to nodes 0, 5, and 8)
- Node 4 (connected to nodes 2, 5, and 8)
- Node 6 (connected to nodes 2 and 8)
- Node 9 (connected to nodes 1 and 8)

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:

[5]

Unique 3-stars:
<1, (0, 9)>
<3, (0, 5, 8)>
<4, (2, 5, 8)>
<6, (2, 8)>
<9, (1, 8)>
