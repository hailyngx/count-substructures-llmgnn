Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes. 

Let's list out the 3-stars found in the graph:
<1, (3, 4, 7)>
<3, (1, 2, 5)>
<3, (1, 5, 6)>
<3, (5, 7, 8)>
<3, (5, 8, 9)>
<5, (0, 1, 3)>
<5, (0, 7, 8)>
<5, (1, 3, 7)>
<5, (1, 7, 8)>
<5, (1, 8, 9)>
<5, (3, 7, 8)>
<9, (3, 5, 6)>

Count of 3-stars in the graph: [12]
