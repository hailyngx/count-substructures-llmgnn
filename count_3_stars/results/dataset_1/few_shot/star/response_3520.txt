Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 9
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 7

Response:
Let's first identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars in the graph are: 
<0, (3, 4, 7)>
<1, (3, 5, 7)>
<2, (3, 9, -)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<4, (0, 3, 5)>
<7, (0, 1, 9)>

Counting the number of 3-stars in the graph, we find that there are [6] 3-star graphs.
