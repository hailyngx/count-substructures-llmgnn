Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Let's list the 3-stars present in the graph:
<0, (1, 7, 9)>
<1, (0, 2, 5)>
<2, (1, 5, 6)>
<4, (1, 7, -)>
<5, (1, 2, 8)>
<6, (2, 9, -)>
<7, (0, 1, 4)>
<9, (0, 6, -)>

Count of 3-stars: [8]
