Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 7

Response:
We can find the 3-stars by looking for nodes that have exactly 3 neighbors and determining if they form a 3-star. Let's go through each node:

- Node 0 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: (0, 3, 4, 8). This forms a 3-star <2, (0, 4, 8)>.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors: (2, 6, 7, 8, 9). This forms a 3-star <3, (2, 6, 7)>.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: (2, 6, 7, 9). This forms a 3-star <4, (2, 6, 7)>.
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: (3, 4). This forms a 3-star <6, (3, 4, 5)>.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: (1, 3, 4, 9). This forms a 3-star <7, (1, 3, 4)>.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: (0, 2, 3). This forms a 3-star <8, (0, 2, 3)>.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: (3, 4, 5, 7). This forms a 3-star <9, (3, 4, 7)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 5.
So, the answer is [5].
The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (0, 4, 8)>
<3, (2, 6, 7)>
<4, (2, 6, 7)>
<6, (3, 4, 5)>
<7, (1, 3, 4)>
