Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (4, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first identify the central nodes in the graph by looking for nodes with exactly three neighbors. Then, for each central node, we find all possible combinations of its neighbors to form 3-stars.

The central nodes in this graph are Node 2 and Node 8 since they each have exactly three neighbors. Let's find the 3-stars for each central node:

For Node 2:
- <2, (4, 7, 8)>
- <2, (7, 4, 8)>
[2]

For Node 8:
- <8, (2, 5, 9)>
- <8, (2, 9, 5)>
[4]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2 + 4 = 6].
