Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars, we need to identify all instances where a node forms a 3-star with three other nodes. From the given graph, we can see that a 3-star can be formed from a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list down all unique 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (2, 3, 6)>
<0, (2, 3, 7)>
<0, (2, 6, 7)>
<0, (3, 6, 7)>
<1, (8, 9, _)>
<3, (0, 4, _)>
<5, (6, 7, _)>
<6, (0, 5, _)>
<7, (0, 5, _)>
<8, (1, 9, _)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars that can be formed in this graph:
