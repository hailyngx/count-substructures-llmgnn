Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 4, 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Looking at the adjacency information, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<1, (0, 3, 5)>
<3, (1, 5, 9)>
<5, (1, 2, 8)>
<9, (4, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
