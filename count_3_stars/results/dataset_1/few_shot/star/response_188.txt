Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, and node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the nodes that form 3-stars.

Looking at the adjacency list, we see that Node 0, Node 1, Node 3, and Node 9 are the only nodes that have exactly three neighbors each. 
Hence, the 3-stars in this graph can be formed by considering these nodes as centers and their neighbors as leaves.

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars:
- For Node 0: <0, (2, 5, 9)>
- For Node 1: <1, (6, 7, 9)>
- For Node 3: <3, (4, 5, 9)>
- For Node 9: <9, (0, 1, 2)>, <9, (3, 4, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
