Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first identify the central node and its connected nodes. Then we check if each connected node forms a 3-star with the central node and its other connected nodes.

In this graph, a 3-star is formed by a central node and three connected nodes. Let's determine the 3-stars:

Central Node: 
- Node 0 with connected nodes 6 and 7

3-star 1: <0, (6, 7)>
3-star 2: <3, (4, 6)>
3-star 3: <3, (4, 7)>
3-star 4: <3, (6, 7)>
3-star 5: <4, (3, 7)>
3-star 6: <4, (5, 7)>
3-star 7: <5, (4, 8)>
3-star 8: <6, (0, 3)>
3-star 9: <6, (3, 9)>
3-star 10: <7, (0, 2)>
3-star 11: <7, (3, 4)>
3-star 12: <7, (4, 8)>
3-star 13: <8, (5, 7)>
