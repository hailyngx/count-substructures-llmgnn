Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star by finding nodes that form this structure. 

Given the definition of a 3-star graph, we can see that node 0, node 1, node 4, and node 8 are potential centers of 3-stars as they each have exactly three connected nodes. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (1, 4, 8)>
<1, (0, 4, 9)>
<4, (0, 1, 5)>
<8, (0, 5, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is: [4].
