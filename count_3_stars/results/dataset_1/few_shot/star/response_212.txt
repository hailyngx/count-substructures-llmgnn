Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, 6, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern. 

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (1, 2, 7)>
<0, (1, 2, 9)>
<0, (1, 7, 9)>
<0, (2, 7, 9)>
<1, (0, 5, 6)>
<2, (0, 4, 7)>
<2, (0, 7, 9)>
<2, (4, 7, 9)>
<3, (4)>
<5, (1, 9)>
<6, (1, 7, 9)>
<7, (0, 2, 6)>
<7, (0, 2, 9)>
<7, (6, 9)>
<8, (9)>
<9, (0, 5, 6)>
<9, (0, 6, 7)>
<9, (2, 5, 6)>
<9, (2, 6, 7)>
<9, (5, 6, 7)>
