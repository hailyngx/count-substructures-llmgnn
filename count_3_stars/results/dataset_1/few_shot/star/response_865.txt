Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify each set of nodes that form a 3-star. 

Based on the given information, the unique 3-stars can be listed as follows:

<0, (1, 8, 9)>
<1, (0, 5, 7)>
<2, (4, 6, 9)>
<3, (5, 8)>
<4, (2, 5, 6)>
<5, (1, 3, 4)>
<6, (2, 4, 7)>
<7, (1, 2, 6)>
<8, (0, 1, 3)>
<9, (1, 2, 4)>

There are 10 unique 3-stars. 
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
