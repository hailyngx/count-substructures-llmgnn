Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 8

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's first identify the 3-stars in the graph:
<2, (3, 4, 8)>
<3, (1, 2, 6)>
<4, (2, 8, 5)>
<5, (8, 9, 2)>
<6, (0, 3, 7)>
<8, (2, 4, 5)>
<9, (2, 5, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
