Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 6
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 5

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

- From Node 0: <0, (2, 3)>
- From Node 1: <1, (2, 6)>
- From Node 2: <2, (0, 1, 3)>, <2, (3, 8, 9)>
- From Node 3: <3, (0, 2, 5)>, <3, (2, 6, 5)>
- From Node 5: <5, (3, 6, 7)>, <5, (6, 8, 9)>
- From Node 6: <6, (1, 3, 5)>

Count of 3-stars: [6]
