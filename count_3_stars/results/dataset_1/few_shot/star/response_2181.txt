Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern with that node as the center.

From the provided information, we can see that the nodes with exactly three neighbors are as follows:
- Node 1 (neighbors: 4, 7, 9)
- Node 8 (neighbors: 3, 6)
- Node 9 (neighbors: 1, 2, 7)

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<1, (4, 7, 9)>
<8, (3, 6, -)>
<9, (1, 2, 7)>

Count of 3-stars in the graph: [3]
