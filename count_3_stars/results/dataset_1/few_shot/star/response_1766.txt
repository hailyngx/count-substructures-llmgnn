Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 6) (2, 8) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 8
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 7, and node 8

Response:
To find the number of 3-star structures in the given graph, we look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will serve as the central nodes of the 3-stars. Let's identify them:

- Node 0 is connected to 2 nodes.
- Node 1 is connected to 1 node.
- Node 2 is connected to 1 node.
- Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
- Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
- Node 5 is connected to 1 node.
- Node 6 is connected to 4 nodes.
- Node 7 is connected to 3 nodes.
- Node 8 is connected to 4 nodes.
- Node 9 is connected to 2 nodes.

Therefore, nodes 0, 7, and 8 are the central nodes of the 3-stars in this graph because they are each connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<0, (6, 8, 1)>
<7, (6, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 2, 7)>

The total number of 3-star structures in the given graph is [3].
