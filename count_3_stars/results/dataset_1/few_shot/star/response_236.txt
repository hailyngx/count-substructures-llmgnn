Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 3
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible combinations of 3 nodes where one of them is the center and the other two are leaves connected to the center.

Let's first list all the 3-stars we can find in this graph:
<1, (2, 4, 5)>
<1, (3, 4, 5)>
<1, (4, 0, 8)>
<1, (4, 3, 8)>
<1, (4, 8, 9)>
<1, (5, 2, 1)>
<8, (0, 4, 9)>
<8, (0, 4, 1)>
<8, (0, 4, 3)>
<8, (1, 2, 5)>
<8, (1, 4, 3)>
<8, (1, 3, 4)>
<8, (3, 1, 8)>
<8, (4, 0, 1)>
<8, (4, 0, 9)>
<8, (4, 1, 3)>
<8, (4, 1, 5)>
<8, (4, 3, 1)>
<8, (4, 5, 1)>
<8, (9, 8, 0)>

Counting the total number of unique 3-stars, we find there are [19] 3-stars in the given graph.
