Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify sets of nodes that form the structure of a 3-star. Since a 3-star consists of a central node connected to three other nodes, we will search for such configurations in the graph.

Here are the unique 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<1, (0, 4, 6)>
<2, (0, 3, 4)>
<3, (0, 2, 8)>
<4, (1, 2, 7)>
<6, (1, 5, 7)>
<6, (1, 7, 8)>
<6, (1, 7, 9)>
<6, (5, 7, 8)>
<6, (5, 7, 9)>
<6, (7, 8, 9)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the given graph.
