Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 5, and node 8

Response:
Following the given information, we can locate the 3-star patterns within the graph and count the total number of such structures. 

Let's identify the 3-stars:

1. Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 8. So, <3, (1, 5, 8)> is a 3-star.
  
2. Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 9. So, <5, (1, 3, 9)> is a 3-star.

3. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 9. So, <8, (0, 3, 9)> is a 3-star.

Count of 3-stars: [3]
Unique 3-stars: <3, (1, 5, 8)>, <5, (1, 3, 9)>, <8, (0, 3, 9)>
