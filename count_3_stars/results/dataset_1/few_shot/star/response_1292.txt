Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each central node and their adjacent nodes to see if they form a 3-star configuration.

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (2, 5, 7)>
<1, (6, 3, 7)>
<2, (0, 7, 3)>
<3, (6, 7, 9)>
<4, (7)>
<5, (0)>
<6, (1, 3)>
<7, (2, 4, 9)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars found in the graph, we get [8].
