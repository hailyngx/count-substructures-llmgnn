Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 9) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

In this graph, the following nodes are connected to exactly three other nodes, forming 3-star graphs:
- Node 0: connected to nodes 1, 3, and 5
- Node 1: connected to nodes 0, 4, and 8
- Node 3: connected to nodes 0, 4, and 5
- Node 4: connected to nodes 1, 2, and 3

Now, let's count the unique 3-star graphs:
<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<1, (0, 4, 8)>
<3, (0, 4, 5)>
<4, (1, 2, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [4].
