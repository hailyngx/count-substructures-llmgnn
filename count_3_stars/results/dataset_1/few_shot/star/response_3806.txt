Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 7

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0: (1, 6, 7)
2. Node 1: (0, 8, 3)
3. Node 4: (7, 8, 9)
4. Node 5: (6, 8, 9)
5. Node 7: (0, 2, 4)
6. Node 8: (1, 3, 5)
