Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all possible 3-star configurations in the graph. 
Given the definition of a 3-star graph, we look for nodes that have exactly 3 neighbors connected to them.

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 0: (0, 1, 8), (0, 1, 9), (0, 4, 5), (0, 5, 8), (0, 5, 9)
2. Node 1: (0, 1, 5), (0, 1, 8), (0, 1, 9)
3. Node 5: (0, 1, 5), (0, 5, 8), (0, 5, 9), (1, 5, 6)
4. Node 6: (2, 5, 6), (3, 5, 6), (5, 6, 9)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].

<0, (1, 8, 9)>

<5, (0, 5, 8)>
<5, (0, 5, 9)>
<5, (1, 5, 6)>
<6, (2, 5, 6)>
<6, (3, 5, 6)>
<6, (5, 6, 9)>
