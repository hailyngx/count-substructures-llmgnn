Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern.

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
1. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 5, forming a 3-star: <8, (0, 2, 5)>
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 8, and 9, forming a 3-star: <1, (3, 8, 9)>
3. Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 8, and 1 (repeated), forming a 3-star: <3, (1, 8, 8)>
4. Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 7, forming a 3-star: <9, (1, 5, 7)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4]. 
The unique 3-stars are <8, (0, 2, 5)>, <1, (3, 8, 9)>, <3, (1, 8, 8)>, and <9, (1, 5, 7)>.
