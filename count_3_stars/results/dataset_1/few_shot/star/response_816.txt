Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 2

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first identify all possible 3-stars based on the definition provided. In a 3-star, there is a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Looking at the adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars:
1. (2, 3, 5, 7) - Node 2 as the central node connected to nodes 3, 5, and 7.
2. (2, 5, 7, 8) - Node 2 as the central node connected to nodes 5, 7, and 8.
3. (0, 5, 7, 8) - Node 0 as the central node connected to nodes 5, 7, and 8.
4. (1, 5, 8, 9) - Node 1 as the central node connected to nodes 5, 8, and 9.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
<2, (3, 5, 7)>
<0, (5, 7, 8)>
<1, (5, 8, 9)>
