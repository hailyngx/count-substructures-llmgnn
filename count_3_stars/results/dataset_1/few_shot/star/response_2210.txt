Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible 3-stars by finding the central node and its three connected nodes. 

Starting with Node 0:
- (0, 3, 1) - Not a 3-star since nodes 1 and 3 are connected.
- (0, 4, 5) - This forms a 3-star with Node 0 as the center.
- (0, 5, 4) - Same 3-star as before, order doesn't matter.
- (0, 8, 9) - This forms a 3-star with Node 0 as the center.
- (0, 9, 8) - Same 3-star as before, order doesn't matter.

Moving to Node 1:
- (1, 3, 0) - Not a 3-star since nodes 0 and 3 are connected.
- (1, 4, 5) - Not a 3-star since all nodes are already connected.

Moving to Node 2:
- (2, 8, 9) - This forms a 3-star with Node 2 as the center.
- (2, 9, 8) - Same 3-star as before, order doesn't matter.

Moving to Node 3:
- (3, 0, 1) - Not a 3-star since nodes 0 and 1 are connected.
- (3, 6, 4) - Not a 3-star since node 4 is already connected to node 6.

Moving to Node 4:
- (4, 0, 5) - Same 3-star as (0, 4, 5) or (0, 5, 4).
- (4, 1, 6) - Not a 3-star since all nodes are already connected.

Moving to Node 5:
- No new 3-stars from Node 5.

Moving to Node 6:
- No new 3-stars from Node 6.

Moving to Node 7:
- No new 3-stars from Node 7.

Moving to Node 8:
- (8, 0, 9) - Same 3-star as (0, 8, 9) or (0, 9, 8).
- (8, 2, 9) - Not a 3-star since nodes 2 and 9 are already connected.

Moving to Node 9:
- (9, 0, 8) - Same 3-star as (0, 8, 9) or (0, 9, 8).
- (9, 1, 2) - Not a 3-star since nodes 1 and 2 are connected.  

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4]. 

Unique 3-stars found: 
<0, (4, 5, 0)>
<0, (8, 9, 0)>
<2, (8, 9, 2)>
<8, (0, 9, 8)>
