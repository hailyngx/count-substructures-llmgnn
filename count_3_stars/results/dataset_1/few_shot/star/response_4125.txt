Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible 3-stars. 
Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (3, 5, 7)>
<1, (3, 7, 9)>
<3, (0, 1, 6)>
<4, (2, 5, 7)>
<7, (1, 4, 9)>
<9, (3, 4, 7)>

Therefore, there are a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
