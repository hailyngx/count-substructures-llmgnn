Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 6

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with exactly 3 neighbors, as these nodes are potential centers of 3-stars. Based on the given adjacency list, the nodes with exactly 3 neighbors are nodes 2, 4, and 7.

Next, let's find the 3-stars in the graph:

1. For node 2:
    <2, (3, 8, 9)>
    
2. For node 4:
    <4, (0, 7, 8)>
    
3. For node 7:
    <7, (0, 6, 8)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we have a total of [3] 3-stars in the given graph.
