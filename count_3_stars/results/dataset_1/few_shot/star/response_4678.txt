Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 3

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can identify each 3-star by considering the central node and the three leaves connected to it. 

From the adjacency list, we can see the connections for each node. Let's identify the 3-stars:

1. <0, (3, 6, 8)>
2. <1, (3, 4, 2)>
3. <2, (3, 4, 1)>
4. <3, (0, 1, 2)>
5. <4, (1, 2, 5)>
6. <5, (4, 7, )>
7. <6, (0, 3, 7)>
8. <7, (5, 6, )>
9. <8, (0, 6, )>
10. <9, (3, , )>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
