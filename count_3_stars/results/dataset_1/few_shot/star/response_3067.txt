Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 7

Response:
We will first identify all the 3-stars in the given graph. A 3-star is formed when a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. After identifying all the 3-stars, we will count them to provide the final answer.

The 3-stars in the given graph are:
<0, (4, 7, 9)>
<1, (3, 5, 9)>
<3, (1, 8, 0)>
<4, (0, 6, 8)>
<5, (1, 2, 7)>
<7, (0, 5, 9)>
<8, (3, 4, 0)>
<9, (1, 0, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
