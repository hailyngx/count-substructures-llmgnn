Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that has exactly three edges connecting it to other nodes. These nodes represent the center of possible 3-stars.

Based on the provided information, the nodes that meet this criteria are: Node 1, Node 3, Node 4, and Node 9.

Now, let's find the 3-stars in the graph:
- For Node 1: (1, 3, 4, 8), (1, 3, 4, 9)
- For Node 3: (3, 1, 7, 9), (3, 4, 7, 9)
- For Node 4: (4, 1, 5, 7), (4, 1, 7, 9)
- For Node 9: (9, 1, 3, 4)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (3, 4, 8)>
<1, (3, 4, 9)>
<3, (1, 7, 9)>
<3, (4, 7, 9)>
<4, (1, 5, 7)>
<4, (1, 7, 9)>
<9, (1, 3, 4)>
