Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 6) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 8

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph.

Node 0 forms the following 3-stars:
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<0, (3, 5, 7)>

Node 3 forms the following 3-stars:
<3, (0, 5, 9)>
  
Node 4 forms the following 3-stars:
<4, (0, 6, 8)>

Node 5 forms the following 3-stars:
<5, (0, 3, 7)>

Node 7 forms the following 3-stars:
<7, (0, 5, 9)>

Node 8 forms the following 3-stars:
<8, (4, 9, 0)>

So, the total number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [6]. 
The unique 3-stars are <0, (3, 4, 5)>, <0, (3, 5, 7)>, <3, (0, 5, 9)>, <4, (0, 6, 8)>, <5, (0, 3, 7)>, and <8, (4, 9, 0)>.
