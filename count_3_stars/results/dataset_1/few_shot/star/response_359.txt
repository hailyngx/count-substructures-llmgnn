Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 2

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph can be determined by looking at each node and its neighbors to identify if there is a 3-star centered at that node. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<3, (2, 4, 7)>
<5, (6, 7, 8)>
<6, (5, 7, 8)>
