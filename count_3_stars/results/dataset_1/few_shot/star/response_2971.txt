Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible combinations where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. The 3-stars in this graph are:

<1, (0, 2, 7)>
<3, (6, 9, 9)>
<6, (3, 8, 9)>
<7, (1, 8, 9)>
<9, (2, 4, 5)>

Therefore, there are a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
