Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (2, 9) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible 3-stars based on the given information.

Let's first list all unique 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<7, (0, 4, 8)>
<8, (3, 7, 9)>
<9, (2, 3, 4)>

Now, count the total number of 3-stars in the graph inside brackets:
[4]
