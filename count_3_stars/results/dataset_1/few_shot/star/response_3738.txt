Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 4
