Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 7

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars present. So let's go through the nodes one by one:

1. For Node 0:
   - Possible 3-stars with node 0 as the center:
     - <0, (3, 4, 7)>
     - <0, (3, 7, 8)>

2. For Node 1:
   - No 3-stars possible with node 1 as the center.

3. For Node 2:
   - No 3-stars possible with node 2 as the center.

4. For Node 3:
   - Possible 3-stars with node 3 as the center:
     - <3, (0, 7, 8)>

5. For Node 4:
   - No 3-stars possible with node 4 as the center.

6. For Node 5:
   - No 3-stars possible with node 5 as the center.

7. For Node 6:
   - No 3-stars possible with node 6 as the center.

8. For Node 7:
   - Possible 3-stars with node 7 as the center:
     - <7, (0, 4, 9)>

9. For Node 8:
   - No 3-stars possible with node 8 as the center.

10. For Node 9:
   - No 3-stars possible with node 9 as the center.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3]. 
The unique 3-stars are <0, (3, 4, 7)>, <0, (3, 7, 8)>, and <7, (0, 4, 9)>.
