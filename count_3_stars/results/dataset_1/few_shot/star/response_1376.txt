Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 2

Response:
Based on the given information, we need to find all the 3-stars in the graph. Let's begin by identifying the central nodes and their adjacent nodes:

- Node 0 has 2 adjacent nodes: 5, 6
- Node 1 has 5 adjacent nodes: 4, 5, 6, 8, 9
- Node 2 has 3 adjacent nodes: 6, 8, 9
- Node 3 has 2 adjacent nodes: 6, 7
- Node 4 has 1 adjacent node: 1
- Node 5 has 2 adjacent nodes: 0, 1
- Node 6 has 5 adjacent nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 8
- Node 7 has 1 adjacent node: 3
- Node 8 has 3 adjacent nodes: 1, 2, 6
- Node 9 has 2 adjacent nodes: 1, 2

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (5, 6)> 
<1, (4, 5, 6)>
<1, (5, 6, 8)>
<1, (6, 8, 9)>
<2, (6, 8, 9)>
<3, (6, 7, -)>
<8, (1, 2, 6)> 

Count the total number of 3-stars: [6]
