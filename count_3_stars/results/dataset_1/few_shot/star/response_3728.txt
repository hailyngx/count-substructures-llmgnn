Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first identify all the 3-stars by looking for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list the 3-stars found:

<0, (4, 7, 9)>
<1, (3, 5, 6)>
<2, (3, 4, 6)>
<3, (1, 2, 4)>
<4, (0, 2, 6)>
<5, (1, 3, 7)>
<6, (1, 2, 4)>
<7, (0, 5, 8)>
<8, (6, 7)>
<9, (0, 4, 6)>

[The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 10.]
