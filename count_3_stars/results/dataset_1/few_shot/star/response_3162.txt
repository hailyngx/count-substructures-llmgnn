Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, 7, and node 8

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star configuration in the graph.

Let's first identify the central node and its adjacent nodes for each node:
- Node 0: (6, 7, 9)
- Node 1: (3, 6, 8)
- Node 2: (7)
- Node 3: (1, 6, 7)
- Node 4: (5, 6, 8)
- Node 5: (4, 9)
- Node 6: (0, 1, 3, 4, 7, 9)
- Node 7: (0, 2, 3, 6, 9)
- Node 8: (1, 4, 9)
- Node 9: (0, 5, 6, 7, 8)

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars present in the graph:
- Since a 3-star has a central node connected to exactly 3 other nodes, we can see the following 3-stars in the graph:
    - <0, (6, 7, 9)>
    - <1, (3, 6, 8)>
    - <4, (5, 6, 8)>
    - <5, (4, 9)>
- Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
