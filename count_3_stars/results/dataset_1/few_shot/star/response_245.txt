Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node:

Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 5, and node 8

Response:
Let's go step by step to find the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

Step 1: Identify the central nodes of potential 3-stars.
- From the adjacency list, the potential central nodes for 3-stars are nodes: 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 9.

Step 2: For each potential central node, find how many 3-stars can be formed.
- For node 1, the 3-stars are: 
    - <1, (3, 5, 6)>
    - <1, (3, 6, 7)>
- For node 2, the 3-stars are:
    - <2, (3, 5, 6)>
    - <2, (3, 6, 7)>
    - <2, (5, 6, 7)>
- For node 5, the 3-star is: 
    - <5, (1, 2, 4)>
- For node 6, the 3-star is:
    - <6, (1, 2, 4)>
- For node 7, the 3-star is: 
    - <7, (1, 2, 4)>
- For node 9, no 3-stars can be formed.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of 3-stars.
- Total number of 3-stars = 2 (from node 1) + 3 (from node 2) + 1 (from node 5) + 1 (from node 6) + 1 (from node 7) = 8

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
Unique 3-stars found: <1, (3, 5, 6)>, <1, (3, 6, 7)>, <2, (3, 5, 6)>, <2, (3, 6, 7)>, <2, (5, 6, 7)>, <5, (1, 2, 4)>, <6, (1, 2, 4)>, <7, (1, 2, 4)>
