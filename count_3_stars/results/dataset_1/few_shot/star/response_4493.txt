Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

From the adjacency list provided, we can identify the possible 3-stars:
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3 (forming the 3-star <4, (1, 2, 3)>).
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 5 (forming the 3-star <7, (2, 4, 5)>).
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 7 (forming the 3-star <9, (1, 4, 7)>).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].

<4, (1, 2, 3)>
<7, (2, 4, 5)>
<9, (1, 4, 7)>
