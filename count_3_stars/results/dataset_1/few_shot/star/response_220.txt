Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify 3-stars by finding nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

Looking at the adjacency list, we can see that the nodes with the following connections form 3-stars:
- Node 0: connected to nodes 1, 4, 5
- Node 1: connected to nodes 0, 2, 5
- Node 2: connected to nodes 1, 4, 5
- Node 4: connected to nodes 0, 2, 7
- Node 5: connected to nodes 0, 1, 7

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in this graph are:
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<1, (0, 2, 5)>
<2, (1, 4, 5)>
<4, (0, 2, 7)>
<5, (0, 1, 7)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
