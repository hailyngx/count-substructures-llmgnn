Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 6

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
<0, (2, 6, 9)>
<1, (3, 5, 7)>
<2, (0, 4, 8)>
<3, (1, 4, 6)>
<4, (2, 5, 7)>
<5, (1, 4, 7)>
<6, (0, 3, 8)>
<7, (1, 4, 5)>
<8, (2, 5, 6)>
<9, (0, 6)>

Count the number of 3-stars: [9]
