Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 6

Response:
Step 1: Identify the 3-stars in the given graph.
Let's go through each node to find the 3-stars:
Node 0: <0, (4, 5, 6)>
Node 1: <1, (5, 6, 9)>
Node 2: No 3-star as it needs to be the center.
Node 3: No connections.
Node 4: <4, (0, 2, 6)>
Node 5: <5, (0, 1, 6)>
Node 6: <6, (0, 1, 4)>
Node 7: No 3-star as it needs to be the center.
Node 8: No connections.
Node 9: No 3-star as it needs to be the center.

Step 2: Count the number of unique 3-stars.
Number of unique 3-stars: [3] 

Therefore, the final answer is [3].
The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (4, 5, 6)>, <4, (0, 2, 6)>, <5, (0, 1, 6)>
