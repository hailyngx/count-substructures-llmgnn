Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 6

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0 <0, (1, 8, 9)>
2. Node 2 <2, (1, 8, 9)>
3. Node 3 <3, (0, 6, 9)>
4. Node 6 <6, (2, 7, 9)>
5. Node 9 <9, (0, 3, 6)>

Therefore, there are a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
