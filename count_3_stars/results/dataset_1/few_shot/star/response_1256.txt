Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 2

Response:
Given graph has 3-stars are: <0, (2, 7, 9)>, <1, (5, 6, 7)>, <2, (0, 3, 9)>, and <3, (2, 7, 8)>. 
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
