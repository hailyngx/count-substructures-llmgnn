Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 7

Response:
Since a 3-star graph consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can identify the 3-stars by looking for nodes that have exactly three neighbors in the given graph.

Looking at the adjacency list, we can identify the nodes that have exactly three neighbors as follows:
- Node 3 has neighbors 0, 8, and 9
- Node 4 has neighbors 1, 5, and 9
- Node 5 has neighbors 2, 4, and 9
- Node 7 has neighbors 0, 8, and 9
- Node 8 has neighbors 3, 6, and 7
- Node 9 has neighbors 3, 4, 5, and 7

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars in the given graph:

By counting the unique combinations, we find there are 6 unique 3-stars in the graph:

[6] 
<3, (0, 8, 9)>
<4, (1, 5, 9)>
<5, (2, 4, 9)>
<7, (0, 8, 9)>
<8, (3, 6, 7)>
<9, (3, 4, 5)>
