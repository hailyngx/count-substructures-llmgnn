Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: Identify the nodes with exactly 3 neighbors since a 3-star graph involves the center node being connected to exactly 3 other nodes.
         - Nodes 1, 5, 8, and 9 have exactly 3 neighbors.

Step 2: For each of these nodes, list the 3-stars they are part of.
         - For node 1: There are no 3-star configurations.
         - For node 5: There are no 3-star configurations.
         - For node 8: There are no 3-star configurations.
         - For node 9: There are no 3-star configurations.

Step 3: Count the total number of 3-stars in the graph.
         - Total number of 3-stars: [0]

Therefore, the final answer is [0].
