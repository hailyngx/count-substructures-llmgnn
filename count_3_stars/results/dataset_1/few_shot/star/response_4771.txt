Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 7
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a 3-star pattern with it at the center. 

Based on the given information, we can identify the following 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (1, 4, 8)>
<1, (0, 4, 7)>
<4, (0, 1, 7)>
<6, (3, 7, 9)>
<7, (1, 4, 6)>
<9, (2, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6]. 
<List of unique 3-stars: <0, (1, 4, 8)>, <1, (0, 4, 7)>, <4, (0, 1, 7)>, <6, (3, 7, 9)>, <7, (1, 4, 6)>, <9, (2, 6, 8)>]
