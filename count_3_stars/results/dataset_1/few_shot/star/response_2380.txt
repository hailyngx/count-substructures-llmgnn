Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
The unique 3-stars are: <0, (1, 5, 8)>, <0, (5, 2, 6)>, <1, (0, 3, 7)>, <1, (3, 6, 2)>, <3, (1, 6, 7)>, <6, (2, 3, 9)>.
