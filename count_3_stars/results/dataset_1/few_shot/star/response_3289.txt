Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we look for each node that has exactly three neighbors and then check if it forms a 3-star with those neighbors.

From the adjacency list provided, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (1, 7, 8)>
<1, (0, 2, 5)>
<2, (1, 6, 7)>
<7, (0, 1, 2)>
<8, (0, 4, 9)>

Now, we count the number of unique 3-stars found: [5].
