Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern. 
Let's first identify the 3-stars present in the graph:

<2, (3, 4, 7)> 
<2, (3, 7, 9)> 

Now we count the total number of unique 3-stars: 
[2]
