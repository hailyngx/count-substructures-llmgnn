Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 6
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 3
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 3

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the graph, which are connected to exactly three other nodes. 
From the adjacency list, we can see that the central nodes are nodes 3, 4, 5, and 6.

Now, let's find all the unique 3-stars in the graph:
- For node 3: (3, 4, 5), (3, 4, 6), (3, 5, 4), (3, 5, 6), (3, 6, 4), (3, 6, 5)  
- For node 4: (4, 3, 5), (4, 3, 8), (4, 3, 9), (4, 5, 3), (4, 5, 8), (4, 8, 3)  
- For node 5: (5, 3, 4)  
- For node 6: (6, 3, 4)  

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
The unique 3-stars are <3, (4, 5, 6)>, <4, (3, 5, 8)>, <5, (3, 4)>, and <6, (3, 4)>.
