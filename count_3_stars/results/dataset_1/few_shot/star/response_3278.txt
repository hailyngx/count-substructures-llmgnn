Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 6

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star structures in the graph:

1. Node 0: (0, 1, 2), (0, 1, 7)
2. Node 1: (1, 0, 7), (1, 4, 6)
3. Node 2: (2, 0, 8), (2, 0, 9)
4. Node 3: (3, 4, 6), (3, 4, 9)
5. Node 4: (4, 1, 0), (4, 1, 8)
6. Node 6: (6, 1, 3), (6, 1, 8)
7. Node 7: (7, 0, 1), (7, 0, 5)
8. Node 8: (8, 2, 4), (8, 2, 6)
9. Node 9: (9, 2, 3), (9, 2, 4)

Count of 3-star structures: [9]
Unique 3-stars: <0, (1, 2, 7)>, <1, (0, 4, 6)>, <2, (0, 8, 9)>, <3, (4, 6, 9)>, <4, (1, 0, 8)>, <6, (1, 3, 8)>, <7, (0, 1, 5)>, <8, (2, 4, 6)>, <9, (2, 3, 4)>
