Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 3
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 8

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 24 edges, we need to count the number of 3-star subgraphs. 

Let's represent the graph in terms of edges from center nodes to leaf nodes:
- Node 0 forms 3-star with nodes 2, 3, 7
- Node 1 forms 3-star with nodes 3, 5, 7
- Node 2 forms 3-star with nodes 0, 3, 5
- Node 3 forms 3-star with nodes 0, 1, 2

Therefore, the total number of 3-star subgraphs in this graph is 4.

[4]

Unique 3-stars: 
<0, (2, 3, 7)>
<1, (3, 5, 7)>
<2, (0, 3, 5)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
