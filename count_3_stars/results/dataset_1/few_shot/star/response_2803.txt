Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node forms a 3-star with three other nodes.

Let's start by identifying the 3-stars in the graph:
1. Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 5, and 9. <0, (2, 5, 9)>
2. Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 6, and 9. <2, (0, 6, 9)>
3. Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 4, and 7. <3, (1, 4, 7)>
4. Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 3, and 8. <4, (0, 3, 8)>
5. Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 7, and 9. <6, (2, 7, 9)>
6. Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 5, and 6. <8, (4, 5, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
