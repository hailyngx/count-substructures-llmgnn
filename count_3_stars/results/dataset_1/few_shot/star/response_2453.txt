Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars. 

From the given graph, the 3-stars can be formed by choosing a node as the center and its three adjacent nodes as the leaves. 

Based on the adjacency list provided, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<2, (0, 1, 4)>
<3, (0, 1, 5)>
<5, (1, 3, 7)>
<6, (1, 2, 0)>
<7, (1, 5, 9)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
