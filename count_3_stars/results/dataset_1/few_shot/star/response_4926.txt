Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 46 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible occurrences of 3-stars. As mentioned earlier, a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Given the adjacency list and the edges provided, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. <0, (1, 3, 5)>
2. <0, (1, 3, 9)>
3. <0, (2, 4, 5)>
4. <0, (3, 5, 9)>
5. <1, (0, 3, 9)>
6. <1, (3, 4, 5)>
7. <2, (4, 6, 8)>
8. <2, (5, 6, 8)>
9. <3, (0, 1, 5)>
10. <3, (0, 5, 7)>
11. <4, (1, 2, 5)>
12. <5, (0, 3, 9)>
13. <5, (2, 6, 8)>
14. <5, (6, 8, 9)>
15. <6, (2, 5, 8)>
16. <6, (5, 7, 8)>
17. <6, (5, 8, 9)>
18. <7, (3, 5, 6)>
19. <8, (2, 6, 9)>
20. <8, (5, 6, 9)>
21. <9, (0, 1, 5)>
22. <9, (0, 5, 8)>
23. <9, (2, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [23].
