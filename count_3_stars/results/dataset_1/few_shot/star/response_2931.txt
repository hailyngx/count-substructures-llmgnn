Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 8

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, and 9 which forms 4 different 3-stars. These are <8, (0, 2, 4)>, <8, (0, 2, 9)>, <8, (0, 4, 9)>, and <8, (2, 4, 9)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
These 3-stars are <8, (0, 2, 4)>, <8, (0, 2, 9)>, <8, (0, 4, 9)>, and <8, (2, 4, 9)>.
