Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 7
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 3

Response:
Here is the step-by-step solution to count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Identify nodes with exactly 3 neighbors. These nodes can potentially be the center of a 3-star.
   - Nodes 2, 6, and 7 have exactly 3 neighbors.

2. For each of these candidate center nodes, check if their neighbors are connected to each other.
   - Node 2: Nodes 4, 7, 8 are neighbors, but they are not directly connected to each other.
   - Node 6: Node 8 is its only neighbor, so no 3-stars centered at node 6.
   - Node 7: Nodes 2, 4, 8 are neighbors. Nodes 2 and 4 are connected to each other through node 7, forming a 3-star <7, (2, 4, 8)> centered at node 7.

3. Calculate the total number of 3-stars found.
   - Total number of 3-stars: 1

Therefore, the final answer is [1].
Unique 3-star found: <7, (2, 4, 8)>
