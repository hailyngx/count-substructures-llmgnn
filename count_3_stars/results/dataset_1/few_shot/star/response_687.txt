Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 0) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 0
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 8

Response:
Let's find the 3-star structures in the given graph:

From the adjacency list and edge list, the unique 3-stars are as follows:
<0, (5, 8, 9)>
<0, (6, 8, 9)>
<9, (0, 4, 8)>
<8, (0, 4, 9)>

There are [4] 3-stars in total.
