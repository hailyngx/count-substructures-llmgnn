Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and node 8

Response:
We will look for 3-stars in the given graph. Counting the number of 3-stars involves finding a central node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (1, 3, 9)>
<1, (0, 3, 9)>
<3, (0, 1, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
