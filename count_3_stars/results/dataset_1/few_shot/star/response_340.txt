Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 7
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 6
