Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 3

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 4, and 5: <0, (3, 4, 5)>
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 6, and 9: <0, (5, 6, 9)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 7, and 8: <5, (6, 7, 8)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 7, and 8: <6, (5, 7, 8)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
