Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find sets of nodes that form 3-stars.

Observations:
- For a 3-star to exist, a node must have 3 edges connected to it.
- These 3 edges must not already be connected to each other (otherwise, they would form a cycle or another structure).
- We must consider each potential center node that satisfies the above conditions.

Let's go through the nodes to identify the 3-stars:

Potential 3-stars around each node:
- Node 0: {(1, 2, 3), (1, 3, 9), (2, 1, 9)}
- Node 1: {(0, 7, 9)}
- Node 2: No 3-stars
- Node 3: No 3-stars
- Node 4: {(7, 5, 9)}
- Node 5: No 3-stars
- Node 6: No 3-stars
- Node 7: No 3-stars
- Node 8: No 3-stars
- Node 9: No 3-stars

Final Answer: [4]
Unique 3-stars: 
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<0, (1, 3, 9)>
<0, (2, 1, 9)>
<4, (7, 5, 9)>
