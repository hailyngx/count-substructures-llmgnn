Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 4

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes through edges.

Based on the adjacency list provided, the 3-star configurations can be identified as follows:

<0, (7, 8, 4)>
<3, (8, 9, 4)>
<4, (1, 2, 7)>
<4, (1, 2, 8)>
<4, (1, 2, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5]. 

<0, (7, 8, 4)>, <3, (8, 9, 4)>, <4, (1, 2, 7)>, <4, (1, 2, 8)>, <4, (1, 2, 9)>
