Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 8

Response:
Let's first identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
- 3-star with center node 8: (8, 0, 1, 2), (8, 0, 1, 3), (8, 0, 1, 4), (8, 0, 1, 6)
- 3-star with center node 2: (2, 3, 4, 8)
- 3-star with center node 5: (5, 0, 1, 6)

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph: [7]

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found are:
<8, (0, 1, 2)>, <8, (0, 1, 3)>, <8, (0, 1, 4)>, <8, (0, 1, 6)>, <2, (3, 4, 8)>, <5, (0, 1, 6)>
