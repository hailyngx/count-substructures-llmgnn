Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Looking at the adjacency list provided, we can see that the following nodes have exactly three connections:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 6, 7, and 8
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 5 and 8
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 8
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 8
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1 and 4
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0 and 7
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 6, and 8

Therefore, we have identified the unique 3-stars in the given graph:
<0, (6, 7, 8)>
<1, (5, 8)>
<2, (3, 4, 8)>
<4, (2, 5, 8)>
<5, (1, 4)>
<6, (0, 7)>
<7, (0, 6, 8)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we find that there are 7 such structures in the graph, so the final answer is [7].
