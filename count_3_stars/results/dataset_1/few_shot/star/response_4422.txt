Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 7

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Node 0:
   - Node 0 is connected to nodes 1 and 8, making a 3-star with node 0 as the center and nodes 1 and 8 as the leaves. (<0, (1, 8)>)

2. Node 1:
   - Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 5, and 9, making three 3-stars:
     - <1, (0, 8, 5)>
     - <1, (0, 5, 9)>
     - <1, (0, 8, 9)>

3. Node 8:
   - Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 5, and 7, making one 3-star: 
     - <8, (0, 5, 7)>

4. Node 9:
   - Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 6, and 7, making four 3-stars:
     - <9, (1, 6, 7)>
     - <9, (1, 3, 7)>
     - <9, (1, 6, 3)>
     - <9, (6, 7, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
