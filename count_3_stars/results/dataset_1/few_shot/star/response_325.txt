Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 3

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify all unique 3-stars formed by a central node and three leaves.

Given the adjacency list and the edges provided, the 3-stars in this graph can be represented as:
<0, (4, 5, 7)>
<3, (1, 5, 6)>
<3, (1, 8, 9)>
<3, (5, 6, 9)>
<4, (0, 7, 8)>
<7, (0, 2, 4)>
<7, (2, 4, 8)>
<8, (2, 4, 7)>
