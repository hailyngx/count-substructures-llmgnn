Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a 3-star. 

There are 2 unique 3-stars in this graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<2, (4, 5, 6)>
<8, (3, 5, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
