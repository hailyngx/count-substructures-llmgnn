Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 2) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 0

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are <0, (3, 9, 3)>, <1, (6, 7, 1)>, <2, (7, 8, 2)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
