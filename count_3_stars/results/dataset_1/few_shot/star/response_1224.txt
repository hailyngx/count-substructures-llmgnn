Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 8

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are:

<1, (3, 5, 9)>
<3, (1, 7, 8)>
<7, (3, 4, 9)>
<9, (5, 7, 8)>

There are [4] unique 3-stars in the graph.
