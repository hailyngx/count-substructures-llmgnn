Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes (forming a 3-star pattern).

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in this graph:

<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<0, (2, 5, 6)>
<0, (2, 6, 8)>
<0, (4, 6, 9)>
<2, (0, 5, 6)>
<2, (0, 6, 8)>
<3, (1, 8, 9)>
<4, (0, 6, 9)>
<4, (6, 9, 0)>
<8, (0, 2, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
