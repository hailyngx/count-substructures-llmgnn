Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern with the selected node as the center.

Given the adjacency list for each node, we can identify the 3-stars:

<2, (3, 8, 9)>
<3, (1, 2, 9)>
<4, (2, 7, 8)>
<8, (2, 3, 4)>
<9, (2, 3, 4)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
