Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 8

Response:
The total number of 3-star subgraphs in this graph can be found by counting the number of 3-stars around each node and summing them up.

Let's calculate it:

For Node 0:
- (0, 2, 6) forms a 3-star. 

For Node 1:
- (1, 2, 5) forms a 3-star.
- (1, 5, 7) forms a 3-star.

For Node 2:
- (2, 0, 1) forms a 3-star.
- (2, 1, 5) forms a 3-star.
- (2, 3, 9) forms a 3-star.

For Node 3:
- No 3-star as it has only one neighbor.

For Node 4:
- No 3-star as it has only one neighbor.

For Node 5:
- (5, 1, 2) forms a 3-star.
- (5, 7, 9) forms a 3-star.

For Node 6:
- No 3-star as it has only one neighbor.

For Node 7:
- (7, 1, 5) forms a 3-star.
- (7, 4, 5) forms a 3-star.

For Node 8:
- No 3-star as it has only one neighbor.

For Node 9:
- (9, 2, 5) forms a 3-star.
- (9, 5, 8) forms a 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is: 
[9]

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (2, 6, 0)>
<1, (2, 1, 5)>
<1, (5, 7, 1)>
<2, (0, 1, 2)>
<2, (1, 5, 2)>
<2, (3, 9, 2)>
<5, (1, 2, 5)>
<5, (7, 9, 5)>
<7, (1, 5, 7)>
<7, (4, 5, 7)>
