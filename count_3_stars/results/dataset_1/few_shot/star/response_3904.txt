Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will identify each 3-star pattern by looking for nodes that are connected in the form of a central node and three leaves. 

We will consider each node as a potential central node and check if it is connected to exactly three other nodes. Then, we will identify the leaves connected to the central node to form a 3-star.

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (2, 3, 6)>
<0, (2, 6, 8)>
<0, (3, 4, 6)>
<0, (4, 6, 8)>
<5, (1, 6, 9)>
<5, (6, 9, 1)>
<5, (1, 9, 5)>
<5, (9, 5, 1)>
<8, (0, 4, 9)>
<8, (4, 9, 0)>
<8, (0, 9, 4)>
<8, (9, 4, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
