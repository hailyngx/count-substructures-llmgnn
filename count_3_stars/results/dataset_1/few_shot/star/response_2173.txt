Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5

Response:
To determine the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph, we need to find all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes (i.e., it forms a 3-star). 

Based on the adjacency list and the definition of a 3-star graph, we can identify the following 3-star structures:
<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<1, (7, 8, 9)>
<2, (4, 5, 6)>
<3, (0, 1, 5)>
<5, (0, 2, 9)>
<8, (0, 1, 7)>
<9, (1, 2, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [7].
The unique 3-stars are: <0, (2, 4, 6)>, <1, (7, 8, 9)>, <2, (4, 5, 6)>, <3, (0, 1, 5)>, <5, (0, 2, 9)>, <8, (0, 1, 7)>, and <9, (1, 2, 5)>.
