Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 6

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:
1. Node 0: No 3-star as it is connected to only 2 nodes.

2. Node 1: No 3-star as it is not connected to exactly 3 nodes.

3. Node 2: No 3-star as it is connected to only 1 node.

4. Node 3: 
    a. <3, (0, 6, 9)>
   
5. Node 4: No 3-star as it is not connected to exactly 3 nodes.

6. Node 5: No 3-star as it is not connected to exactly 3 nodes.

7. Node 6: 
    a. <6, (0, 3, 9)>
    b. <6, (1, 3, 9)>
    c. <6, (3, 5, 9)>

8. Node 7: No 3-star as it is not connected to exactly 3 nodes.

9. Node 8: No 3-star as it is connected to only 2 nodes.

10. Node 9: No 3-star as it is not connected to exactly 3 nodes.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3]. Inside brackets [] is the final answer.
