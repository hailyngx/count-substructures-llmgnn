Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 3

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph step by step.

<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<1, (2, 3, 8)>
<3, (0, 1, 4)>
<3, (0, 5, 7)>
<3, (1, 4, 9)>
<5, (0, 3, 7)>
<6, (0, 4, 8)>
<7, (3, 5, 8)>
<8, (1, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
