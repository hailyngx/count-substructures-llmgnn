Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible instances where a node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes forming a 3-star pattern.

Looking at the adjacency list for each node, we can determine the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 0: <0, (3, 4, 5)>, <0, (3, 5, 7)>
2. Node 2: <2, (3, 6, 7)>, <2, (3, 6, 8)>
3. Node 3: <3, (0, 2, 7)>, <3, (0, 6, 7)>
4. Node 4: <4, (0, 8, 6)>
5. Node 6: <6, (2, 8, 4)>
6. Node 7: <7, (0, 2, 3)>
7. Node 8: <8, (4, 6, 2)>

Therefore, there are 7 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
So, the final answer is [7].
