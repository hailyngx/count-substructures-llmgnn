Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a 3-star pattern.

Looking at the adjacency list provided, we can identify the 3-stars:

<2, (4, 5, 9)>
<4, (0, 3, 7)>
<9, (2, 4, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
