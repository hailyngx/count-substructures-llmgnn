Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 6

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we can see that the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes are nodes 3, 4, 6, and 9. These nodes can act as the center of a 3-star. 

Next, let's list all the 3-stars in the graph:
<3, (4, 6, 9)>
<4, (3, 6, 7)>
<6, (3, 4, 9)>
<9, (1, 3, 6)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we get a total of [4].
