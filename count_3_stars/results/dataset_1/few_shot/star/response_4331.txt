Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 8

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (4, 6, 8)>
<4, (0, 1, 2)>
<6, (0, 2, 9)>
<9, (6, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
