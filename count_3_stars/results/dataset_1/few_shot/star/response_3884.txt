Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that has exactly three neighbors connected to it. 

From the adjacency list, we see that the nodes with exactly three neighbors are nodes 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (1, 3, 7)>
<1, (0, 3, 8)>
<3, (0, 1, 7)>
<5, (2, 6, 8)>
<7, (0, 3, 9)>
<9, (0, 3, 5)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars: [6]
