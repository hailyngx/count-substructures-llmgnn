Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 2, and 3: <0, (1, 2, 3)>
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 6, and 8: <0, (4, 6, 8)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 6, and 7: <1, (0, 6, 7)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 5, and 8: <2, (0, 5, 8)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 5, and 6: <3, (0, 5, 6)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 6, and 7: <4, (0, 6, 7)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 3, and 8: <5, (2, 3, 8)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, and 4: <6, (1, 3, 4)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 4, and 6: <7, (1, 4, 6)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 4, and 6: <8, (0, 4, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
