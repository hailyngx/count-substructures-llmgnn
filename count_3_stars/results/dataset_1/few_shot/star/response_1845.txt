Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and node 6

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
1. Node 0: <0, (2, 3, 6)>
2. Node 1: <1, (5, 6, 7)>
3. Node 2: <2, (0, 4, 8)>
4. Node 3: <3, (0, 5, 7)>
5. Node 4: <4, (2, 8, 9)>
6. Node 5: <5, (1, 3, 7)>
7. Node 6: <6, (0, 1, 9)>
8. Node 7: <7, (1, 3, 5)>
9. Node 8: <8, (0, 2, 4)>
10. Node 9: <9, (0, 1, 2)>

Therefore, there are a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
