Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, 7, and node 8

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes in the graph:
Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Next, let's identify the 3-star structures present in the graph:

<0, (2, 7, 1)>
<1, (2, 0, 9)>
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<3, (1, 9, 7)>
<5, (8, 9, 1)>
<7, (0, 3, 9)>
<8, (1, 5, 9)>
<9, (1, 8, 3)>

Count the number of 3-stars: [8]
