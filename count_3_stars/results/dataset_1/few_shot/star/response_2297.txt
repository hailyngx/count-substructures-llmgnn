Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 4, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will be the centers of the 3-stars. Then, we will identify the three connected nodes for each center to form the 3-stars.

Here are the steps to find the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Identify nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
   - Node 2 and Node 4 are connected to exactly three other nodes each.

2. Form 3-stars around each identified center:
   - For Node 2: (2, 0, 1, 9) and (2, 4, 6, 7)
   - For Node 4: (4, 0, 2, 5) and (4, 6, 9)

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4]. 
Here are the unique 3-stars:
   - <2, (0, 1, 9)>
   - <2, (4, 6, 7)>
   - <4, (0, 2, 5)>
   - <4, (6, 9)>
