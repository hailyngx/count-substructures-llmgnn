Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 0) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 6

Response:
The list of unique 3-stars in the given graph is as follows:
<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<0, (5, 4, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
