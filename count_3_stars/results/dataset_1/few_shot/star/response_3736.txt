Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 7

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 2, and 4
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 4, and 8
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 4, and 9
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 8, and 9

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
Unique 3-stars: <0, (1, 2, 4)>, <6, (3, 4, 8)>, <6, (0, 4, 9)>, <7, (1, 8, 9)>
