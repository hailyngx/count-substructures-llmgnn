Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 8

Response:
Let's go step by step to count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

Step 1: Identify the center nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.
Based on the adjacency list, the potential center nodes are: 1, 4, 5, 6.

Step 2: For each potential center node, check if it forms a 3-star.
- For node 1: (1, 5, 6), (1, 5, 9), (1, 6, 9)
- For node 4: (4, 2, 7), (4, 2, 8), (4, 7, 8)
- For node 5: (5, 1, 6), (5, 1, 7), (5, 6, 7)
- For node 6: (6, 1, 5), (6, 1, 7), (6, 2, 5)

Step 3: Calculate the number of unique 3-stars found.
<1, (5, 6, 9)>, <4, (2, 7, 8)>, <5, (1, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3]. 
The unique 3-stars found are <1, (5, 6, 9)>, <4, (2, 7, 8)>, <5, (1, 6, 7)>.
