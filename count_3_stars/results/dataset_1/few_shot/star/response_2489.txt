Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern and then determine how many times it occurs. 

Let's first identify the unique 3-star patterns and then count them:

<0, (1, 3, 7)>
<2, (1, 7, 9)>
<3, (0, 4, 9)>
<5, (0, 4, 9)>
<8, (3, 6, 7)>

After identifying the unique 3-stars, we count them:
