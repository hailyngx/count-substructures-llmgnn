Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 8
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 5

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

From the adjacency list, we can see that the nodes are connected as follows:
- Node 0: (4, 5, 7)
- Node 1: (3, 4, 8)
- Node 3: (1, 7, 9)
- Node 4: (0, 1, 5, 8, 9)
- Node 5: (0, 4, 7, 8, 9)
- Node 7: (0, 3, 5, 8)
- Node 8: (1, 4, 5, 6, 7)
- Node 9: (3, 4, 5)

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:
- The 3-stars are centered at nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9.
- Count the 3-stars at each center:
  - Center at Node 0: (4, 5, 7)
  - Center at Node 1: (3, 4, 8)
  - Center at Node 3: (1, 7, 9)
  - Center at Node 4: (0, 1, 5) and (0, 8, 9)
  - Center at Node 5: (0, 4, 7) and (0, 8, 9)
  - Center at Node 7: (0, 3, 5) and (1, 5, 8)
  - Center at Node 8: (1, 4, 5) and (1, 7, 9)
  - Center at Node 9: (3, 4, 5)
  
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [12].
The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (4, 5, 7)>
- <1, (3, 4, 8)>
- <3, (1, 7, 9)>
- <4, (0, 1, 5)>
- <4, (0, 8, 9)>
- <5, (0, 4, 7)>
- <5, (0, 8, 9)>
- <7, (0, 3, 5)>
- <7, (1, 5, 8)>
- <8, (1, 4, 5)>
- <8, (1, 7, 9)>
- <9, (3, 4, 5)>
