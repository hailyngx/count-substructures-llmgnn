Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 2

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will be the center of the 3-stars. Let's identify the 3-stars step by step:

1. Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, 7, and node 9. Since it is connected to exactly three nodes (0, 1, and 5), it forms a 3-star: <2, (0, 1, 5)>.

2. Node 1 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 9. Since it is also connected to exactly three nodes (2, 7, and 9), it forms another 3-star: <1, (2, 7, 9)>.

3. Node 4 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 8. Since it is connected to exactly three nodes (3, 6, and 8), it forms another 3-star: <4, (3, 6, 8)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
