Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Based on the given information, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph. 

The 3-star patterns are as follows:
<2, (1, 4, 7)>
<3, (2, 4, 6)>
<4, (2, 3, 8)>
<7, (2, 5, 8)>
<8, (3, 4, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
