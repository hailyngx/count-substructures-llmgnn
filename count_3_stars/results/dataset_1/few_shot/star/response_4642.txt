Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we follow these steps:

1. Identify the nodes which have exactly 3 edges connected to them, as these nodes can be the center of a 3-star.

Based on the adjacency list provided, the candidates for center nodes are:
- Node 1 (connected to 3, 6, 7)
- Node 2 (connected to 3, 8, 9)
- Node 4 (connected to 3, 6, 9)
- Node 5 (connected to 3, 6, 7)

2. For each candidate center node, check if the nodes connected to it form a 3-star.

Let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<1, (3, 6, 7)>
<2, (3, 8, 9)>
<4, (3, 6, 9)>
<5, (3, 6, 7)>

Count the total number of 3-stars in the graph after listing them: [3].
