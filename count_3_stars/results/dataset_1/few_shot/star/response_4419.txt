Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 9
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can identify each 3-star by looking at each node and its neighbors. A 3-star consists of a node (center) and three neighbors connected only to the center. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (1, 2, 9)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<3, (1, 5, 9)>
<4, (1, 2, 5)>
<5, (1, 3, 4)>
<9, (0, 3, 5)>

Count of 3-stars: [6]
