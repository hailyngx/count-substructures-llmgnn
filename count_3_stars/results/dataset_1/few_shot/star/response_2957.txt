Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (6, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 3

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible 3-stars by finding all nodes that have exactly three neighbors connected to them.

Based on the adjacency list provided, the 3-stars in the graph are as follows:
<0, (2, 3, 6)>
<0, (2, 3, 8)>
<1, (2, 4, 8)>
<1, (2, 8, 9)>
<3, (0, 8, 9)>
<4, (1, 7, 8)>
<8, (0, 1, 3)>
<8, (0, 1, 4)>
<8, (1, 3, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
