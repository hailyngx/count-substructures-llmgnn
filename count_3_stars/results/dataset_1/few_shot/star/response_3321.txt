Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 4

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all unique 3-stars. 

Let's list all the unique 3-stars in this graph:
<1, (3, 6, 7)>
<2, (0, 4, 6)>
<2, (0, 6, 9)>
<6, (1, 7, 8)>
<7, (0, 1, 8)>
<8, (1, 3, 6)>
<8, (1, 6, 7)>

Counting the total number of unique 3-stars, we have a total of [7].
