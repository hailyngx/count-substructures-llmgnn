Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, creating a 3-star pattern.

Looking at the provided information, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<1, (0, 3, 0)>
<2, (4, 9, 0)>
<4, (0, 2, 5)>
<5, (4, 8, 9)>
<6, (0, 7, 0)>
<7, (6, 8, 9)>
<8, (4, 5, 7)>
<9, (2, 4, 5)>

Counting the unique 3-stars found above, we get a total of [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
