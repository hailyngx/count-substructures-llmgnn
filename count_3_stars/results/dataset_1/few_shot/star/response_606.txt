Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 2

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the unique combinations of a central node and its three connected nodes. Let's find all possible 3-stars:

1. Node 0: (0, 3, 7), (0, 3, 8)
2. Node 1: (1, 4, 6)
3. Node 2: (2, 4, 5), (2, 4, 6), (2, 5, 6), (2, 5, 9)
4. Node 3: (3, 0, 5), (3, 2, 5), (3, 4, 5), (3, 2, 8)
5. Node 4: (4, 2, 6), (4, 6, 5), (4, 6, 7)
6. Node 5: (5, 2, 6), (5, 3, 6), (5, 4, 6)
7. Node 6: (6, 1, 4), (6, 1, 5), (6, 4, 5)
8. Node 7: (7, 0, 4)
9. Node 8: None
10. Node 9: None

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [17]. 

<0, (3, 7, 8)>, <1, (4, 6, 5)>, <2, (4, 5, 6)>, <3, (0, 5, 8)>, <4, (2, 6, 7)>, <5, (2, 3, 6)>, <6, (1, 4, 5)>, <7, (0, 4)>.
