Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 8

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 8, and 8 (duplicated).
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 6, and 8.
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 7, and 9.
- Node 3 does not form a 3-star as it only has 2 edges.
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 7, and 8.
- Node 5 does not form a 3-star as it only has 1 edge.
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 7, 8, and 9.
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 4, and 6.
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, 4, 6, and 9 (duplicated).
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 6, and 8 (duplicated).

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are: 
<0, (2, 8, 8)>, <1, (4, 6, 8)>, <2, (0, 7, 9)>, <4, (1, 7, 8)>, <6, (1, 7, 8, 9)>, <7, (2, 4, 6)> 

Count of 3-stars in the graph: [6]
