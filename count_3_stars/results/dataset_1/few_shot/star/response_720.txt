Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Since a 3-star graph has a center node connected to exactly three leaves, we can look for such structures in the graph.

The unique 3-stars in the given graph are as follows:
<1, (2, 7, 8)>
<3, (0, 6, 7)>
<6, (3, 4, 8)>
<8, (1, 5, 9)>

Count of 3-stars: [4]
