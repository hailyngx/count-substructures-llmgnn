Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible 3-stars. A 3-star consists of a central node (the center of the star) connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Looking at the given graph, we observe the following 3-stars:
1. <0, (1, 3, 4)>
2. <1, (0, 2, 5)>
3. <1, (0, 5, 6)>
4. <1, (0, 6, 7)>
5. <1, (2, 5, 7)>
6. <2, (1, 3, 7)>
7. <3, (0, 2, 6)>
8. <4, (0, 5, 6)>
9. <5, (1, 4, 8)>
10. <5, (1, 7, 8)>
11. <6, (1, 3, 7)>
12. <6, (1, 4, 8)>
13. <6, (1, 7, 8)>
14. <7, (0, 3, 5)>
15. <7, (1, 5, 6)>

So, there are a total of [15] 3-stars in the given graph.
