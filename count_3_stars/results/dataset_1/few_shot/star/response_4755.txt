Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 6

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the given graph:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 9: <0, (5, 9)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 4, 8: <1, (2, 4, 8)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 6, 8: <3, (4, 6, 8)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, 7: <4, (1, 3, 7)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 6, 9: <5, (0, 6, 9)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 5, 7: <6, (3, 5, 7)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 5, 6: <9, (0, 5, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
