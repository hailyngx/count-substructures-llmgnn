Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (5, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes in a star-like pattern. 

Here, we can see that nodes 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, and 8 are connected to exactly 3 other nodes. Let's list all the unique 3-stars:

<[1, (0, 4, 7)]>
<[1, (0, 8, 7)]>
<[1, (4, 7, 8)]>
<[1, (0, 7, 8)]>
<[1, (0, 8, 4)]>
<[1, (4, 8, 7)]>
<[3, (5, 8, 1)]>
<[3, (5, 8, 7)]>
<[4, (1, 0, 7)]>
<[4, (1, 0, 8)]>
<[4, (1, 7, 8)]>
<[4, (0, 7, 8)]>
<[6, (8, 1, 7)]>
<[6, (8, 1, 0)]>
<[6, (8, 7, 1)]>
<[7, (1, 0, 8)]>
<[7, (1, 8, 3)]>
<[7, (1, 8, 4)]>
<[7, (1, 8, 6)]>
<[8, (1, 0, 4)]>
<[8, (1, 6, 7)]>
<[8, (1, 7, 4)]>
<[8, (1, 0, 7)]>
<[8, (1, 4, 7)]>
<[8, (3, 5, 6)]>
<[8, (3, 5, 7)]>
<[8, (3, 5, 1)]>
<[8, (6, 7, 1)]>
<[8, (6, 7, 4)]>
<[8, (6, 7, 8)]>
<[8, (7, 1, 0)]>
<[8, (7, 1, 4)]>
<[8, (7, 1, 6)]>
<[8, (7, 1, 8)]>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [34].
