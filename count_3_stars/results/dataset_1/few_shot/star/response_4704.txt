Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 6

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- Node 0 forms 3-stars with the following sets of nodes: <0, (1, 5, 8)>
- Node 1 forms 3-stars with the following sets of nodes: <1, (0, 5, 7)>, <1, (4, 5, 7)>
- Node 5 forms 3-stars with the following sets of nodes: <5, (0, 1, 7)>, <5, (4, 7, 8)>
- Node 4 forms 3-stars with the following sets of nodes: <4, (1, 7, 8)>, <4, (5, 7, 8)>
- Node 7 forms 3-stars with the following sets of nodes: <7, (1, 5, 6)>, <7, (4, 5, 6)>
- Node 8 forms 3-stars with the following sets of nodes: <8, (0, 5, 6)>, <8, (4, 5, 6)>
- Node 6 forms 3-stars with the following sets of nodes: <6, (7, 8, 9)>

There are a total of [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
