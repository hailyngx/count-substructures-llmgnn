Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's proceed step-by-step:

1. Identify the central nodes:
- Node 0 is connected to 2 nodes: 4, 8
- Node 1 is connected to 3 nodes: 3, 4, 9
- Node 2 is connected to 3 nodes: 5, 6, 9
- Node 3 is connected to 2 nodes: 1, 9
- Node 4 is connected to 4 nodes: 0, 1, 5, 9
- Node 5 is connected to 4 nodes: 2, 4, 6, 7
- Node 6 is connected to 3 nodes: 2, 5, 7
- Node 7 is connected to 3 nodes: 5, 6, 8
- Node 8 is connected to 2 nodes: 0, 7
- Node 9 is connected to 4 nodes: 1, 2, 3, 4

2. Identify the 3-stars:
- For each central node, identify the connected nodes which form a 3-star with the central node.

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the given graph:
<4, (0, 1, 5)>
<5, (2, 4, 6)>
<6, (2, 5, 7)>
<7, (5, 6, 8)>
<9, (1, 2, 4)>

Count of 3-stars: [5]
