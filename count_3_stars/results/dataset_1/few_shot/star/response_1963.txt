Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star.

Let's analyze the connections for each node:

- Node 1: Not part of any 3-star as it is only connected to one other node.
- Node 2: Forms a 3-star <2, (3, 4, 7)>.
- Node 3: Forms a 3-star <3, (2, 4, 6)>.
- Node 4: Forms a 3-star <4, (1, 2, 3)>.
- Node 5: Not part of any 3-star as it is only connected to two other nodes.
- Node 6: Forms a 3-star <6, (3, 4, 5)> and <6, (7, 4, 3)>.
- Node 7: Not part of any 3-star as it is only connected to two other nodes.
- Node 8: Not part of any 3-star as it is only connected to two other nodes.
- Node 9: Not part of any 3-star as it is not connected to any other nodes.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4]. 

Unique 3-stars: 
<2, (3, 4, 7)>
<3, (2, 4, 6)>
<4, (1, 2, 3)>
<6, (3, 4, 5)>
