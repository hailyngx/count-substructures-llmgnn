Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 4) (2, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 4

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph:

1. We can see that node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 7, forming a 3-star graph <3, (4, 5, 7)>.

2. Node 4 is connected to nodes 1 and 9, forming a 3-star graph <4, (1, 9)>.

3. Node 5 is not part of any 3-star graph.

4. Node 7 is not part of any 3-star graph.

5. Node 8 is not part of any 3-star graph.

6. Node 9 does not form a 3-star graph with its neighbors.

Therefore, the total number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [2].
The unique 3-star graphs are <3, (4, 5, 7)> and <4, (1, 9)>.
