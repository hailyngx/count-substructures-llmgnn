Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 3

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star structures in the given graph.

We observe that a 3-star structure requires a center node connected to exactly three other nodes. Based on this definition, we can identify the 3-star structures present in the graph:

1. <1, (5, 7, 9)>
2. <3, (0, 9, 1)>
3. <7, (1, 4, 6)>
4. <8, (5, 6, 7)>

Counting the number of 3-stars in the graph, we find that there are 4 unique 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
