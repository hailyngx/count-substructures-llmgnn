Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, and node 7

Response:
Given the graph, we need to find the number of 3-stars. 
Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

<1, (4, 8, 9)>
<4, (1, 5, 6)>
<5, (0, 4, 6)>
<6, (4, 5, 9)>
<8, (1, 4, 5)>
<9, (4, 6, 7)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we find that there are [6] 3-stars in the graph.
