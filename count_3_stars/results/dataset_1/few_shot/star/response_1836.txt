Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 6

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
1. Node 0 forms a 3-star: center node 0, leaves 3, 9
2. Node 4 forms a 3-star: center node 4, leaves 3, 5
3. Node 6 forms a 3-star: center node 6, leaves 1, 9

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
<0, (3, 9)>, <4, (3, 5)>, <6, (1, 9)>
