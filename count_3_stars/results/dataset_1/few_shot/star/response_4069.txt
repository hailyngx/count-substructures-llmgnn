Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star pattern. Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

<0, (6, 9)>
<1, (2, 4, 5)>
<2, (1, 3, 6)>
<4, (1, 3, 6)>
<6, (0, 2, 4)>
<9, (0, 1, 4)>

Count of 3-stars: [6]
