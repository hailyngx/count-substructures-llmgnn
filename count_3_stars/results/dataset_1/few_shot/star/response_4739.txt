Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star-like pattern.

From the adjacency list, we can see that the nodes with the following connections form 3-stars:
- Node 1: (1, 2, 4, 5)
- Node 2: (2, 1, 5, 6)
- Node 5: (5, 1, 2, 3)
- Node 6: (6, 0, 2, 9)

Observing these connections, we can list the unique 3-stars:
<1, (2, 4, 5)>, <2, (1, 5, 6)>, <5, (1, 2, 3)>, <6, (0, 2, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
