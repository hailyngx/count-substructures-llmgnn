Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a 3-star pattern.

Looking at the adjacency list, the 3-star patterns can be identified as follows:

<2, (3, 4, 7)>
<2, (3, 4, 8)>
<2, (3, 8, 7)>
<2, (4, 8, 7)>
<3, (0, 5, 2)>
<3, (2, 5, 4)>
<8, (2, 9, 6)>
<6, (4, 8, 9)>
<6, (5, 8, 9)>
<6, (8, 9, 7)>

Counting all these unique 3-star patterns gives a total of [10] 3-stars in the graph.
