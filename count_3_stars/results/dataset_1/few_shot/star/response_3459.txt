Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star-like formation.

Looking at the adjacency list and the definition of a 3-star graph, we can see that for a 3-star to exist, a central node should have exactly three adjacent nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Node 1 is a central node with three adjacent nodes: 3, 7, and 9. Thus, we have the 3-star <1, (3, 7, 9)>.

2. Node 3 is a central node with three adjacent nodes: 1, 5, and 6. Thus, we have the 3-star <3, (1, 5, 6)>.

3. Node 7 is a central node with three adjacent nodes: 1, 6, and 8. Thus, we have the 3-star <7, (1, 6, 8)>.

4. Node 8 is a central node with three adjacent nodes: 3, 5, and 9. Thus, we have the 3-star <8, (3, 5, 9)>.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is 4.

Unique 3-stars found:
<1, (3, 7, 9)>
<3, (1, 5, 6)>
<7, (1, 6, 8)>
<8, (3, 5, 9)>
