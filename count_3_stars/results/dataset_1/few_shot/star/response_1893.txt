Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
First, let's identify which nodes can be the central node of a 3-star. In a 3-star, the center node must have exactly three neighbors.

Given the adjacency list:
- Node 0 has 1 neighbor
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 1 neighbor
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors
- Node 7 has 0 neighbors
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors
- Node 9 has 0 neighbors

So, the potential central nodes for 3-stars are: 1, 4, 5, and 6.

Next, let's check each potential central node and count the number of 3-stars formed:
1. Central node 1: 
   - (1, 3, 5)
   - (1, 5, 8)
   <1, (3, 5, 6)>
   This makes a total of 3 3-stars for central node 1.

2. Central node 4: 
   - (4, 0, 3)
   - (4, 3, 8)
   - (4, 0, 8)
   This makes a total of 3 3-stars for central node 4.

3. Central node 5:
   - (5, 1, 8)
   This makes a total of 1 3-star for central node 5.

4. Central node 6:
   - (6, 1, 2)
   This makes a total of 1 3-star for central node 6.

[Total number of 3-stars in the graph: 3]  
<1, (3, 5, 6)>, <4, (0, 3, 8)>, <5, (1, 8)>, <6, (1, 2)>
