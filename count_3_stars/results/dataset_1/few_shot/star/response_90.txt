Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, and node 8
