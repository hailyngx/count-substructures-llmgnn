Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, and node 7

Response:
The central node of a 3-star graph is connected to exactly three other nodes. 
Let's list all the 3-stars in this graph:

<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<0, (1, 6, 8)>
<0, (1, 8, 9)>
<0, (2, 4, 9)>
<1, (0, 6, 7)>
<1, (0, 7, 9)>
<5, (6, 7, 8)>
<5, (6, 8, 9)>
<5, (7, 8, 9)>
<6, (0, 1, 3)>
<6, (0, 3, 5)>
<6, (1, 3, 5)>

Therefore, there are [13] 3-stars in the given graph.
