Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern. 

From the adjacency list and the provided edges, we can see the following 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (3, 9, _)>
<2, (5, 8, 9)>
<3, (0, 4, 6)>
<4, (3, 5, 8)>
<5, (2, 4, 7)>
<6, (1, 3, _)>
<7, (4, 5, _)>
<8, (2, 4, _)>
<9, (0, 2, 5)>

Count of 3-stars in the graph: [9]
