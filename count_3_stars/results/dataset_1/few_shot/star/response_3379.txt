Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star-like configuration.

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (4, 5, 8)>
<1, (3, 5, 8)>
<3, (1, 7, 9)>
<5, (0, 1, 9)>
<8, (0, 1, 9)>

Count of 3-stars: [5]
