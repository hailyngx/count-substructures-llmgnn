Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. We can then list these unique 3-stars. 

Let's start by listing the 3-stars:
<0, (3, 4, 8)>
<1, (3, 7, 9)>
<2, (6, 7, 8)>
<3, (0, 1, 5)>
<6, (2, 3, 8)>
<8, (0, 6, 9)>
<9, (1, 6, 8)>

Now, we count the total number of 3-stars in the graph: [7].
