Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 9) (7, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star by finding the central node and its three connected nodes. 

Let's find the 3-stars in the graph:
1. From the adjacency list, we identify the nodes and their connections.
2. For each node with exactly three neighbors, we check if it forms a 3-star.
3. We consider all possible combinations where a node is the center and the three connected nodes are the leaves.

Below are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (2, 3, 7)>
<2, (0, 3, 8)>
<3, (0, 1, 4)>
<8, (2, 3, 9)>
