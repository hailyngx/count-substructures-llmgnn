Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 44 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

After analyzing the adjacency list for each node and the provided edges, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph. Let's list them below:

<0, (1, 6, 8)>
<1, (0, 6, 8)>
<2, (6, 7, 8)>
<3, (1, 5, 8)>
<4, (5, 7, 9)>
<5, (3, 4, 6)>
<6, (0, 1, 2)>
<7, (4, 5, 9)>
<8, (0, 1, 2)>
<9, (0, 4, 6)>

Count of 3-stars: [10]
