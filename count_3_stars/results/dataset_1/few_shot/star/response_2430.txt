Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 7

Response:
There are 3-star structures found in this graph. Let's identify and count them step by step.

Step 1: Identify potential center nodes. Central nodes in 3-star structures are the nodes with degree 3.

The potential center nodes are: Node 2 and Node 4.

Step 2: For each potential center node, identify the connected nodes to form 3-stars.

For Node 2:
<2, (1, 4, 9)>
<2, (4, 8, 9)>

For Node 4:
<4, (1, 2, 5)>
<4, (1, 3, 9)>
<4, (2, 1, 5)>
<4, (2, 3, 9)>
<4, (5, 1, 2)>
<4, (5, 1, 9)>
<4, (5, 2, 1)>
<4, (5, 9, 1)>
<4, (9, 1, 2)>
<4, (9, 1, 5)>
<4, (9, 2, 1)>
<4, (9, 5, 1)>

Step 3: Count the total number of unique 3-stars.

The unique 3-stars identified are: 
<2, (1, 4, 9)>
<2, (4, 8, 9)>
<4, (1, 2, 5)>
<4, (1, 3, 9)>
<4, (2, 1, 5)>
<4, (2, 3, 9)>
<4, (5, 1, 2)>
<4, (5, 1, 9)>
<4, (5, 2, 1)>
<4, (5, 9, 1)>
<4, (9, 1, 2)>
<4, (9, 1, 5)>
<4, (9, 2, 1)>
<4, (9, 5, 1)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
