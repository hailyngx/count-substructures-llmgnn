Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 4) (6, 9) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's first list out all the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (1, 9)>
<1, (0, 5, 9)>
<4, (5, 6, 8)>
<5, (1, 4)>
<6, (4, 9)>
<8, (4, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 6)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph by listing them:
