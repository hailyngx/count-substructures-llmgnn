Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, 7, and node 8

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a 3-star pattern. Let's go through each node to identify all unique 3-stars:

- From Node 0, there are no 3-stars since it is only connected to 2 other nodes.

- From Node 1, we have the following 3-stars:
  <1, (5, 8, 9)>

- From Node 2, there are no 3-stars since it is only connected to 1 other node.

- From Node 3, we have the following 3-stars:
  <3, (4, 6, 0)>

- From Node 4, we have the following 3-stars:
  <4, (3, 7, 0)>

- From Node 5, we have the following 3-stars:
  <5, (7, 8, 1)>
  <5, (7, 9, 1)>
  <5, (8, 9, 1)>

- From Node 6, there are no 3-stars since it is only connected to 2 other nodes.

- From Node 7, we have the following 3-stars:
  <7, (5, 8, 9)>
  <7, (8, 9, 5)>

- From Node 8, there are no 3-stars since it is only connected to 3 other nodes.

- From Node 9, there are no 3-stars since it is connected to more than 3 other nodes.

Count of 3-stars: [9]
Unique 3-stars: <<1, (5, 8, 9)>, <3, (4, 6, 0)>, <4, (3, 7, 0)>, <5, (7, 8, 1)>, <5, (7, 9, 1)>, <5, (8, 9, 1)>, <7, (5, 8, 9)>, <7, (8, 9, 5)>]
