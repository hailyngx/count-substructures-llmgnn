Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 4, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 6

Response:
Let's first identify the central nodes of the possible 3-stars. Central nodes will be the nodes that have exactly three neighbors in the graph. 

From the adjacency list, we can see that the following nodes have exactly three adjacent nodes:
- Node 1 (connected to nodes 0, 5, 8)
- Node 3 (connected to nodes 0, 5)
- Node 7 (connected to nodes 4, 8)
- Node 9 (connected to nodes 2, 6)

Now, let's find the 3-stars in the graph using these central nodes.

1. Central Node: 1
   - <1, (0, 5, 8)>

2. Central Node: 3
   - <3, (0, 5, _)> (Node 3 is missing a fourth edge to form a complete 3-star)

3. Central Node: 7
   - <7, (4, 8, _)> (Node 7 is missing a fourth edge to form a complete 3-star)

4. Central Node: 9
   - <9, (2, 6, _)> (Node 9 is missing a fourth edge to form a complete 3-star)

Therefore, there is only one complete 3-star in this graph. 
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1].
