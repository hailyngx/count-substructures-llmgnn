Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 9
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star pattern, which consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Looking at the adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars:
1. <0, (1, 5, 7)>
2. <1, (0, 4, 9)>
3. <4, (1, 6, 7)>
4. <5, (0, 2, 6)>
5. <6, (3, 4, 5)>
6. <7, (0, 4, 9)>
7. <9, (1, 5, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
