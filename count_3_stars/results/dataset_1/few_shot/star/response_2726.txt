Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 6) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars, we first look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will be the centers of the 3-stars.

In this graph, node 1, node 4, and node 9 are connected to exactly three other nodes each. We will now identify the 3-stars formed around these nodes.

For node 1:
- 3-star with center node 1: <1, (6, 9, 4)>
- 3-star with center node 1: <1, (6, 9, 5)>
[2]

For node 4:
- 3-star with center node 4: <4, (6, 9, 1)>
- 3-star with center node 4: <4, (6, 9, 5)>
[2]

For node 9:
- 3-star with center node 9: <9, (1, 6, 4)>
- 3-star with center node 9: <9, (1, 6, 5)>
[2]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
