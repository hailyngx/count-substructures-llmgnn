Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly 3 other nodes. These nodes will serve as the centers of the 3-stars. 

After examining the given graph, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (6, 9)>
<1, (3, 6, 7)>
<2, (3, 5, 6)>
<4, (3, 7, 9)>
<7, (1, 4, 5)>
<9, (0, 4, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (6, 9)>, <1, (3, 6, 7)>, <2, (3, 5, 6)>, <4, (3, 7, 9)>, <7, (1, 4, 5)>, <9, (0, 4, 7)>.
