Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 5

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star pattern. 

Let's go through the list of nodes and their connections to identify the 3-stars:

1. Node 0: Connected to nodes 1, 4, 5, 7, and 8
   - Possible 3-star with node 0 as the center: <0, (1, 5, 8)>
2. Node 1: Connected to nodes 0 and 5
   - No 3-star pattern found as it is only connected to two nodes.
3. Node 2: Connected to nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9
   - Possible 3-star with node 2 as the center: <2, (6, 8, 9)>
4. Node 3: Connected to nodes 5, 7, and 9
   - Possible 3-star with node 3 as the center: <3, (5, 7, 9)>
5. Node 4: Connected to node 0
   - No 3-star pattern found as it is only connected to one node.
6. Node 5: Connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, 8, and 9
   - Possible 3-star with node 5 as the center: <5, (0, 3, 9)>
7. Node 6: Connected to node 2
   - No 3-star pattern found as it is only connected to one node.
8. Node 7: Connected to nodes 0, 2, and 3
   - Possible 3-star with node 7 as the center: <7, (0, 2, 3)>
9. Node 8: Connected to nodes 0, 2, and 5
   - Possible 3-star with node 8 as the center: <8, (0, 2, 5)>
10. Node 9: Connected to nodes 2, 3, and 5
   - Possible 3-star with node 9 as the center: <9, (2, 3, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5] and the unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (1, 5, 8)>, <2, (6, 8, 9)>, <3, (5, 7, 9)>, <5, (0, 3, 9)>, <7, (0, 2, 3)>, <8, (0, 2, 5)>, <9, (2, 3, 5)>
