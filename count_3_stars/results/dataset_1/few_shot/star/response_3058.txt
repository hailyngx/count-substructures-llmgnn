Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through the graph step by step to find all the 3-stars.

1. Check Node 0:
   - Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 9 and 0. <0, (3, 9, 0)>

2. Check Node 1:
   - Node 1 does not form a 3-star because it is connected to 2 nodes.

3. Check Node 2:
   - Node 2 does not form a 3-star because it is connected to only 1 node.

4. Check Node 3:
   - Node 3 does not form a 3-star; it is connected to 4 nodes.

5. Check Node 4:
   - Node 4 does not form a 3-star; it is connected to 2 nodes.

6. Check Node 5:
   - Node 5 does not form a 3-star; it is connected to 4 nodes.

7. Check Node 6:
   - Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 9 and 6. <6, (7, 9, 6)>

8. Check Node 7:
   - Node 7 does not form a 3-star; it is connected to 3 nodes but does not meet the 3-star criteria.

9. Check Node 8:
   - Node 8 does not form a 3-star because it is connected to 1 node.

10. Check Node 9:
   - Node 9 does not form a 3-star; it is connected to 4 nodes.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
The unique 3-stars found are: <<0, (3, 9, 0)>, <6, (7, 9, 6)>>.
