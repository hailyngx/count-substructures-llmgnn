Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 9

Node 7 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will serve as the central nodes of the 3-stars. Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph step by step:

1. Node 7 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9. Since it is connected to exactly three other nodes (3, 4, and 5), it forms a 3-star. Let's represent this 3-star as <7, (3, 4, 5)>.

2. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 7, and 8. Since it is connected to exactly three other nodes (0, 4, and 8), it forms another 3-star. Let's represent this 3-star as <3, (0, 4, 8)>.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].

Unique 3-stars: <7, (3, 4, 5)>, <3, (0, 4, 8)>
