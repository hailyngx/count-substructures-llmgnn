Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify all instances where the center node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the provided graph and adjacency list, we can find the following 3-stars:
1. <0, (3, 5, 7)>
2. <7, (4, 6, 9)>
3. <5, (1, 7, 9)>
4. <9, (0, 5, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
