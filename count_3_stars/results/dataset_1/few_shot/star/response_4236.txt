Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 5, and node 8
