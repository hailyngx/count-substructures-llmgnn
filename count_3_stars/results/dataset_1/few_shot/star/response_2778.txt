Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 7

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph:

- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 4, and 7: <0, (3, 4, 7)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 5, and 6: <2, (1, 5, 6)> 

[There are 2 unique 3-stars in the graph.]
