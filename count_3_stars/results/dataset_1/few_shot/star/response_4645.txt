Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 6

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0: No 3-star can be formed around node 0 as it is only connected to 2 nodes (2 and 4).

2. Node 1: No 3-star can be formed around node 1 as it is only connected to 2 nodes (3 and 9).

3. Node 2: No 3-star can be formed around node 2 as it is only connected to 1 node (0).

4. Node 3: <3, (1, 5, 7)>, <3, (1, 5, 8)>

5. Node 4: <4, (0, 6, 7)>

6. Node 5: <5, (3, 6, 9)>

7. Node 6: <6, (4, 5, 7)>, <6, (4, 5, 9)>, <6, (4, 7, 9)>

8. Node 7: No 3-star can be formed around node 7 as it is only connected to 3 nodes (3, 4, 6).

9. Node 8: No 3-star can be formed around node 8 as it is only connected to 1 node (3).

10. Node 9: No 3-star can be formed around node 9 as it is only connected to 3 nodes (1, 5, 6).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
