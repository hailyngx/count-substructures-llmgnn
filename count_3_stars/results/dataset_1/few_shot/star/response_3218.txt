Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 5, and node 7

Response:
Given the information provided, we can determine the number of 3-stars in the graph. Let's identify the 3-stars step by step:

1. Node 0: Not part of any 3-star.
2. Node 1: Not part of any 3-star.
3. Node 2: Forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 3, and 4. <2, (0, 3, 4)>
4. Node 3: Forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 4, and 5. <3, (2, 4, 5)>
5. Node 4: Forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 2, and 5. <4, (3, 2, 5)>
6. Node 5: Not part of any 3-star.
7. Node 6: Not part of any 3-star.
8. Node 7: Not part of any 3-star.
9. Node 8: Not part of any 3-star.
10. Node 9: Not part of any 3-star.

Therefore, by counting the unique 3-stars identified above, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3]. 

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<2, (0, 3, 4)>
<3, (2, 4, 5)>
<4, (3, 2, 5)>
