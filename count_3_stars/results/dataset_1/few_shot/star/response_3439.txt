Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Based on the provided information, the 3-stars in the graph are as follows:
<0, (1, 2, 6)>
<0, (1, 2, 9)>
<0, (1, 6, 9)>
<0, (2, 6, 9)>
<1, (0, 3, 5)>
<2, (0, 7, 6)>
<3, (1, 7, 0)>
<7, (2, 3, 8)>
<8, (7, 9, 0)>
<9, (4, 8, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
