Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 5

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star structures in the given graph.

The possible 3-star structures can be formed when a node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes. Based on the given information, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<1, (4, 5, 6)>
<4, (0, 3, 9)>
<5, (0, 1, 9)>

To count the total number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to calculate the number of occurrences of each unique 3-star structure.

Hence, we have:
