Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 1
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
Given the graph information, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph step by step:

Step 1: Identify the possible 3-stars using the definition provided:

- A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Step 2: Identify the nodes in the graph:
Nodes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8

Step 3: Count the number of 3-stars:
- Looking at the adjacency list, we can see that nodes 1, 3, 4, and 8 have degrees equal to 3, making them potential central nodes of 3-stars.
- For each potential central node, we will check the connected nodes to form 3-stars.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:

[3]
<1, (3, 5, 8)>
<3, (1, 5, 7)>
<4, (1, 5, 7)>
<8, (1, 3, 7)>

[4 unique 3-stars]
