Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Analyzing the provided adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars:

- <0, (4, 8, 9)>
- <2, (5, 6, 8)>
- <3, (5, 7, 9)>
- <6, (1, 2, 7)>
- <8, (0, 2, 9)>
- <9, (0, 3, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
