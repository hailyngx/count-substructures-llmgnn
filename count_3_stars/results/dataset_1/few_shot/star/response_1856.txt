Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through the nodes one by one and identify the 3-star structures:

1. For Node 0:
   - <0, (4, 6, 8)>

2. For Node 1:
   - <1, (4, 7, 8)>
   - <1, (4, 8, 9)>

3. For Node 2:
   - <2, (5, 7, 8)>

4. For Node 4:
   - <4, (0, 1, 9)>
    
5. For Node 5:
   - <5, (2, 7, 8)>

6. For Node 6:
   - <6, (0, 7, 8)>
    
7. For Node 8:
   - <8, (0, 1, 5)>

8. For Node 9:
   - <9, (1, 2, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
