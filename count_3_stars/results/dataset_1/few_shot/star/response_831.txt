Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in the graph.

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 4 is connected to nodes 3, 6, 7. <4, (3, 6, 7)>
2. Node 2 is connected to nodes 6, 9, 7. <2, (6, 9, 7)>

Count of 3-stars in the graph: [2]

<4, (3, 6, 7)>, <2, (6, 9, 7)>
