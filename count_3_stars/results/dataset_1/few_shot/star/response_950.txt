Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 3

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible 3-stars by looking for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a star-like shape around the central node.

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
1. <0, (1, 4, 6)>
2. <0, (1, 6, 8)>
3. <1, (0, 9, 2)>
4. <6, (0, 3, 7)>
5. <8, (0, 5, 7)>
6. <9, (1, 2, 3)>

Counting the unique 3-stars we found, we get a total of [6].
