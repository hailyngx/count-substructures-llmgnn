Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 7

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph:

<0, (6, 9, 6)>
<1, (2, 4, 2)>
<2, (1, 4, 7)>
<2, (4, 1, 8)>
<4, (1, 2, 6)>
<6, (0, 4, 9)>
<7, (2, 5, 9)>
<9, (0, 6, 7)>

Count of 3-star graphs: [8]
