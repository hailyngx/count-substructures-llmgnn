Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 8

Response:
The process to count the number of 3-stars in the given graph is as follows:

1. Identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will serve as the central nodes of the 3-stars.
    - In this case, nodes 0, 1, 2, and 8 are connected to exactly three other nodes.

2. For each identified central node, list out the adjacent nodes. These will be the leaves of the 3-stars.

3. Count the unique 3-stars formed by combining each central node with its adjacent nodes.

Let's go through the process step by step:

For node 0:
Adjacent nodes: 1, 2, 4, 7
3-stars for node 0:
<0, (1, 2, 7)>
[1]

For node 1:
Adjacent nodes: 0, 2, 6, 7, 8
3-stars for node 1:
<1, (0, 2, 7)>
<1, (0, 2, 8)>
<1, (2, 6, 8)>
[3]

For node 2:
Adjacent nodes: 0, 1, 3, 6, 8
3-stars for node 2:
<2, (0, 1, 8)>
<2, (1, 3, 8)>
<2, (0, 6, 8)>
[3]

For node 8:
Adjacent nodes: 1, 2, 6, 9
3-stars for node 8:
<8, (1, 2, 6)>
<8, (1, 2, 9)>
[2]

[Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 3 + 3 + 2 = 9]
