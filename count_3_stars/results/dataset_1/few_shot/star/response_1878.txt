Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 3
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 3
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern in the graph.

Let's list down the 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<2, (1, 7, 3)>
<3, (1, 4, 7)>
<6, (0, 7, 1)>
<7, (2, 3, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
