Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to understand that a 3-star is formed by a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

From the adjacency list, we can identify the 3-star structures in the graph:
<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<1, (0, 4, 5)>
<3, (0, 2, 7)>
<5, (0, 1, 4)>
<8, (1, 5, 9)>
<9, (3, 8)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
