Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 4, 7, and node 8

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph:

From the adjacency list:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 5
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 4, 9
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 6, 8
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 7, 9
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 4, 7, 8

So, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
Unique 3-stars: <0, (1, 5)>, <1, (0, 4, 9)>, <2, (5, 6, 8)>, <4, (1, 7, 9)>, <9, (1, 4, 7, 8)>
