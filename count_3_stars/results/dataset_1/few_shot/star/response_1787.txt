Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify all unique sets of 3 nodes where one node is connected to the other two nodes directly. From the provided graph and adjacency list, we can see that a 3-star pattern involves the center node being connected to exactly 3 leaves.

Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

<1, (3, 5)>
<3, (1, 4, 6)>
<4, (3, 5, 7)>
<5, (1, 4)>
<6, (0, 3)>
<7, (3, 4, 8)>
<8, (3, 7, 9)>
<9, (4, 8)>

Since we have identified all the 3-stars, we can count them to find the total number.
