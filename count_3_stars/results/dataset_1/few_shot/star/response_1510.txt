Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 5

Response:
There are 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are:

<1, (2, 3, 5)>
<2, (6, 7, 4)>
<3, (6, 8, 9)>
<4, (7, 8, 5)>
<5, (6, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
