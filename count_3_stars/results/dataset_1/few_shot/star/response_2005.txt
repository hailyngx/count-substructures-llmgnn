Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes (leaves). 

Given the adjacency list and edge list, we can determine the 3-stars in the graph. 

Let's list down the 3-stars in this graph:

<1, (6, 8, 9)>
<6, (1, 4, 9)>
<8, (1, 5, 9)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars: [3]
