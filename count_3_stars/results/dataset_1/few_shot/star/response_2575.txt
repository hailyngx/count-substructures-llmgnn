Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 4

Response:
Given the information provided, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph by looking for nodes with exactly three adjacent nodes. 

The 3-stars in the graph are:
<1, (3, 8, 2)>
<2, (3, 7, 9)>
<3, (1, 2, 5)>
<4, (6, 9, 5)>
<7, (2, 8, 9)>
<8, (1, 7, 2)>
<9, (2, 4, 8)>

Count of 3-stars: [7]
