Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 7

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are as follows:

<2, (0, 3, 5)>
<2, (8, 9, 7)>
<5, (1, 2, 7)> 
<7, (4, 6, 9)> 

Therefore, the total number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [4].
