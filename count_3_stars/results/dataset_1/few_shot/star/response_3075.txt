Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 5
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that has exactly three edges and forms a 3-star. 

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (6, 7, 9)>
<5, (1, 4, 6)>
<9, (0, 3, 8)>

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
