Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, and node 8

Response:
At first glance, we can identify the following 3-stars in the graph based on the definition provided:

<0, (2, 6, 8)>
<1, (3, 5, 8)>
<2, (0, 5, 9)>
<3, (1, 4, 8)>
<8, (0, 1, 3)>
<9, (2, 3, 6)>

By carefully examining the edges and adjacency list, we can see that these 3-stars are the only ones present in the given graph. Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
