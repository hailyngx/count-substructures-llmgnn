Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 3

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star configuration. 

From the provided information, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (1, 6, 2)>
<1, (0, 4, 5)>
<2, (6, 7, 0)>
<3, (6, 9, -)>
<6, (0, 5, 2)>
<7, (1, 2, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6]. 
Summary of unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 6, 2)>
<1, (0, 4, 5)>
<2, (6, 7, 0)>
<3, (6, 9, -)>
<6, (0, 5, 2)>
<7, (1, 2, 8)>
