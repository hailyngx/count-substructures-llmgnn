Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 8

Response:
The 3-stars present in the given graph are as follows:

<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<1, (2, 4, 7)>
<2, (1, 4, 8)>
<3, (7, 9)>
<4, (0, 1, 2)>
<5, (0, 9)>
<6, (0, 2)>
<7, (1, 3, 8)>
<8, (2, 4, 7)>
<9, (3, 4, 5)>

Therefore, there are a total of [10] unique 3-stars in the graph.
