Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 3) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 3
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 4, and node 9
