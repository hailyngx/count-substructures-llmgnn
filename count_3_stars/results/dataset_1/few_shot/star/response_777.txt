Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars present in the graph. 

Let's start by looking at each node and its connections to find 3-stars. 

From the adjacency list, we see that the possible 3-stars can be formed around the following nodes:
- Node 0
- Node 1
- Node 3
- Node 4
- Node 9

Let's list the unique 3-stars found:

<0, (1, 3, 7)>
<3, (0, 1, 9)>
<4, (0, 2, 7)>
<9, (1, 5, 8)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
