Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 9) (3, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 9
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 5, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the 3-stars, which are subgraphs consisting of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's find the 3-stars in the graph:

1. For Node 0:
   - 3-star: <0, (1, 8, 9)>

2. For Node 1:
   - No 3-stars, as it is only connected to Node 0.

3. For Node 2:
   - No 3-stars, as it is only connected to Node 9.

4. For Node 3:
   - No 3-stars, as it is only connected to Node 9.

5. For Node 4:
   - Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.

6. For Node 5:
   - 3-star: <5, (6, 8, 9)>

7. For Node 6:
   - 3-star: <6, (5, 7, 9)>

8. For Node 7:
   - No 3-stars, as it is only connected to Node 6.

9. For Node 8:
   - No 3-stars, as it is only connected to Node 0 and Node 5.

10. For Node 9:
   - No unique 3-stars for Node 9 as it is connected to Node 0, 2, 3, 5, and 6 which have already been considered.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2] and they are <0, (1, 8, 9)> and <5, (6, 8, 9)>.
