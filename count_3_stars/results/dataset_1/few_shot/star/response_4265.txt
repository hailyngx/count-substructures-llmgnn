Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 6

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 

The 3-stars can be represented as follows:
<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<2, (0, 6, 7)>
<4, (0, 1, 8)>
<7, (2, 3, 5)>
<6, (2, 3, 9)>

So, there are [5] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
