Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 9) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 9
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 5, and node 7

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. From the given information, we can see that the nodes in the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}.

2. Look for each node that has exactly 3 edges connected to it. These nodes will serve as the center of a 3-star.

3. Analyzing the graph, we find that node 4 is the center of a 3-star since it is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 8.

4. Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph can be found within brackets []: [1].

5. The unique 3-star found in the graph is: <4, (2, 3, 8)>.
