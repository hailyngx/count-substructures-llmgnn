Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 7

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes (forming a 3-star pattern). 

Looking at the adjacency list for each node, we can identify the following 3-stars:

<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<2, (1, 4, 7)>
<4, (0, 1, 7)>
<6, (1, 4, 7)>
<7, (1, 2, 4)>

Counting all unique 3-stars, we have a total of [5] 3-stars in the graph.
