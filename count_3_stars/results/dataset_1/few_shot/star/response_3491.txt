Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 6

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are part of a 3-star. A 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we can identify the following potential 3-stars:
- Node 0: (2, 8, 5)
- Node 2: (0, 5, 6), (5, 3, 4), (5, 8, 9)
- Node 4: (5, 9, 2)
- Node 5: (2, 0, 8), (2, 3, 4), (2, 4, 9), (8, 0, 2)
- Node 6: (2, 9, 0)
- Node 8: (0, 2, 5)

Now let's count the unique 3-stars:
- <0, (2, 8, 5)>
- <2, (0, 5, 6)>
- <2, (5, 3, 4)>
- <2, (5, 8, 9)>
- <4, (5, 9, 2)>
- <5, (2, 3, 4)>
- <5, (2, 4, 9)>
- <5, (8, 0, 2)>
- <6, (2, 9, 0)>
- <8, (0, 2, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
