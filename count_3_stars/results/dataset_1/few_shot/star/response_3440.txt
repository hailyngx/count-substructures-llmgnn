Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 2

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 0 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 3, 6, and 7. <0, (3, 6, 7)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 0, 1, and 5. <8, (0, 1, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
