Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 3

Response:
To count the number of 3-star motifs in the graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes. These nodes form a 3-star pattern with the chosen node as the center.

By examining the given graph and its adjacency list, we can identify the 3-star motifs:

<1, (0, 4, 5)>
<4, (0, 1, 5)>
<5, (1, 4, 6)>
<6, (1, 3, 5)>
<7, (1, 2, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
