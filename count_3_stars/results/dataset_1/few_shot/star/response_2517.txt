Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 6

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph by looking for nodes that are the center of a 3-star. 

Node 1 can form a 3-star with (3, 6, 9).
Node 3 can form two 3-stars: (1, 6, 9) and (0, 5, 7).
Node 5 can form two 3-stars: (0, 2, 5) and (6, 8, 9).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [5].

Unique 3-stars:
<1, (3, 6, 9)>
<3, (0, 5, 7)>
<5, (0, 2, 5)>
<5, (6, 8, 9)>
