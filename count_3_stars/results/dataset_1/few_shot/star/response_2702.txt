Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 7

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that can act as the center of a 3-star graph. These nodes must have exactly 3 neighbors.

Nodes that have exactly 3 neighbors:
- Node 0 (neighbors: 3, 6, 7)
- Node 3 (neighbors: 0, 7, 9)
- Node 7 (neighbors: 0, 3, 5, 9)

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

1. For Node 0:
<0, (3, 6, 7)>

2. For Node 3:
<3, (0, 7, 9)>

3. For Node 7:
<7, (0, 3, 5)>
<7, (0, 3, 9)>
<7, (0, 5, 9)>
<7, (3, 5, 9)>

Therefore, there are [7] 3-stars in the given graph.
