Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list the 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<1, (0, 8, 9)>
<4, (0, 6, 8)>
<7, (0, 2, 9)>
<8, (0, 1, 4)>
<9, (1, 7, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
