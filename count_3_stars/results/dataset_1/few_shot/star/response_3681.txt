Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 8

Response:
First, we determine which nodes can be the center of a 3-star graph by looking for nodes with exactly three neighbors:

- Node 2 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors.
- Nodes 0, 1, 4, 6, 7, and 8 have more than 3 neighbors.

Therefore, only Node 9 can be the center of a 3-star graph.

Next, we identify the 3-star graphs with Node 9 as the center:

<9, (2, 3, 8)>
<9, (3, 8, 9)>

Counting the total number of unique 3-stars, we find [2].
