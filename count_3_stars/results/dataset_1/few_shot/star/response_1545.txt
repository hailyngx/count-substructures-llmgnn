Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Looking at the adjacency list of each node, we can identify the following unique 3-stars:

<0, (1, 4, 9)>
<1, (0, 3, 5)>
<3, (1, 6, 9)>
<4, (0, 2, 5)>
<5, (1, 4, 6)>
<6, (3, 5, 7)>
<7, (4, 6)>
<9, (0, 1, 3)>

Counting these unique 3-stars, we find that there are 8 such structures. Therefore, the final answer is [8].
