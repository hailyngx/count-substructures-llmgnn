Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 4, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 8

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (1, 2, 3)>
2. <0, (1, 2, 4)>
3. <0, (1, 2, 8)>
4. <0, (1, 3, 5)>
5. <0, (2, 5, 8)>
6. <1, (0, 2, 3)>
7. <1, (0, 2, 4)>
8. <1, (0, 2, 8)>
9. <2, (0, 1, 5)>
10. <2, (0, 5, 8)>
11. <2, (7, 8, 9)>
12. <3, (0, 1, 5)>
13. <5, (0, 2, 8)>
14. <8, (0, 2, 5)>
15. <8, (0, 2, 9)>
16. <8, (7, 9, 2)>
17. <9, (2, 7, 8)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [17].
