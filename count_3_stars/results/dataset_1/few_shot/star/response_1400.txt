Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the unique 3-stars in the graph where one node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the provided adjacency list and the given edges, we can identify the 3-stars as follows:

1. Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 2, and 5: <0, (1, 2, 5)>
2. Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 5, and 9: <0, (2, 5, 9)>
3. Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 6, and 8: <2, (3, 6, 8)>
4. Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 8, and 9: <6, (5, 8, 9)>
5. Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 4, and 6: <9, (0, 4, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
