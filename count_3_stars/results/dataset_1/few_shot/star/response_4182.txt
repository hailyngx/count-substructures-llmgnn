Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first identify the nodes where a 3-star pattern can be formed with the center node having exactly three edges connected to other nodes.

In this graph, the nodes that can act as the center of a 3-star are nodes 3, 5, and 8 because they each have exactly 3 edges to other nodes.

Now, for each of these potential center nodes, we will list down the 3-stars they form:

For node 3:
<3, (4, 5, 6)>
<3, (5, 7, 9)>
<3, (6, 7, 8)>
<3, (7, 8, 9)>

For node 5:
<5, (1, 3, 9)>

For node 8:
<8, (0, 1, 2)>
<8, (0, 2, 4)>
<8, (1, 2, 3)>
<8, (1, 3, 9)>
<8, (2, 3, 7)>
<8, (3, 4, 6)>

Counting all unique 3-stars found, we get: [11]

Therefore, the final count of unique 3-stars in the given graph is [11].
