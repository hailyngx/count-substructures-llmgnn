Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star, which consists of a central node and three connected nodes. Let's go through the graph step by step to find all the 3-stars:

1. For Node 0:
   - 3-star centered at Node 0: <0, (1, 4, 7)>
   
2. For Node 1:
   - 3-star centered at Node 1: <1, (0, 4, -)>
   
3. For Node 3:
   - 3-star centered at Node 3: <3, (6, 8, -)>
   
4. For Node 4:
   - 3-star centered at Node 4: <4, (0, 1, 2)>
   
5. For Node 9:
   - 3-star centered at Node 9: <9, (4, 5, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5]. 
The unique 3-star graphs are <0, (1, 4, 7)>, <1, (0, 4, -)>, <3, (6, 8, -)>, <4, (0, 1, 2)>, <9, (4, 5, 8)>.
