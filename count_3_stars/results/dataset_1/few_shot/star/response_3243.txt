Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's go through the nodes one by one:

1. Node 0: Connected to nodes 2, 5, and 9
2. Node 1: Connected to nodes 3 (not a 3-star)
3. Node 2: Connected to nodes 0, 4, and 5
4. Node 3: Connected to nodes 1, 4, and 7
5. Node 4: Connected to nodes 2, 3, and 9
6. Node 5: Connected to nodes 0, 2, and 7
7. Node 6: Connected to nodes 2, 5 (not a 3-star)
8. Node 7: Connected to nodes 2, 3, and 5
9. Node 8: Connected to nodes 4, 9 (not a 3-star)
10. Node 9: Connected to nodes 0, 4, and 8

Based on the connections, we can see that there are two 3-stars in this graph. Now, let's list them:

<0, (2, 5, 9)>
<2, (0, 4, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
