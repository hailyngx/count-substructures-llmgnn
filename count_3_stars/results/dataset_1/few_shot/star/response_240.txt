Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the 3-stars present in the graph. Recall that a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's identify the 3-stars:
1. The central node should have degree 3, and the three connected nodes should not be connected to each other.
2. For each node, check if it satisfies the conditions of being the central node of a 3-star.

Based on the information provided, we can identify the following 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (5, 7, 3)>
<2, (1, 4, 8)>
<4, (2, 8, 9)>
<7, (0, 3, 8)>
<8, (2, 4, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].  
<List of 3-stars: <0, (5, 7, 3)>, <2, (1, 4, 8)>, <4, (2, 8, 9)>, <7, (0, 3, 8)>, <8, (2, 4, 7)>]
