Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 5

Response:
Since a 3-star graph consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, let's list all possible 3-stars in this graph:

<0, (2, 6, 8)>
<1, (2, 4, 5)>
<2, (0, 1, 6)>
<3, (5, 6, x)> - Node 3 is connected to only two other nodes, so it doesn't form a 3-star.
<4, (1, 6, 7)>
<5, (1, 3, 9)>
<6, (0, 2, 4)>
<7, (4, 6, x)> - Node 7 is connected to only one other node, so it doesn't form a 3-star.
<8, (0, 5, x)> - Node 8 is connected to only one other node, so it doesn't form a 3-star.
<9, (1, 5, x)> - Node 9 is connected to only one other node, so it doesn't form a 3-star.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
