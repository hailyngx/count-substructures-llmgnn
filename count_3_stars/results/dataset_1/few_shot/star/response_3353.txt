Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 8

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph can be found by identifying nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them. Let's list them step by step:

Node 0:
- Node 0 has 3 edges connected to it: (0, 3), (0, 6), and (0, 7).
- Therefore, a 3-star centered at node 0 can be formed with leaves 3, 6, and 7: <0, (3, 6, 7)>.

Node 3:
- Node 3 has 4 edges connected to it: (3, 0), (3, 5), (3, 7), and (3, 9).
- Again, a 3-star centered at node 3 can be formed with leaves 0, 5, and 7: <3, (0, 5, 7)>.
- Another 3-star is with nodes 3, 5, and 9: <3, (5, 9)>. 

Node 8:
- Node 8 has 4 edges connected to it: (8, 4), (8, 6), (8, 7), and (8, 9).
- A 3-star centered at node 8 can be formed with leaves 4, 6, and 7: <8, (4, 6, 7)>.
- Another 3-star is with nodes 8, 6, and 9: <8, (6, 9)>.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
The unique 3-stars are <0, (3, 6, 7)>, <3, (0, 5, 7)>, <3, (5, 9)>, <8, (4, 6, 7)>, and <8, (6, 9)>.
