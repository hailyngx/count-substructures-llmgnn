Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star configuration. A 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

From the provided information, we can see that the central node can be any node from 0 to 9. We will check each node to see if it can form a 3-star with its neighbors. 

Here are the unique 3-star configurations found:

<0, (2, 1, 4)>
<1, (2, 7, 8)>
<2, (0, 1, 4)>
<3, (6, 9, 9)>
<4, (0, 2, 5)>
<5, (2, 8, 8)>
<6, (3, 9, 9)>
<7, (1, 9, 9)>
<8, (1, 2, 5)>
<9, (2, 6, 7)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we find that there are [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
