Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

From the information provided, we can determine the following 3-stars:
<1, (2, 6, 5)>
<2, (1, 7, 6)>
<3, (5, 7, 9)>
<6, (2, 8, 9)>
<7, (2, 3, 9)>
<8, (6, 9, -)>
<9, (3, 5, 6)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we have a total of [6] 3-stars in the graph.
