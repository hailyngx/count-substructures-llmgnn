Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 4, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 6

Response:
We can identify the 3-stars in the given graph by looking for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Since a 3-star graph has a center node connected to exactly three leaves, we can find them by examining each node's connections.

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<1, (2, 3, 5)>
<2, (0, 1, 6)>
<4, (0, 6, 8)>
<6, (2, 4, 7)>
<8, (2, 4, 6)>
