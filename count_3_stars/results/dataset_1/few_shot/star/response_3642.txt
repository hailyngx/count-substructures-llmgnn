Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 2

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star structures in the given graph. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we can see that the possible central nodes for 3-stars are nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9. 

Now, let's identify the 3-stars: 
- For node 0: (0, 1, 2), (0, 1, 3), (0, 1, 7)
- For node 1: (1, 0, 4), (1, 0, 8), (1, 0, 9)
- For node 2: (2, 0, 5), (2, 0, 7), (2, 0, 9)
- For node 3: (3, 0, 5), (3, 0, 6)
- For node 4: (4, 1, 7), (4, 1, 8)
- For node 5: (5, 0, 3)
- For node 7: (7, 0, 2), (7, 0, 4)
- For node 8: (8, 1, 4)
- For node 9: (9, 0, 1)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15]. 

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<0, (1, 2, 7)>
<0, (1, 3, 7)>
<1, (0, 4, 8)>
<1, (0, 4, 9)>
<2, (0, 5, 7)>
<2, (0, 5, 9)>
<3, (0, 5, 6)>
<4, (1, 7, 8)>
<7, (0, 2, 4)>
<8, (1, 4, 7)>
<9, (0, 1, 2)>
