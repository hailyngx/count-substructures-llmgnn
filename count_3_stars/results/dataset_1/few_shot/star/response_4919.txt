Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the unique 3-stars:

<0, (2, 7, 9)>
<1, (2, 9, 0)>
<2, (0, 1, 9)>
<3, (0, 4, 9)>
<4, (2, 3, 8)>
<5, (6, 9, 0)>
<6, (5, 8, 0)>
<7, (0, 2, 9)>
<8, (4, 6, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
