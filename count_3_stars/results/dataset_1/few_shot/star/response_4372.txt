Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a 3-star pattern with the selected node as the center.

By looking at the adjacency list, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (1, 8, 9)>
<1, (0, 4, 5)>
<2, (6, 9, 0)>
<4, (1, 3, 5)>
<6, (1, 2, 3)>
<9, (0, 2, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
