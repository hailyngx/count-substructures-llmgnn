Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each instance where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Based on the adjacency list and the given edges, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph. Let's list them:

<0, (6, 9)>
<3, (6, 7, 8)>
<4, (1, 6, 8)>
<9, (0, 4, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
