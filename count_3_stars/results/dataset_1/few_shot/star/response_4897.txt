Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to understand that a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we can determine that the nodes which are connected to exactly three other nodes are: 1, 2, 5, 6, and 9.

Now, let's list the 3-stars present in the graph:
<1, (2, 3, 5)>
<2, (1, 5, 8)>
<5, (1, 2, 9)>
<6, (1, 7, 9)>
<9, (2, 3, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
