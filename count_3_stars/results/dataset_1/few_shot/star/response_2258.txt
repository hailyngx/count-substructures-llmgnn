Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 6
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 9
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern. 

From the given information, we can see that nodes 1, 4, and 7 each connect to three other nodes, making them potential centers of 3-stars. Let's examine each of these nodes to find the unique 3-stars:

1. Node 1:  
    - Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 7.  
    - Possible 3-star: <1, (2, 4, 7)>  

2. Node 4:  
    - Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 6.  
    - Possible 3-star: <4, (1, 3, 6)>  

3. Node 7:  
    - Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 9.  
    - Possible 3-star: <7, (1, 3, 9)>  
    - Another possible 3-star: <7, (1, 7, 9)>  

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].  
The unique 3-stars are <1, (2, 4, 7)>, <4, (1, 3, 6)>, and <7, (1, 3, 9)>.
