Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 8

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Start by identifying the nodes that are connected in 3-stars. For a 3-star, the central node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

2. Look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:

- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 7, and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 6, and 9.

3. Count the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph:

- We can form 3-stars using Node 4 as the center:
  - <4, (1, 7, 8)>
  
- We can also form 3-stars using Node 8 as the center:
  - <8, (0, 4, 6)>
  - <8, (4, 6, 9)>

4. Counting the total number of 3-stars: [3] 

The unique 3-stars are: 
- <4, (1, 7, 8)>
- <8, (0, 4, 6)>
- <8, (4, 6, 9)>
