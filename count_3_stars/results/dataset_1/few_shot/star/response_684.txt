Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges, forming a 3-star structure. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we can see that nodes with 3 connections are: 
- Node 0 (connected to 8, 9)
- Node 2 (connected to 4, 5, 7)
- Node 3 (connected to 4, 8)
- Node 5 (connected to 2, 4)
- Node 6 (connected to 1, 4)
- Node 7 (connected to 2)

Let's list the unique 3-stars found: 
<0, (8, 9)>
<2, (4, 5, 7)>
<3, (4, 8)>
<5, (2, 4)>
<6, (1, 4)>
<7, (2)> 

Count of 3-stars in the given graph: [6]
