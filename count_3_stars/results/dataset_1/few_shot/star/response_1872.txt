Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 5, and node 6

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 6, and 9, forming a 3-star <5, (2, 6, 9)>.
2. Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 9, forming a 3-star <6, (1, 4, 9)>.

Therefore, there are [2] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
