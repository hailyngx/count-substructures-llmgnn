Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 8

Response:
Given the graph, let's find the 3-stars in the graph.

The total number of 3-stars can be calculated by counting the number of unique combinations where a central node is connected to three other nodes.

Observing the adjacency information, we can see the following unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 6, 3)>
<0, (1, 9, 3)>
<0, (3, 6, 9)>
<1, (0, 2, 4)>
<1, (0, 4, 9)>
<2, (1, 6, 7)>
<3, (0, 5, 9)>
<4, (1, 7, 9)>

There are [8] such 3-stars in the given graph.
