Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 8) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 5

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (4, 6, 9)>
2. <1, (4, 5, 9)>
3. <4, (0, 1, 9)>
4. <5, (1, 3, 9)>
5. <6, (0, 8, -)>  (Note: Node 6 is only connected to nodes 0 and 8, missing a third connection for a 3-star)
6. <8, (6, -, -)>  (Note: Node 8 is only connected to node 6, missing two more connections for a 3-star)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
