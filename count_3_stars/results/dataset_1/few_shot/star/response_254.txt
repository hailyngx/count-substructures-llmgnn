Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 5, 7, and node 8

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star configuration. 

Based on the given adjacency list and the definition of a 3-star graph, we can identify the following unique 3-stars:
<1, (2, 4, 7)>
<3, (6, 7, 9)>
<5, (7, 9, -)>
<6, (3, 4, 8)>
<7, (1, 2, 3)>
<8, (6, 7, 9)>
<9, (3, 5, 7)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars gives us a total of [7].
