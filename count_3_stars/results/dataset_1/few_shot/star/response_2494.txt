Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's go through each node:
- Node 0 is not part of any 3-star as it is connected to 4 other nodes.
- Node 1 is not part of any 3-star as it is connected to 2 other nodes.
- Node 2 is part of the 3-star <2, (0, 3, 4)>.
- Node 3 is part of the 3-star <3, (2, 4, 5)>.
- Node 4 is not part of any 3-star as it is connected to only 2 other nodes.
- Node 5 is not part of any 3-star as it is connected to 4 other nodes.
- Node 6 is not part of any 3-star as it is connected to 4 other nodes.
- Node 7 is not part of any 3-star as it is connected to only 2 other nodes.
- Node 8 is part of the 3-stars <8, (0, 3, 5)> and <8, (1, 6, 9)>.
- Node 9 is not part of any 3-star as it is connected to only 1 other node.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4]. 

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
- <2, (0, 3, 4)>
- <3, (2, 4, 5)>
- <8, (0, 3, 5)>
- <8, (1, 6, 9)>
