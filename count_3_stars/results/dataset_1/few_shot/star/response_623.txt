Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, and node 7

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
- Starting with node 0: <0, (3, 7)>
- Moving on to node 1: <1, (4, 7, 9)>
- Next, node 3: <3, (0, 5, 8)>
- Then, node 4: <4, (1, 7)>
- Moving on to node 5: <5, (3, 6, 9)>
- Next, node 6: <6, (5, 9)>
- Then, node 7: <7, (0, 1, 4)>
- Moving on to node 8: <8, (2, 3, 7)>
- Finally, node 9: <9, (1, 5, 6)>

Counting the number of 3-stars in the graph, we have a total of [9].
