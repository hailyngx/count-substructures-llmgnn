Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star configuration. 

Starting with the adjacency list provided, we can find the 3-stars by looking at each node and checking if it satisfies the criteria of a 3-star (a central node connected to exactly three other nodes).

Here are the 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<0, (1, 6, 9)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<1, (0, 7, 8)>
<2, (0, 4, 5)>
<2, (1, 4, 8)>
<2, (8, 9, 0)>
<4, (1, 2, 6)>
<4, (0, 6, 8)>
<8, (1, 2, 4)>
<8, (0, 6, 9)>
<9, (0, 2, 8)>

Count of 3-stars: [12]
