Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 6

Response:
The 3-star graph is a common structure in many networks and is characterized by a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

In this given graph, we need to identify all the 3-stars present. Let's go through each node to determine if it is the center node of a 3-star:

- Node 0: (0, 4, 5), (0, 4, 8), (0, 5, 8)  
- Node 1: No 3-star
- Node 2: No 3-star
- Node 3: (3, 4, 6)   
- Node 4: No 3-star
- Node 5: No 3-star   
- Node 6: (6, 1, 3), (6, 3, 9)  
- Node 7: No 3-star
- Node 8: No 3-star
- Node 9: No 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6] as listed below:
<0, (4, 5, 8)>, <3, (4, 6, 1)>, <3, (6, 3, 9)>, <0, (5, 8, 4)>, <0, (8, 4, 5)>, <0, (4, 8, 5)>
