Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 1

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes to form a 3-star structure.

Considering the information provided, we can see that the following 3-star structures can be formed:
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<1, (0, 2, 5)>
<2, (1, 5, 8)>
<3, (4, 6, 7)>
<4, (0, 3, 8)>
<5, (0, 1, 2)>
<6, (3, 5, 7)>
<7, (0, 3, 6)>
<8, (2, 4, 9)>
<9, (1, 8, 10)>

Count of 3-stars: [10]
