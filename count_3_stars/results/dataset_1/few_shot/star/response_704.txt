Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 7, and node 8

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars in the given graph. 
Since a 3-star consists of a center node and 3 leaf nodes, we can identify the potential center nodes from the adjacency list based on having exactly 3 connections. 
Looking at the adjacency list:
- Node 0 has 2 connections
- Node 1 has 1 connection
- Node 2 has 2 connections
- Node 3 has 2 connections
- Node 4 has 1 connection
- Node 5 has 0 connections
- Node 6 has 1 connection
- Node 7 has 2 connections
- Node 8 has 2 connections
- Node 9 has 5 connections

Therefore, potential center nodes are: 7, 8, 9
Now, let's check each potential center node with its connected nodes to see if they form a 3-star:
- For center node 7: (7, 0, 9) is a 3-star.
- For center node 8: (8, 2, 9) is a 3-star.
- For center node 9: (9, 0, 2), (9, 0, 7), and (9, 2, 8) are 3-stars.

So, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are:
<7, (0, 9)>
<8, (2, 9)>
<9, (0, 2)>
<9, (0, 7)>
<9, (2, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
