Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 3

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star: <0, (1, 6, 9)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (0, 2, 5)>
- Node 6 forms two 3-stars: <6, (0, 2, 5)> and <6, (4, 5, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
