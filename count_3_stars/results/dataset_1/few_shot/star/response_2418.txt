Response:
Since a 3-star graph consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can identify them based on the given graph information.

Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph step by step:

1. Check each node to see if it is connected to exactly three other nodes.

    - Nodes 0, 4, and 5 are not connected to exactly three other nodes, so they cannot be the center of a 3-star.

2. Identify the center node possibilities:

    - Nodes 1, 6, 7, 9 are connected to exactly three other nodes and can potentially be the center of a 3-star.

3. For each potential center node, check if the connections form a valid 3-star. A valid 3-star should have exactly three edges connected to the center node and should not have any edges between the other leaf nodes.

    - For node 1: (1, 2), (1, 8), (1, 9) - This forms a valid 3-star with node 1 as the center.
    - For node 6: (6, 8), (6, 9) - This forms a valid 3-star with node 6 as the center.
    - For node 7: (7, 0), (7, 2), (7, 8) - This forms a valid 3-star with node 7 as the center.
    - For node 9: (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 6) - This forms a valid 3-star with node 9 as the center.

Now we have found all unique 3-stars in the graph: <1, (2, 8, 9)>, <6, (8, 9)>, <7, (0, 2, 8)>, <9, (1, 2, 6)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
