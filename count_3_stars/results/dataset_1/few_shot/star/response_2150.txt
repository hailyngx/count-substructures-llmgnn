Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 9) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 9
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 6

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes with exactly three neighbors. These nodes will be the potential centers of 3-stars in the graph. 

From the adjacency list, the central nodes are: 
- Node 1 (connected to nodes 0, 7, 8)
- Node 8 (connected to nodes 1, 6)
- Node 6 (connected to nodes 8, 9)

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph by examining each potential center's connections:

For Node 1:
- <1, (0, 7, 8)>
- [1 possible 3-star]

For Node 8:
- <8, (1, 6, 7)>
- [1 possible 3-star]

For Node 6:
- <6, (8, 9, 1)>
- [1 possible 3-star]

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3]. 

Result: [3]
