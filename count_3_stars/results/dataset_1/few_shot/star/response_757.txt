Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 9
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 7

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 1: (2, 8, 1)
2. Node 2: (1, 5, 2)
3. Node 3: (4, 5, 9)
4. Node 5: (2, 3, 9)
5. Node 7: (3, 9, 7)
6. Node 9: (3, 5, 7)

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].

Unique 3-star configurations: 
<1, (2, 8, 1)>, <2, (1, 5, 2)>, <3, (4, 5, 9)>, <5, (2, 3, 9)>, <7, (3, 9, 7)>, <9, (3, 5, 7)>
