Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 8

Response:
