Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 0
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, creating a 3-star structure.

Looking at the adjacency list provided:
- Node 3 forms a 3-star structure with the nodes 0, 1, and 8. This gives us the 3-star <3, (0, 1, 8)>.
- Node 8 forms a 3-star structure with the nodes 3 and 4. This gives us the 3-star <8, (3, 4)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
The unique 3-stars found are: <3, (0, 1, 8)>, <8, (3, 4)>.
