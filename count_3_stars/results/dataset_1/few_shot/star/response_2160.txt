Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 3

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star pattern where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list the unique 3-stars:
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<0, (3, 5, 8)>
<0, (4, 5, 8)>
<0, (5, 7, 8)>
<1, (4, 7, 8)>
<3, (0, 5, 9)>
<3, (5, 4, 8)>
<4, (0, 1, 8)>
<5, (0, 2, 7)>
<7, (0, 1, 8)>

Count of unique 3-stars: [10]
