Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Looking at the adjacency list, we can see that nodes 0, 3, 5, and 8 have exactly 3 connections each, forming 3-star structures. Let's list them:
<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<3, (0, 2, 6)>
<5, (0, 1, 6)>
<8, (0, 6, 9)>

Counting these unique 3-stars, we find that there are [4] 3-stars in total in the given graph.
