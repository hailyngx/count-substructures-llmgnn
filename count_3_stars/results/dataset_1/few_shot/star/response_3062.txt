Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central nodes and their corresponding leaves. A 3-star consists of one central node and three leaves connected to the central node.

Let's identify the 3-stars in the provided graph:

1. Node 0: (0, 1, 5, 9)
2. Node 2: (2, 4, 6, 8)
3. Node 4: (4, 5, 6, 8)
4. Node 5: (5, 0, 4, 9)
5. Node 6: (6, 2, 4, 8)
6. Node 8: (8, 2, 4, 6)
7. Node 9: (9, 0, 5)

Count of 3-stars: [7]

Therefore, the final answer is [7].
