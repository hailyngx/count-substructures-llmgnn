Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 8

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the 3-stars by locating nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the given graph, we see that only nodes 0, 1, 4, 7, and 9 satisfy the condition of being connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes can potentially act as the center of a 3-star.

Next, we list out the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<1, (0, 5, 7)>
<4, (0, 2, 6)>
<7, (1, 4, 8)>
<9, (4, 7, 8)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we have a total of [5].
