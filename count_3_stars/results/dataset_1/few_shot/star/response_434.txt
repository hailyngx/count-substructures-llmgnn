Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 7

Response:
Calculating the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Count the number of 3-stars:

We can identify all the 3-stars by looking at each node to see if it is connected to exactly three other nodes forming the shape of a star.

Count of 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star: <0, (5, 6, 8)>
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star: <3, (2, 7, 8)>
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star: <6, (0, 7, 8)>
- Node 7 forms 1 3-star: <7, (3, 6, 9)>
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star: <8, (0, 3, 5)>
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star: <9, (2, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
