Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 8

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node and its three neighboring nodes for each 3-star.

Let's go node by node to identify the 3-stars:

- For Node 1: No 3-star can be formed since it has less than 3 neighbors.
- For Node 2: <2, (1, 3, 4)>
- For Node 3: No 3-star can be formed since it has less than 3 neighbors.
- For Node 4: No 3-star can be formed since it has less than 3 neighbors.
- For Node 5: No 3-star can be formed since it has less than 3 neighbors.
- For Node 6: No 3-star can be formed since it has less than 3 neighbors.
- For Node 7: No 3-star can be formed since it has less than 3 neighbors.
- For Node 8: <8, (3, 4, 9)>
- For Node 9: No 3-star can be formed since it has less than 3 neighbors.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2]. The unique 3-stars are <2, (1, 3, 4)> and <8, (3, 4, 9)>.
