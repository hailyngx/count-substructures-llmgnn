Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 6) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

By examining the adjacency list and given edges, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<1, (4, 6, 7)>
<4, (6, 7, 8)>
<6, (7, 8, 9)>

Count of 3-stars: [6]
