Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star-like pattern.

From the adjacency list, we can see that the nodes with exactly three connections are node 1, node 2, node 5, and node 7. Let's find the 3-stars involving these nodes:

1. Nodes connected to node 1 and form a 3-star:
<1, (4, 5, 7)>
<1, (4, 7, 8)>

2. Nodes connected to node 2 and form a 3-star:
<2, (0, 5, 7)>
<2, (0, 7, 8)>

3. Nodes connected to node 5 and form a 3-star:
<5, (1, 2, 7)>
<5, (1, 7, 8)>

4. Nodes connected to node 7 and form a 3-star:
<7, (1, 2, 5)>
<7, (1, 5, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is: [8]
