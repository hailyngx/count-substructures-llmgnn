Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, and node 8

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

There are a total of 10 nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

For a 3-star, we need a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's examine each node to find the 3-stars:

1. Node 0: Connected to nodes 5 and 8 (Not a 3-star).
2. Node 1: Connected to nodes 2, 3, and 6 (3-star: <1, (2, 3, 6)>).
3. Node 2: Connected to nodes 1, 6, and 8 (3-star: <2, (1, 6, 8)>).
4. Node 3: Connected to nodes 1, 5, 6, and 7 (Not a 3-star).
5. Node 4: Connected to node 6 (Not a 3-star).
6. Node 5: Connected to nodes 0, 3, 8, and 9 (Not a 3-star).
7. Node 6: Connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, and 9 (3-stars: <6, (1, 2, 8)>, <6, (1, 3, 9)>, <6, (2, 3, 8)>).
8. Node 7: Connected to nodes 2, 3, and 8 (Not a 3-star).
9. Node 8: Connected to nodes 0, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 9 (3-stars: <8, (0, 2, 5)>, <8, (0, 2, 6)>, <8, (0, 2, 9)>, <8, (0, 5, 9)>, <8, (2, 5, 9)>, <8, (6, 9, 0)>).
10. Node 9: Connected to nodes 3, 5, 6, and 8 (Not a 3-star).

Count of 3-stars: [8]
Unique 3-stars: <<1, (2, 3, 6)>, <2, (1, 6, 8)>, <6, (1, 2, 8)>, <6, (1, 3, 9)>, <6, (2, 3, 8)>, <8, (0, 2, 5)>, <8, (0, 2, 6)>, <8, (0, 2, 9)>, <8, (0, 5, 9)>, <8, (2, 5, 9)>, <8, (6, 9, 0)>]
