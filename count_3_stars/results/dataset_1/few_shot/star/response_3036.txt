Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes (forming a 3-star pattern).

Analyzing the given graph:
- Node 1 is connected to 6 nodes (2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), forming three 3-star patterns: <1, (2, 4, 5)>, <1, (6, 7, 8)>, <1, (4, 7, 8)>
- Node 4 is connected to 6 nodes (0, 1, 3, 7, 8, 9), forming three 3-star patterns: <4, (0, 1, 9)>, <4, (3, 7, 8)>, <4, (1, 7, 8)>
- Node 5 is connected to 3 nodes (1, 7, 8), forming one 3-star pattern: <5, (1, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].


<List of 3-stars>:
<1, (2, 4, 5)>
<1, (6, 7, 8)>
<1, (4, 7, 8)>
<4, (0, 1, 9)>
<4, (3, 7, 8)>
<4, (1, 7, 8)>
<5, (1, 7, 8)>
