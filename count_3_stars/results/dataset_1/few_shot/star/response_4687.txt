Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 6

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the graph can be calculated by finding all the unique 3-stars present. 

Let's list down all the unique 3-stars:

<0, (7, 8, 9)>
<2, (1, 3, 8)>
<2, (1, 3, 9)>
<2, (3, 6, 8)>
<2, (3, 6, 9)>
<2, (8, 9, 0)>
<3, (2, 6, 9)>
<5, (6, 7, 8)>
<9, (0, 2, 6)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we get a total of [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
