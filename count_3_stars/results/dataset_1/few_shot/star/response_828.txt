Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all occurrences of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through each node and its connections to find the 3-stars.

In this graph, the possible 3-stars are as follows:
<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<1, (0, 6, 9)>
<2, (0, 3, 7)>
<5, (0, 7, 9)>

Count of 3-stars: [4]
<count, (neighbors)>
