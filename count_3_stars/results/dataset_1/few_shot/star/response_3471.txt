Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 9
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 5, and node 7

Response:
To find the 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node and its three connected nodes in each 3-star configuration. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars:
<0, (6, 8, 9)>
<1, (4, 7, 9)>
<4, (1, 7, 9)>
<7, (4, 8, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 7)>

Count of 3-stars: [5]
