Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first identify all the 3-stars present in the graph. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Identifying the 3-stars:
- <0, (2, 4, 9)> (center node: 0, leaves: 2, 4, 9)
- <5, (1, 7, 9)> (center node: 5, leaves: 1, 7, 9)
- <6, (4, 7, 9)> (center node: 6, leaves: 4, 7, 9)

Count of 3-stars: [3]
