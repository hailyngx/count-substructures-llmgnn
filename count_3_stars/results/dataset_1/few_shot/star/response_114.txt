Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 10 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 7) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the 3-stars by finding the central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we can see that nodes 1, 3, and 8 are the potential central nodes since they are connected to exactly three other nodes each. Let's check if they form 3-stars:

1. Node 1: Connected to nodes 3 and 8. However, it does not have any edge connecting nodes 3 and 8 directly, so node 1 does not form a 3-star.

2. Node 3: Connected to nodes 1 and 8. Similarly, there is no direct edge between nodes 1 and 8, so node 3 also does not form a 3-star.

3. Node 8: Connected to nodes 1 and 3. This time, there is an edge between nodes 1 and 3, which means that node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 1 and 3.

Therefore, there is only one 3-star in the given graph, which is centered at node 8 with nodes 1 and 3 as the leaves.

The number of 3-stars in the graph is [1].
Unique 3-stars found: <8, (1, 3)>
