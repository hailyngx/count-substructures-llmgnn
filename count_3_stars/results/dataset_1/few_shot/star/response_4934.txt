Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 6
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 6

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph by finding nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Based on the given adjacency list, the 3-stars in the graph can be described as follows:
<0, (2, 7, 8)>
<1, (6, 7, 3)>
<2, (0, 4, 9)>
<3, (4, 7, 0)>
<4, (2, 3, 6)>
<6, (1, 4, 9)>
<7, (0, 1, 3)>
<9, (2, 6, 4)>

Count of 3-stars in the graph: [8]
