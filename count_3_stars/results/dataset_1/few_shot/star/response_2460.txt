Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 6
