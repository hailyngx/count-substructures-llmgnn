Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the unique 3-stars in the graph. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars in the graph: 
<0, (2, 6, 7)>
<2, (0, 6, 5)>
<6, (0, 2, 5)>
<8, (3, 4, 9)>

Since there are 4 unique 3-stars in the graph, the final answer is [4].
