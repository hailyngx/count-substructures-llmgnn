Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 4) (3, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges, which form a 3-star pattern with it as the center.

Looking at the graph description provided, the nodes that have exactly three neighbors are:
- Node 0 (neighbors: 1, 3, 8)
- Node 5 (neighbors: 1, 4, 7)

Thus, there are two 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 3, 8)>
<5, (1, 4, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
