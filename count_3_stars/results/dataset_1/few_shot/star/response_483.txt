Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, 7, and node 8

Node 5 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first identify the central node of each 3-star and then check if it is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming edges with them. 

Here are the steps to count the 3-stars in the graph:

1. From the adjacency list, identify the neighbors of each node.
2. For each node, check if it is the center of a 3-star by looking at its neighbors and their connections.
3. Count the number of unique 3-stars found.

Let's start counting the 3-stars: 

1. Node 0:
   - Neighbors: 2, 4, 8, 9
   - <0, (2, 4, 8)>
   - <0, (2, 4, 9)>
   - <0, (2, 8, 9)>
   - <0, (4, 8, 9)>
   [4]

2. Node 1:
   - Neighbors: 3, 6, 7, 8
   - <1, (3, 6, 7)>
   - <1, (3, 6, 8)>
   [2]

3. Node 2:
   - Neighbors: 0
   [No 3-star]

4. Node 3:
   - Neighbors: 1, 4
   [No 3-star]

5. Node 4:
   - Neighbors: 0, 3
   [No 3-star]

6. Node 5:
   - Neighbors: 6, 8, 9
   - <5, (6, 8, 9)>
   [1]

7. Node 6:
   - Neighbors: 1, 5
   [No 3-star]

8. Node 7:
   - Neighbors: 1, 9
   [No 3-star]

9. Node 8:
   - Neighbors: 0, 1, 5
   - <8, (0, 1, 5)>
   [1]

10. Node 9:
   - Neighbors: 0, 5, 7
   - <9, (0, 5, 7)>
   [1]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
