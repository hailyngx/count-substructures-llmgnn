Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the possible 3-stars based on the definition provided. 

Since a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges, we look for nodes in the graph that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Given the adjacency list of each node, we can identify the following 3-stars:
- <0, (6, 7, 9)>
- <1, (4, 9, 6)>
- <2, (4, 1, 3)>
- <3, (4, 5, 6)>
- <4, (1, 2, 3)>
- <5, (3)>
- <6, (7, 3, 4)>
- <7, (0, 9, 6)>
- <8, (4)>
- <9, (1, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9]. 
These are the unique 3-stars: 
<0, (6, 7, 9)>
<1, (4, 9, 6)>
<2, (4, 1, 3)>
<3, (4, 5, 6)>
<4, (1, 2, 3)>
<5, (3)>
<6, (7, 3, 4)>
<7, (0, 9, 6)>
<8, (4)>
<9, (1, 6, 7)>
