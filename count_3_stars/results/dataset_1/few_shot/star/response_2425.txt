Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 8

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

The possible 3-stars in the given graph are as follows:
<1, (2, 4, 7)>
<1, (4, 6, 7)>
<4, (1, 6, 7)>
<7, (1, 6, 4)>

There are a total of [4] 3-stars in the graph.
