Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 7
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node and its three connected nodes for each 3-star configuration.

Looking at the adjacency list, we can identify the 3-stars as follows:

1. <0, (3, 7, 1)>
2. <1, (2, 5, 3)>
3. <2, (1, 3, 6)>
4. <3, (0, 1, 7)>
5. <5, (1, 7, 0)>
6. <6, (2, 9, 7)>
7. <7, (0, 3, 1)>
8. <8, (6, 9, 2)>
9. <9, (2, 6, 8)>

Therefore, there are a total of [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
