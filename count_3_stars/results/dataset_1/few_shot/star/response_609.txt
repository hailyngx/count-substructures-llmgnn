Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 7

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in this graph.
