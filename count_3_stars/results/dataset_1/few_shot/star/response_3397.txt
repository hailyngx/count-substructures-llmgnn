Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are as follows:
<0, (4, 8, 5)>
<2, (1, 6, 7)>
<6, (2, 5, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
