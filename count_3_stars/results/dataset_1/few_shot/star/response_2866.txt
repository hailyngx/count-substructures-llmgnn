Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8)

Node 7 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star in the graph. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's go through each node and identify the 3-stars:

1. Node 0: No 3-stars can be formed with Node 0 as it has 3 neighbors.

2. Node 1: No 3-stars can be formed with Node 1 as it has 2 neighbors.

3. Node 2: No 3-stars can be formed with Node 2 as it has 3 neighbors.

4. Node 3: No 3-stars can be formed with Node 3 as it has 3 neighbors.

5. Node 4: No 3-stars can be formed with Node 4 as it has 3 neighbors.

6. Node 5: <5, (0, 3, 4)> 

7. Node 6: <6, (0, 1, 4)> 

8. Node 7: No 3-stars can be formed with Node 7 as it has 4 neighbors.

9. Node 8: No 3-stars can be formed with Node 8 as it has 3 neighbors.

10. Node 9: No 3-stars can be formed with Node 9 as it has 4 neighbors.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].  
The unique 3-stars found are: <5, (0, 3, 4)> and <6, (0, 1, 4)>.
