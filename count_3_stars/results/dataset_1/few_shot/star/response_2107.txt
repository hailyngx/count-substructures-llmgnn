Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the 3-stars. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list down all the 3-stars present in the graph:

<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<2, (1, 5, 7)>
<4, (0, 1, 3)>
<5, (2, 7, -)>
<7, (2, 5, -)>

Count of 3-stars in the graph: [4]
