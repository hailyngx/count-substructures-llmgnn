Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 4, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<5, (0, 1, 4)>
<2, (0, 5, 7)>
