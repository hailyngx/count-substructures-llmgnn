Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern.

Looking at the adjacency list and the edges provided, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (5, 7, 9)>
<3, (1, 4, 7)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
