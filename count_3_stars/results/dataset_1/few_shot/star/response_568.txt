Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern.

Identifying 3-stars in the graph:
1. Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 2, and 5. This is the only 3-star with node 0 as the center. <0, (1, 2, 5)>
2. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 4, and 6. This is the only 3-star with node 1 as the center. <1, (0, 4, 6)>
3. Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 4, and 8. This is the only 3-star with node 6 as the center. <6, (1, 4, 8)>
4. Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 6, and 7. This is the only 3-star with node 8 as the center. <8, (4, 6, 7)>
5. Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 7, and 9. This is the only 3-star with node 8 as the center. <8, (6, 7, 9)>
6. Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 6, and 9. Other than the previous instance, this is another 3-star with node 8 as the center. <8, (4, 6, 9)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
