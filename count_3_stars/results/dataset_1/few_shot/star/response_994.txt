Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list the 3-stars in the graph.

In this graph of 10 nodes, the 3-star configurations are as follows:
<0, (2, 5, 6)>
<0, (2, 6, 7)>
<0, (5, 6, 7)>
<2, (0, 6, 9)>
<2, (6, 8, 9)>
<5, (0, 8, 9)>
<6, (0, 2, 4)>
<6, (0, 4, 9)>
<6, (1, 2, 9)>
<6, (4, 8, 9)>
<7, (0, 8, 9)>
<8, (2, 3, 4)>
<8, (2, 4, 7)>
<8, (3, 4, 5)>
<8, (4, 5, 7)>
<9, (2, 6, 7)>
<9, (5, 6, 7)>
