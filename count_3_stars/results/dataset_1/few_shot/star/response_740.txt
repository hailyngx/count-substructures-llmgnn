Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 3

Response:
We can identify the 3-star structures by looking for nodes that have exactly three neighbors. Let's identify them step-by-step:

1. Nodes with 3 neighbors: 
   - Node 1 has neighbors 2, 3, 6, and 8.
   - Node 2 has neighbors 1 and 8.
   - Node 3 has neighbors 1 and 9.
   - Node 5 has neighbors 6 and 8.
   - Node 6 has neighbors 1, 5, 7, and 8.
   - Node 8 has neighbors 1, 2, 5, and 6.
   
2. Possible 3-star centers: 
   - The nodes that have exactly three neighbors can potentially be the centers of 3-stars. 
   
3. Counting 3-stars: 
   - Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph. Please note that we will consider each unique 3-star only once.
