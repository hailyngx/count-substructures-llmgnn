Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star. Let's go through each node and identify these 3-stars:

1. Node 0: Not a part of any 3-star.
2. Node 1: Not a part of any 3-star.
3. Node 2: Not a part of any 3-star.
4. Node 3: Not a part of any 3-star.
5. Node 4: <4, (0, 6, 7)>
6. Node 5: Not a part of any 3-star.
7. Node 6: <6, (1, 3, 4)>, <6, (1, 5, 7)>, <6, (1, 8, 9)>, <6, (3, 4, 7)>, <6, (3, 5, 7)>, <6, (3, 8, 9)>, <6, (4, 5, 7)>, <6, (4, 8, 9)>, <6, (5, 8, 9)>
8. Node 7: Not a part of any 3-star.
9. Node 8: Not a part of any 3-star.
10. Node 9: Not a part of any 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9]. 
Here are the unique 3-stars:
<4, (0, 6, 7)>
<6, (1, 3, 4)>
<6, (1, 5, 7)>
<6, (1, 8, 9)>
<6, (3, 4, 7)>
<6, (3, 5, 7)>
<6, (3, 8, 9)>
<6, (4, 5, 7)>
<6, (4, 8, 9)>
<6, (5, 8, 9)>
