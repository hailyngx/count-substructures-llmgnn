Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 9) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 9
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 6, and node 7

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. For Node 0:
- Node 0 is connected to Node 3 and Node 6. So, <0, (3, 6)> is a 3-star.

2. For Node 1:
- Node 1 is connected to Node 3 and Node 9. So, <1, (3, 9)> is a 3-star.

3. For Node 2:
- Node 2 is connected to Node 6 and Node 9. So, <2, (6, 9)> is a 3-star.

4. For Node 3:
- Node 3 is connected to Node 0 and Node 1. So, <3, (0, 1)> is a 3-star.

5. For Node 6:
- Node 6 is connected to Node 0, Node 2, and Node 9. So, <6, (0, 2, 9)> is a 3-star.

6. For Node 9:
- Node 9 is connected to Node 1, Node 2, and Node 3. So, <9, (1, 2, 3)> is a 3-star.

Count of 3-stars: [6]
Unique 3-stars: <0, (3, 6)>, <1, (3, 9)>, <2, (6, 9)>, <3, (0, 1)>, <6, (0, 2, 9)>, <9, (1, 2, 3)>
