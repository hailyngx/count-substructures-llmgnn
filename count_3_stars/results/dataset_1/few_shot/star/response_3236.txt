Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 5
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5

Response:
The 3-star structures in this graph are: 
<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<1, (0, 2, 6)>
<2, (0, 1, 5)>
<4, (2, 5, 8)>
<5, (0, 2, 4)>
<8, (4, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
