Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 6, and node 8

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- Node 0 forms a 3-star <0, (4, 8)>.
- Node 1 forms a 3-star <1, (2, 4, 6)>.
- Node 2 forms a 3-star <2, (1, 5, 6)>.
- Node 3 does not form a 3-star as it is only connected to two other nodes.
- Node 4 forms two 3-stars: <4, (0, 1, 6)> and <4, (3, 7, 8)>.
- Node 5 does not form a 3-star as it is only connected to one other node.
- Node 6 forms two 3-stars: <6, (1, 2, 4)> and <6, (3, 4, 9)>.
- Node 7 does not form a 3-star as it is only connected to two other nodes.
- Node 8 forms a 3-star <8, (0, 4, 9)>.
- Node 9 does not form a 3-star as it is only connected to two other nodes.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
