Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 6, and node 8

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the graph. The central nodes in a 3-star graph have degree 3. From the adjacency list, we can see that nodes 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 have degree 4 (which means they are not central nodes) while nodes 1, 7, 8, and 9 have degree 2 (which means they are not central nodes either).

Next, let's find the 3-stars. Since the central nodes are nodes 1, 7, 8, and 9, we need to look at their connections to find the 3-stars.

For node 1:
- Node 1 is connected to node 7. Therefore, the 3-star centered at node 1 is <1, (7, x, x)>, where x represents nodes not connected to node 1.

For node 7:
- Node 7 is connected to node 1 and node 4. Therefore, the 3-stars centered at node 7 are <7, (1, x, x)> and <7, (4, x, x)>.

For node 8:
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 9. Therefore, the 3-star centered at node 8 is <8, (3, 5, 9)>.

For node 9:
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 6 and 8. Therefore, the 3-star centered at node 9 is <9, (6, 8, x)>.

So, the 3-stars in the given graph are <1, (7, x, x)>, <7, (1, x, x)>, <7, (4, x, x)>, <8, (3, 5, 9)>, and <9, (6, 8, x)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
