Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 5) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 5
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the possible 3-stars.

Let's list all the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (5, 1, 7)>
<0, (5, 1, 8)>
<0, (5, 7, 8)>
<0, (5, 8, 1)>

<1, (5, 0, 7)>
<1, (5, 0, 8)>
<1, (5, 7, 0)>
<1, (5, 8, 0)>

<3, (9, 6, 5)>
<3, (9, 5, 6)>
<3, (6, 5, 9)>

<4, (8, 7, 5)>
<4, (8, 5, 7)>
<4, (7, 5, 8)>

<6, (9, 3, 5)>
<6, (9, 5, 3)>
<6, (3, 5, 9)>

<7, (5, 0, 8)>
<7, (5, 8, 0)>

<8, (5, 0, 7)>
<8, (5, 7, 0)>

[There are 19 unique 3-stars in the given graph.]
