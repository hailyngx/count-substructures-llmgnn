Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 8

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 3 as leaves: <0, (1, 3)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 3 as leaves: <1, (0, 3)>
- Node 3 forms two 3-stars:
  - <3, (0, 1, 7)>
  - <3, (6, 7, 9)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 7 as leaves: <6, (3, 7)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 5 as leaves: <7, (3, 5)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 7 as leaves: <9, (6, 7)>

There are total of [6] 3-stars in this graph.
