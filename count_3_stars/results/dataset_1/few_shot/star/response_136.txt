Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 8

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern.

Given the graph information provided, here are the identified 3-stars:
1. <0, (3, 8)>
2. <3, (0, 4)>
3. <4, (1, 2, 3)>
4. <5, (7, 9)>
5. <6, (2, 8, 9)>
6. <8, (0, 6, 9)>
7. <9, (5, 6, 8)>

There are a total of 7 unique 3-stars in the graph.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
