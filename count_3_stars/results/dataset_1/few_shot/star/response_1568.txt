Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 7

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 0: <0, (3, 5, 6)>, <0, (3, 5, 9)>
2. Node 1: <1, (7, 8, 9)>
3. Node 7: <7, (1, 8, 9)>
4. Node 8: <8, (1, 7, 9)>
 
These are all the unique 3-stars in the graph. 
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
