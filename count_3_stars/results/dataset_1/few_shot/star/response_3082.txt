Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will be the centers of 3-stars in the graph.

From the adjacency list provided, the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes are:
- Node 1 (connected to 6, 8, and 9)
- Node 3 (connected to 7, 5, and 8)

Now, let's list all the unique 3-stars in the graph:
<1, (6, 8, 9)>
<3, (7, 5, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
