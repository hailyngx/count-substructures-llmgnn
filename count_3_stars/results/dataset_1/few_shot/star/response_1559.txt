Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a star structure.

Looking at the adjacency list provided for each node, we can identify the following 3-stars:

<0, (3, 4, 8)>
<1, (3, 6, 8)>
<2, (3, 4, 0)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<4, (0, 2, 3)>
<6, (1, 4, 9)>
<8, (0, 1, 5)>
<9, (3, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
