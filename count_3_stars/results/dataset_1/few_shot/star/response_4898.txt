Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 4) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 9) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's analyze the graph:

- Node 0 is connected to 4 nodes (6, 7, 8, 9).
- Node 1 is connected to 2 nodes (7).
- Node 2 is connected to 1 node (4).
- Node 3 is connected to 1 node (8).
- Node 4 is connected to 2 nodes (2, 9).
- Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
- Node 6 is connected to 1 node (0).
- Node 7 is connected to 2 nodes (0, 1).
- Node 8 is connected to 3 nodes (0, 3, 9).
- Node 9 is connected to 3 nodes (0, 4, 8).

From the analysis, we can see that nodes 8 and 9 are both connected to exactly three nodes, forming 3-stars. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 2.

Unique 3-stars found: 
<8, (0, 3, 9)>
<9, (0, 4, 8)>
