Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star-like pattern. Let's identify these 3-stars step by step:

1. Nodes 0, 2, and 4 do not form any 3-stars since they are not connected to exactly three other nodes.

2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 6. This forms one 3-star:
    <1, (2, 3, 6)>

3. Nodes 3 and 7 do not form any 3-stars since they are connected to only two other nodes each.

4. We do not have any other nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

Now, we can count the total number of 3-stars in the graph: [1].
