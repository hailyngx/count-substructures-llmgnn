Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 4

Response:
The given graph does contain 3-stars. Let's find them step by step.

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 9:
   - <0, (2, 5, 9)>

2. Node 3 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 7, and 8:
   - <3, (5, 6, 7)>
   - <3, (5, 7, 8)>
   - <3, (6, 7, 8)>

3. Node 6 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 7:
   - <6, (3, 4, 7)>
   
4. Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 6, and 8:
   - <7, (1, 3, 6)>
   - <7, (1, 3, 8)>
   - <7, (1, 6, 8)>
   - <7, (3, 6, 8)>

Overall, there are [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
