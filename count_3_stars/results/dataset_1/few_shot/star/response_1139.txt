Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 10 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (2, 6) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 6
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 6
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
The 3-star graph consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. In this case, we need to identify all possible 3-stars in the given graph.

Let's go through the nodes and their connections:

- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 5, 7.
- Node 2 does not form a 3-star as it has only one connection.
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 5, 7.
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 7, 1.
- Node 6 does not form a 3-star as it has two connections.
- Node 8 does not form a 3-star as it has one connection.
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 4, 5.

Hence, the unique 3-stars in the graph are: 
<1, (4, 5, 7)>
<4, (1, 5, 7)>
<5, (4, 7, 1)>
