Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 4

Response:
Given the edge list:
(0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 4)

We can identify the 3-stars in the graph by finding nodes that are connected to exactly 3 other nodes. Let's list them:

<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<1, (2, 7, 5)>
<2, (1)>
<4, (0, 9)>
<5, (0, 7)>
<6, (0, 8)>
<7, (1, 5)>
<8, (0, 6)>
<9, (4)>

By counting the number of unique 3-stars found, we get a total of [9].
