Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the possible combinations where a node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes in a star pattern.

The nodes that can act as centers of a 3-star in this graph are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 7, and 9.

Let's go through each of these potential center nodes:

- For node 0: (0, 7, 8)
- For node 1: (1, 2, 3) and (1, 8, 9)
- For node 2: (2, 1, 3) and (2, 6, 7)
- For node 3: (3, 0, 1) and (3, 2, 6)
- For node 7: (7, 0, 2) and (7, 9, 1)
- For node 9: (9, 1, 4) and (9, 5, 7)

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are: <0, (7, 8, 3)>, <1, (2, 3, 8)>, <1, (8, 9, 1)>, <2, (6, 7, 1)>, <3, (2, 6, 7)>, <7, (9, 1, 7)>, and <9, (5, 4, 1)>.

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
