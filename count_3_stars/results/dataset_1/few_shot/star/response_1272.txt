Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 7
