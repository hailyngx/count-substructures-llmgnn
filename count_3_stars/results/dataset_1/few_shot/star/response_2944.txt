Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 6
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star present. A 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes. Looking at the adjacency list and the edges provided, we can identify the 3-stars based on this definition.

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the given graph:
<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<0, (3, 5, 9)>
<0, (3, 6, 9)>
<0, (5, 6, 8)>
<0, (5, 6, 9)>
<0, (5, 8, 9)>
<0, (6, 8, 9)>
<5, (0, 3, 9)>
<5, (3, 6, 8)>
<5, (8, 6, 9)>
<8, (1, 5, 9)>
<8, (5, 6, 9)>
<8, (6, 0, 9)>
<8, (6, 5, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
