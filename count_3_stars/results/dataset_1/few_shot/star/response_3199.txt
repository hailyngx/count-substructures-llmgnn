Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first identify the nodes that can act as centers of the 3-stars. These nodes must have exactly three neighbors.

From the adjacency list, we see that nodes 0, 3, 4, 7, and 9 have exactly three neighbors. So these nodes can potentially be the centers of 3-stars.

Let's examine each of these nodes:

1. Node 0: <0, (1, 3, 8)>
2. Node 3: <3, (0, 4, 6)> and <3, (0, 4, 9)>
3. Node 4: <4, (3, 6, 9)>
4. Node 7: <7, (6, 8, 9)> and <7, (8, 9, 3)>
5. Node 9: <9, (3, 4, 5)> and <9, (3, 5, 7)> and <9, (4, 5, 7)>

There are a total of 8 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
So, the final answer is [8].
