Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the adjacency list for each node, we can identify the following 3-star configurations:

<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<0, (1, 8, 3)>
<4, (0, 6, 9)>
<4, (0, 6, 9)>
<6, (2, 4, 7)>
<8, (0, 3, 9)>
<8, (0, 3, 9)>

Counting the unique 3-stars found above, we get a total of [4] 3-stars in the given graph.
