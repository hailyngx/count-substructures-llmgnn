Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's first list them:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 5.

Now, let's find all the 3-stars in the graph:
1. <1, (2, 3, 8)>
2. <8, (1, 2, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
