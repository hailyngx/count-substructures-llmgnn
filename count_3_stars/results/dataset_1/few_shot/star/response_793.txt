Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 7

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, creating a 3-star pattern. Let's list the 3-stars present in the graph:

<0, (5, 6, 8)>
<2, (1, 5, 7)>
<5, (0, 2, 6)>
<7, (2, 3, 4)>
<7, (2, 8, 9)>
<7, (3, 4, 9)>
<7, (4, 8, 9)>
<9, (3, 5, 7)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we get a total of [8] 3-stars in the graph.
