Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we first need to identify all the instances where there is a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through the nodes one by one:

- Node 0: This node is not a central node of a 3-star as it is connected to only 2 other nodes.
- Node 1: This node forms one 3-star with neighbors 2, 3, and 9.
- Node 2: This node is not a central node.
- Node 3: This node forms two 3-stars: one with neighbors 0, 1, and 9, and another with neighbors 4, 5, and 1.
- Node 4: This node is a part of one 3-star with neighbors 3, 5, and 7.
- Node 5: This node is not a central node.
- Node 6: This node does not form a 3-star.
- Node 7: This node is not a central node.
- Node 8: This node forms one 3-star with neighbors 6, 9, and 9.
- Node 9: This node forms two 3-stars: one with neighbors 0, 1, and 6, and another with neighbors 8, 6, and 1.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are:
<1, (2, 3, 9)>
<3, (0, 1, 9)>
<3, (1, 4, 5)>
<4, (3, 5, 7)>
<8, (6, 9, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 6)>

Count of 3-stars: [6]
