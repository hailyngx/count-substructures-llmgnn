Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-star graphs, we need to identify all possible combinations of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's analyze the given graph step by step:

1. From the adjacency list, we see that the nodes connected to three other nodes are 0, 6, and 7. This means that the potential central nodes for 3-star graphs are 0, 6, and 7.

2. Now, let's identify the leaf nodes connected to each potential central node:
   - Node 0: Nodes 3, 4, and 6
   - Node 6: Nodes 0, 4, and 7
   - Node 7: Nodes 6 and 8

3. Considering the above information, we can build all unique 3-stars in the given graph:
   <0, (3, 4, 6)>
   <0, (3, 4, 6)>
   <0, (4, 3, 6)>
   <6, (0, 4, 7)>
   <6, (0, 4, 7)>
   <6, (4, 0, 7)>

4. Finally, we count the total number of unique 3-star graphs, which is [4].
