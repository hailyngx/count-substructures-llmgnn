Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will be the centers of the 3-stars. Let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

1. From the adjacency list:
- Node 0 is connected to 6, 7, and 9. This creates a 3-star with center node 0 and leaves 6, 7, and 9. (<0, (6, 7, 9)>)
- Node 2 is connected to 4, 6, and 8. This creates a 3-star with center node 2 and leaves 4, 6, and 8. (<2, (4, 6, 8)>)
- Node 5 is connected to 1, 8, and 9. This creates a 3-star with center node 5 and leaves 1, 8, and 9. (<5, (1, 8, 9)>)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
