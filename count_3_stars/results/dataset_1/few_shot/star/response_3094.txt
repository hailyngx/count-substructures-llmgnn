Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a star shape.

Let's go through the nodes and identify the 3-stars:

1. For Node 0: There are no 3-stars as it is only connected to 2 other nodes.

2. For Node 1: There are no 3-stars as it is only connected to 1 other node.

3. For Node 2: 3-star found: <2, (6, 8, 3)>

4. For Node 3: 3-star found: <3, (8, 7, 9)>

5. For Node 4: There are no 3-stars as it is only connected to 1 other node.

6. For Node 5: There are no 3-stars as it is connected to more than 3 nodes.

7. For Node 6: There are no 3-stars as it is only connected to 2 other nodes.

8. For Node 7: There are no 3-stars as it is connected to more than 3 nodes.

9. For Node 8: 3-star found: <8, (2, 3, 9)>

10. For Node 9: 3-star found: <9, (1, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: <2, (6, 8, 3)>, <3, (8, 7, 9)>, <8, (2, 3, 9)>, <9, (1, 7, 8)>.
