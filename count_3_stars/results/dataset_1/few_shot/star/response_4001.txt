Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's start by listing the unique 3-stars found:

<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<0, (2, 6, 7)>
<1, (2, 6, 7)>
<1, (3, 7, 9)>
<4, (0, 6, 9)>
<6, (0, 1, 5)>
<6, (0, 4, 5)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars by listing them all and then count this list.
