Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list out the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<0, (3, 5, 7)>
<0, (3, 8, 6)>
<0, (3, 8, 7)>
<0, (5, 8, 9)>
<0, (6, 3, 7)>
<0, (6, 3, 8)>
<0, (6, 7, 8)>
<3, (0, 2, 6)>
<3, (0, 2, 7)>
<3, (0, 6, 7)>
<8, (0, 1, 4)>
<8, (0, 1, 5)>
<8, (0, 4, 5)>
<9, (1, 4, 5)>

Therefore, there are a total of [14] 3-stars in the graph.
