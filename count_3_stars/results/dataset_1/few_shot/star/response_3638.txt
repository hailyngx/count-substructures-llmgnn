Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the graph. Since a 3-star has a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we need to find nodes with degree 3. From the adjacency list, we see that nodes 1, 2, and 6 have degree 3. These are the potential central nodes for 3-stars.

Next, let's find the 3-stars in the graph:
- For node 1: (1, 2, 3), (1, 2, 6)
- For node 2: (2, 0, 1), (2, 0, 3), (2, 1, 6), (2, 1, 8)
- For node 6: (6, 1, 2), (6, 1, 8), (6, 2, 4), (6, 2, 7), (6, 2, 8)

Now, count the total number of unique 3-stars: [8]
List of unique 3-stars:
<1, (2, 3, 6)>
<1, (2, 6, 0)>
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<2, (1, 6, 8)>
<6, (1, 2, 8)>
<6, (1, 8, 2)>
<6, (2, 4, 7)>
<6, (2, 7, 8)>
