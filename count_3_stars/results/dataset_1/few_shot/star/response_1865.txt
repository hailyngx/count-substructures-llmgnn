Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each central node (center) and count the number of 3-stars centered around it. 

Let's go through each node to identify the 3-stars:

- Node 0: <0, (2, 8, 0)>
- Node 1: No 3-star centered around node 1
- Node 2: <2, (0, 6, 7)>
- Node 3: No 3-star centered around node 3
- Node 4: No 3-star centered around node 4
- Node 5: No 3-star centered around node 5
- Node 6: No 3-star centered around node 6
- Node 7: <7, (2, 6, 8)>
- Node 8: <8, (0, 4, 7)>
- Node 9: <9, (3, 4, 5)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4]. 

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (2, 8, 0)>
<2, (0, 6, 7)>
<7, (2, 6, 8)>
<8, (0, 4, 7)>
