Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 8

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- The possible central nodes are nodes 1, 2, 5, 8, and 9 as they have exactly 3 neighbors.
- We will then check each of these nodes to see if they form a 3-star.
  
Checking node 1:
Node 1: (2, 6, 9)
<1, (2, 6, 9)>

Checking node 2:
Node 2: (1, 8, 9)
<2, (1, 8, 9)>

Checking node 5:
Node 5: (4, 6, 7)
<5, (4, 6, 7)>

Checking node 8:
Node 8: (2, 3, 9)
<8, (2, 3, 9)>

Checking node 9:
Node 9: (1, 2, 8)
<9, (1, 2, 8)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
