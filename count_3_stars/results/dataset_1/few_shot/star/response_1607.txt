Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 7) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star pattern in the graph. 

From the information provided, the nodes and their connections are as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 9
- Node 1 is connected to node 8
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 5
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 8
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0 and 3
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2 and 7
- Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 5 and 8
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 7
- Node 9 is connected to node 0

Let's find the 3-stars in the graph by identifying the central node and its connected leaves. 

There, [the number of 3-stars in the graph is equal to 4]. 

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (2, 4, 9)>
<2, (0, 3, 5)>
<3, (2, 4, 8)>
<5, (2, 7, 8)>
