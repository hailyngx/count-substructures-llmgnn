Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, and node 7

Response:
First, let's find all the 3-stars in the given graph. 
To do this, we need to identify nodes that are connected to exactly 3 other nodes. 

In this case, the nodes that meet this criteria are 0, 2, 4, 6, 7, and 9. Let's examine each of these nodes to find the 3-stars:

- Node 0: <0, (3, 4, 6)>, <0, (3, 6, 9)>, <0, (4, 6, 7)>, <0, (6, 7, 9)>, <0, (4, 6, 9)>
- Node 2: <2, (4, 6, 7)>
- Node 4: No 3-star as its connections do not form a 3-star pattern.
- Node 6: <6, (0, 4, 9)>, <6, (4, 7, 9)>, <6, (0, 1, 4)>
- Node 7: <7, (0, 9, 2)>
- Node 9: <9, (0, 3, 6)>, <9, (3, 6, 7)>, <9, (0, 6, 7)>

Combining all the unique 3-stars identified, we get: 
<0, (3, 4, 6)>, <0, (3, 6, 9)>, <0, (4, 6, 7)>, <0, (6, 7, 9)>, <0, (4, 6, 9)>, <2, (4, 6, 7)>, <6, (0, 4, 9)>, <6, (4, 7, 9)>, <6, (0, 1, 4)>, <7, (0, 9, 2)>, <9, (0, 3, 6)>, <9, (3, 6, 7)>, <9, (0, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [13].
