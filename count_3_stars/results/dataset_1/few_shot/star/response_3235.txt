Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star-like fashion.

Starting from the given adjacency list, we can identify the 3-star patterns as follows:

<Node 0, (1, 7, 9)>
<Node 1, (0, 7, 9)>
<Node 5, (2, 3, 4)>
<Node 6, (5, 9, 0)>
<Node 7, (0, 1, 8)>
<Node 8, (5, 7, 9)>
<Node 9, (0, 1, 6)>

Count = 6

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
