Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list them below:

- Node 2: (1, 5, 6), (1, 6, 7), (1, 6, 8), (1, 6, 9), (5, 6, 7), (5, 6, 8), (5, 6, 9), (6, 7, 8), (6, 7, 9), (6, 8, 9)
- Node 8: (2, 3, 5), (2, 3, 7), (2, 5, 8), (2, 7, 8), (3, 5, 7), (3, 5, 8), (3, 7, 8)
- Node 9: (2, 3, 7)

Therefore, there are a total of [14] 3-stars in the given graph.
