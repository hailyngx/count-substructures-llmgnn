Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three neighbors, forming a 3-star pattern. 

The central node of the 3-star will be the node with three neighbors. Let's identify these nodes and the corresponding 3-stars:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: Node 2, 5, 8
  <0, (2, 5, 8)>
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: Node 2, 4, 5
  <3, (2, 4, 5)>
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: Node 1, 6, 8
  <4, (1, 6, 8)>
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: Node 1, 3, 5
  <6, (1, 3, 5)>

Therefore, there are a total of [4] 3-stars in the given graph.
