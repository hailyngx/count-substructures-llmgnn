Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern in the graph.

Let's analyze the graph to find the 3-stars.

From the given information, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (2, 8, 1)>
<2, (0, 8, 1)>
<2, (5, 4, 8)>
<3, (2, 6, 9)>
<4, (5, 8, 2)>
<5, (1, 4, 2)>
<6, (1, 3, 9)>
<7, (2, 9, 0)>
<8, (1, 4, 2)>
<9, (3, 7, 6)>

There are [9] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
