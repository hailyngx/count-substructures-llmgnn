Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star configuration.

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (5, 7)>
<1, (2, 7, 9)>
<2, (1, 4, 7)>
<3, (4, 7, 8)>
<4, (2, 3, 6)>
<5, (0, 9)>
<7, (0, 1, 2)>
<9, (1, 5, 7)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars in the graph, we find that there are [8] 3-stars in total.
