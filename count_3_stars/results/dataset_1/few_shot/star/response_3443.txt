Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 8

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them. These nodes will be the potential centers of 3-stars.   
Nodes with 3 edges: 1, 4, and 7

Next, we will examine each of these potential center nodes and check if they form a 3-star with three other nodes.   
For Node 1: 
- (1, 0, 4) forms a 3-star
- (1, 2, 7) forms a 3-star
- (1, 4, 6) forms a 3-star

For Node 4: 
- (4, 1, 3) forms a 3-star

For Node 7: 
- (7, 1, 2) forms a 3-star
- (7, 3, 5) forms a 3-star

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found are <1, (0, 4, 6)>, <4, (1, 3)>, <7, (1, 2)>, and <7, (3, 5)>.

Calculating the final answer, we find that there are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.
