Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 5

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 

Starting from each node, we check if there are exactly three edges connected to that node. If so, we form a 3-star with that node being the center and the nodes connected to it being the leaves. 

Let's list out the 3-stars we find:

<0, (7, 9)>
<1, (5, 6)>
<2, (6, 7)>
<5, (1, 4, 9)>
<7, (0, 2, 8)>
<8, (3, 7)>

Now, count the number of unique 3-stars in the graph. 

So, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
