Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 8

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 

1. From the adjacency list, we can identify the possible 3-stars based on the definition of a 3-star graph.
2. A 3-star has a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:

<1, (3, 9, 5)>
<2, (3, 6, 8)>
<3, (1, 2, 8)>
<4, (0, 6, N/A)>
<6, (2, 4, N/A)>
<9, (1, 5, 8)>

Count of 3-star graphs: [6]
