Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 6

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

From the adjacency list, we can see that there are three 3-stars in this graph:
<0, (1, 2, 6)>
<1, (0, 2, 8)>
<2, (0, 1, 6)>

Therefore, there are 3 3-stars in the given graph.  
So the final answer is [3].
