Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 6

Response:
The 3-star graphs can be identified by looking for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list the unique 3-stars in this graph:

<2, (0, 1, 6)>
<3, (5, 6, 9)>
<6, (2, 3, 8)>
<9, (1, 3, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
