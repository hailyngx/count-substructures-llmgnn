Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 8

Response:
The 3-star graph consists of a center node connected to three other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (2, 5, 8)>
<2, (0, 5, 8)>
<3, (0, 6, 8)>
<5, (0, 1, 9)>
<8, (0, 2, 9)>
