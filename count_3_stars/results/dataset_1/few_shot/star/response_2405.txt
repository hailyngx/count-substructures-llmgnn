Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we first identify the central node and its adjacent nodes for each potential 3-star in the graph. 
Based on the given adjacency list, we can see that the possible 3-stars can be formed around nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, 8, and 9 since these nodes have at least 3 neighbors. 

Now, let's list down the unique 3-stars: 
<0, (1, 4, 8)>
<1, (0, 4, 8)>
<3, (0, 4, 9)>
<4, (0, 1, 8)>
<8, (0, 1, 4)>
<9, (3, 6, 8)>

To find the total count of 3-stars, we count the number of unique 3-stars we found. 
So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
