Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 8

Response:
Starting from each node, let's find the number of 3-stars and then sum them up to get the total count.
Let's go through each node:

For Node 0: 
- There are 3 neighbors: 5, 6, and 8
- Number of 3-stars containing Node 0 as the center: 0

For Node 1:
- There are 5 neighbors: 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9
- Number of 3-stars containing Node 1 as the center: 2
    - <1, (4, 8, 9)>
    - <1, (5, 7, 9)>

For Node 2:
- There are 3 neighbors: 3, 5, and 9
- Number of 3-stars containing Node 2 as the center: 0

For Node 3:
- There are 4 neighbors: 2, 4, 6, and 8
- Number of 3-stars containing Node 3 as the center: 1
    - <3, (2, 4, 8)>

For Node 4:
- There are 3 neighbors: 1, 3, and 8
- Number of 3-stars containing Node 4 as the center: 0

For Node 5:
- There are 5 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 7, and 9
- Number of 3-stars containing Node 5 as the center: 2
    - <5, (0, 2, 9)>
    - <5, (1, 7, 9)>

For Node 6:
- There are 2 neighbors: 0 and 3
- Number of 3-stars containing Node 6 as the center: 0

For Node 7:
- There are 2 neighbors: 1 and 5
- Number of 3-stars containing Node 7 as the center: 0

For Node 8:
- There are 5 neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 4, and 9
- Number of 3-stars containing Node 8 as the center: 2
    - <8, (0, 3, 4)>
    - <8, (1, 4, 9)>

For Node 9:
- There are 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 5, and 8
- Number of 3-stars containing Node 9 as the center: 1
    - <9, (1, 5, 8)>

Total number of 3-stars in the given graph: [6]
<1, (4, 8, 9)>
<1, (5, 7, 9)>
<3, (2, 4, 8)>
<5, (0, 2, 9)>
<5, (1, 7, 9)>
<8, (0, 3, 4)>
