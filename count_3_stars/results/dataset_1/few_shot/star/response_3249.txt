Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star configuration in the graph. 

Let's list the unique 3-star configurations <center, (leaf1, leaf2, leaf3)>:

<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<0, (2, 3, 9)>
<0, (3, 4, 9)>
<1, (3, 5, 8)>
<2, (0, 6, 7)>
<3, (1, 5, 7)>
<6, (2, 4, 7)>
<7, (8, 9, 0)>

Counting the total number of unique 3-stars, we find that there are [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
