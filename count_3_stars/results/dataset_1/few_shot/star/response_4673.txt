Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 6, and node 9
