Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars, we need to identify each unique 3-star in the graph. 

First, let's list the 3-stars that can be formed using the given graph:
<0, (3, 6, 7)>
<0, (3, 7, 9)>
<1, (4, 9, 0)>
<2, (3, 4, 5)>
<3, (0, 2, 5)>
<3, (0, 5, 7)>
<3, (2, 4, 5)>
<4, (1, 2, 9)>
<4, (1, 9, 0)>
<5, (2, 3, 0)>
<7, (0, 3, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 4)>

Counting the unique 3-stars above, we find there are [12] 3-stars in the given graph.
