Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 8

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph by finding all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

After analyzing the provided information, we can find the following 3-stars in the graph: 
<0, (4, 5, 9)>
<1, (6, 8, 0)>
<3, (5, 9, 0)>
<4, (0, 6, 5)>
<5, (0, 3, 9)>
<6, (1, 4, 0)>
<8, (1, 7, 9)>
<9, (0, 3, 8)>

Counting all the unique 3-stars in the graph gives a total of 8. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
