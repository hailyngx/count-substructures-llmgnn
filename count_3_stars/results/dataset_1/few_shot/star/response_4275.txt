Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (9, 1) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 3
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's analyze the graph:

- Node 0: (0, 4, 7), <0, (4, 7)>
- Node 1: (1, 4, 7), (1, 9, 4), <1, (4, 7, 9)>
- Node 2: Not a part of any 3-star
- Node 3: (3, 5, 7), <3, (5, 7)>
- Node 4: (4, 1, 9), (4, 0, 1), <4, (0, 1, 9)>
- Node 5: (5, 2, 3), <5, (2, 3, 6)>
- Node 6: Not a part of any 3-star
- Node 7: (7, 0, 1), (7, 3, 1), <7, (0, 1, 3)>
- Node 8: Not connected to any other nodes
- Node 9: (9, 1, 4), <9, (1, 4)>

Count of 3-stars: [4]
