Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-star subgraphs in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star. 

From the provided information, we can visualize the graph and look for subgraphs where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list the unique 3-star subgraphs found in the graph:

<0, (4, 9, 2)>
<4, (0, 3, 2)>
<9, (0, 3, 7)>
<2, (1, 4, 9)>
<3, (4, 6, 9)>
<7, (5, 6, 9)>
<6, (3, 7, 8)>
<5, (7)>
<8, (6)>

Count of 3-star subgraphs in the given graph: [8]
