Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 4, 7, and node 8

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Upon examining the provided adjacency list, we find the following 3-star configurations:
- <0, (3, 6, 8)>
- <0, (3, 8, 9)>
- <1, (3, 8, 9)>
- <3, (0, 1, 2)>
- <3, (4, 8, 9)>
- <4, (3, 8, 9)>
- <6, (0, 3, 7)>
- <7, (4, 6, 9)>
- <8, (0, 1, 9)>
- <9, (4, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 6, 8)>
<0, (3, 8, 9)>
<1, (3, 8, 9)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<3, (4, 8, 9)>
<4, (3, 8, 9)>
<6, (0, 3, 7)>
<7, (4, 6, 9)>
<8, (0, 1, 9)>
<9, (4, 7, 8)>
