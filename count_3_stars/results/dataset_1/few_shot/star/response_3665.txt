Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star configurations in the given graph. 

From the adjacency list, we can see that the possible 3-star configurations are:
<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<2, (0, 6, 8)>
<4, (0, 6, 8)>
<5, (3, 7, 9)>
<6, (2, 4, 8)>
<7, (1, 2, 3)>
<8, (0, 2, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
