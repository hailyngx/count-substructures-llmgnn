Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 4, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Looking at the provided edges and adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars in the graph:

<1, (0, 3, 6)>
<1, (3, 6, 9)>
<1, (6, 8, 9)>
<4, (7, 9, 1)>
<4, (9, 7, 8)>
<6, (1, 3, 8)>
<7, (4, 5, 9)>
<7, (5, 4, 9)>
<8, (2, 6, 9)>
<9, (1, 4, 8)>

Count of 3-stars in the given graph: [10].
