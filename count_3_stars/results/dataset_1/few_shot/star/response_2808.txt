Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 8

Response:
First, let's find the nodes that have exactly three neighbors since these are the potential central nodes of the 3-stars.

Nodes with 3 neighbors: 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

<8, (1, 2, 9)>
<8, (1, 2, 6)>
