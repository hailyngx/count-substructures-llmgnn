Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all unique 3-stars. Let's start by listing out the unique 3-stars:

<0, (2, 5, 8)>
<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<2, (0, 1, 8)>
<4, (1, 2, 6)>

Now, we count the total number of unique 3-stars: [4].
