Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 3

Response:
To find the 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that have exactly three neighbors, where one of the neighbors is a common neighbor for the other two. 

Let's list the 3-stars found in the graph:
<2, (3, 6, 7)>
<3, (2, 4, 5)>
<6, (1, 2, 7)>
<7, (3, 6, 8)>
<8, (3, 4, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
