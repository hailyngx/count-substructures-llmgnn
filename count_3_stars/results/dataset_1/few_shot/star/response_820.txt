Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 3

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars, which consist of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Given the adjacency list for each node, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. From the adjacency list, we identify the nodes that have exactly three neighbors. These nodes can potentially be the center of a 3-star.

2. We list out all the 3-stars found in the graph.

3. Finally, we count the total number of unique 3-stars.

Let's start by identifying the 3-stars from the given graph:

Potential 3-star centers:
- Node 1: (1, 3, 6)
- Node 2: (2, 5, 6)
- Node 3: (3, 4, 9)
- Node 4: (4, 5, 8)
- Node 5: (2, 4, 6)
- Node 6: (1, 2, 5)

Unique 3-stars: 
<1, (3, 6)>
<2, (5, 6)>
<3, (4, 9)>
<4, (5, 8)>
<5, (2, 6)>
<6, (1, 5, 2)>

Total number of 3-stars: [5]
