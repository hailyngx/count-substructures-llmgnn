Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we look for all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's analyze the graph to identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 is not part of any 3-star.
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 7, and 9.
- Node 2 is not part of any 3-star.
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 5, and 9.
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, and 9.
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 4, and 9.
- Node 6 is not part of any 3-star.
- Node 7 is not part of any 3-star.
- Node 8 is not part of any 3-star.
- Node 9 is part of 3-stars with nodes 1, 3, and 4, as well as nodes 1, 4, and 5.

Therefore, the final answer is [6] and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (4, 7, 9)>
<3, (4, 5, 9)>
<4, (1, 3, 9)>
<5, (3, 4, 9)>
<9, (1, 3, 4)>
<9, (1, 4, 5)>
