Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we can look for nodes that have exactly three neighbors and form a 3-star configuration around that node. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we can see that nodes 0, 3, and 8 have only three neighbors each, making them potential centers of 3-stars. 

Now, let's list the unique 3-star configurations in the graph:

<0, (4, 1, 9)>
<3, (4, 5, 8)>
<8, (1, 9, 4)>

Count of 3-stars: [3]
