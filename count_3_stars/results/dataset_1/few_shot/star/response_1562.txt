Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will be the centers of the 3-stars.

From the adjacency list, we can see that node 0, node 3, node 5, and node 8 are connected to exactly three other nodes.

So, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are:
<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<3, (0, 5, 6)>
<5, (0, 3, 6)>
<6, (0, 3, 5)>
<8, (0, 2, 4)>

Count of 3-stars: [5]
