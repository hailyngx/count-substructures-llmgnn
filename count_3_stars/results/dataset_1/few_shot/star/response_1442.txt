Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to first identify all the unique 3-stars present.

Looking at the adjacency list, we can identify the following unique 3-stars:
1. <0, (2, 6, 9)>
2. <0, (2, 6, 9)>
3. <2, (0, 1, 5)>
4. <2, (0, 1, 5)>
5. <2, (0, 5, 9)>
6. <2, (0, 5, 9)>
7. <2, (1, 5, 9)>
8. <2, (1, 5, 9)>
9. <5, (1, 2, 7)>
10. <5, (1, 2, 9)>
11. <5, (1, 7, 9)>
12. <5, (2, 7, 9)>
13. <6, (0, 2, 3)>
14. <6, (0, 2, 3)>
15. <7, (3, 5, 9)>
16. <7, (3, 5, 9)>
17. <7, (5, 8, 9)>
18. <7, (5, 8, 9)>
19. <9, (0, 2, 5)>
20. <9, (0, 2, 5)>
21. <9, (2, 5, 7)>
22. <9, (2, 5, 7)>
23. <9, (5, 7, 9)>
24. <9, (5, 7, 9)>

Thus, there are a total of [24] 3-stars in the given graph.
