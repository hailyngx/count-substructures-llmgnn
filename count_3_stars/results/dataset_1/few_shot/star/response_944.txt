Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 6) (9, 0) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 6
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes (forming a 3-star pattern).

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (3, 9, 5)>
<1, (4, 6, 2)>

There are a total of [2] 3-stars in the graph.
