Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 5

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph: 

1. Node 0: (1, 4, 6)
2. Node 1: (0, 4, 6) and (2, 4, 9)
3. Node 2: (1, 4, 9)
4. Node 3: No 3-star
5. Node 4: (0, 1, 6) and (2, 1, 9)
6. Node 5: No 3-star
7. Node 6: (0, 1, 4)
8. Node 7: No 3-star
9. Node 8: No 3-star
10. Node 9: (1, 2, 5)

Therefore, there are a total of [7] 3-stars in the given graph.

<0, (1, 4, 6)>, <1, (0, 4, 6)>, <1, (2, 4, 9)>, <2, (1, 4, 9)>, <4, (0, 1, 6)>, <4, (2, 1, 9)>, <6, (0, 1, 4)>, <9, (1, 2, 5)>
