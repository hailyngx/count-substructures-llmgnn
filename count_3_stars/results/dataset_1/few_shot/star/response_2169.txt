Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 6) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 6
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 6, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each possible 3-star configuration. 

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<0, (4, 6, 9)>
<0, (5, 6, 9)>
<6, (0, 4, 5)>
<6, (0, 5, 9)>
<6, (0, 4, 9)>
<8, (3, 4, 6)>
<8, (3, 6, 9)>
<9, (0, 6, 7)>
<9, (0, 6, 8)>
<9, (7, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [11].
