Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 2) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 5, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify the central node and the three leaves for each 3-star structure. Let's go step by step:

1. Identify nodes with exactly three edges (degree = 3):
   - Nodes 4 and 8 have a degree of 3.

2. For each node with degree 3, determine the adjacent nodes:
   - Node 4 is connected to nodes 3, 8, and 9. 
   - Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 9.

3. Count the number of 3-stars based on the above information:
   - From node 4: <4, (3, 8, 9)>
   - From node 8: <8, (1, 4, 9)> [2 3-stars]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
