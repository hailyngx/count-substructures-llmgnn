Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we can identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<1, (4, 5, 6)>
<2, (0, 9, 5)>
<3, (7, 9, 5)>
<4, (0, 1, 5)>
<5, (1, 4, 7)>
<6, (1, 9, 5)>
<7, (3, 5, 8)>
<8, (5, 7, 0)>
<9, (2, 3, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
