Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all unique occurrences where a node is connected to three other nodes in a star-like pattern.

Looking at the given edges and adjacency list, we can determine the 3-stars as follows:

1. Node 0: <0, (1, 2, 4)>, <0, (4, 6, 8)>, <0, (0, 7, 8)>
2. Node 4: <4, (0, 5, 8)>, <4, (0, 5, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
