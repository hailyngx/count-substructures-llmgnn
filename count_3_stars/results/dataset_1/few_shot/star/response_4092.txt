Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 6

Response:
Following the definition of a 3-star graph, we need to identify the central nodes and their corresponding leaf nodes that form 3-stars. 

Given the graph information:

Central node 1:
- (1, 2), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 9)

Central node 2:
- (2, 1), (2, 4), (2, 7), (2, 8)

Central node 4:
- (4, 2), (4, 5), (4, 8)

Central node 6:
- (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 5), (6, 7), (6, 9)

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in this graph are: 
<1, (2, 6, 7)>
<1, (2, 6, 9)>
<2, (1, 4, 7)>
<2, (1, 6, 8)>
<4, (2, 5, 8)>
<6, (0, 1, 3)>
<6, (0, 1, 5)>
<6, (0, 1, 7)>
<6, (0, 1, 9)>
<6, (3, 5, 7)>
<6, (3, 5, 9)>

Count of 3-stars: [11]
