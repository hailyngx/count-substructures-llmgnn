Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 9
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern with that node as the central node.

Based on the provided information, the 3-stars in the graph are as follows:
<0, (3, 4, 8)>
<1, (2, 7, 8)>
<2, (1, 4, 6)>
<4, (0, 2, 9)>
<7, (1, 2, 6)>
<8, (0, 1, 3)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
