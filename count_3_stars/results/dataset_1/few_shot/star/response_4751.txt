Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (3, 5) (3, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 6
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 6

Response:
Based on the given graph and definition of a 3-star, we need to find all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes. Let's find the 3-stars:

<0, (1, 7)>
<1, (0, 5, 6)>
<3, (5, 9)>
<5, (1, 3, 8)>
<6, (1, 9)>
<9, (3, 5, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
