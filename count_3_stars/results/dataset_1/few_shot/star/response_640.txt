Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 8

Response:
First, we need to identify all 3-stars in this graph. 
Since a 3-star has one central node and three leaves, we will look for nodes connected to exactly three other nodes. 
Let's list the 3-stars we find:

<1, (0, 7, 9)>
<2, (0, 8, 7)>
<6, (5, 7, 8)>
<9, (1, 8, 7)>

Counting the number of 3-stars found, we get a total of [4].
