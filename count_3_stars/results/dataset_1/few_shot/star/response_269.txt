Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star by finding a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step by step:

1. Identify 3-stars:
   - For each node in the graph, check if it is connected to exactly three other nodes.
   - If a node satisfies this condition, it is the center of a 3-star.

2. Count the 3-stars:
   - Once we identify the central node of a 3-star, list the connected nodes to complete the 3-star.
   - Count the unique 3-stars found.

Let's find the 3-stars:
<1, (3, 6, 9)>
<3, (0, 1, 9)>
<3, (1, 4, 6)>
<4, (3, 5, 9)>
<6, (1, 3, 9)>
<9, (1, 3, 4)>
<9, (3, 6, 8)>

Now, we count the number of unique 3-stars found:
