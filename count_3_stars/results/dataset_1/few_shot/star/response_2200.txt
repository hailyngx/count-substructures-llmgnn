Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 7, and node 8

Response:
First, let's identify the center nodes. The nodes connected to exactly three other nodes are the center nodes. 
From the given graph, nodes 0, 1, and 2 are the center nodes because they are each connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Now, let's find the 3-stars around each center node. 

For center node 0:
- <0, (1, 5, 7)>
- <0, (1, 7, 9)>

For center node 1:
- <1, (0, 2, 6)>

For center node 2:
- <2, (1, 3, 6)>
- <2, (1, 6, 9)>
- <2, (3, 6, 9)>

Counting the unique 3-stars found, we have a total of [5]. 
Therefore, the final answer is [5].
