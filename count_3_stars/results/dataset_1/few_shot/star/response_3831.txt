Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will look for each node that has exactly three neighbors and consider it as the center of a 3-star. Let's identify the 3-stars:

<2, (7, 8, 9)>
<5, (4, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
