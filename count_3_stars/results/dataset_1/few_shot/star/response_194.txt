Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
There are 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

<1, (0, 3, 5)>
<1, (2, 4, 8)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
