Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes (forming a 3-star pattern).

Looking at the adjacency list and the given edges, we can identify the 3-stars as follows:

<0, (1, 2, 9)>
<1, (0, 3, 5)>
<2, (0, 5, 7)>
<3, (1, 6, 7)>
<4, (6, 8)>
<5, (1, 2)>
<6, (3, 4, 9)>
<7, (2, 3, 8)>
<8, (1, 4, 7)>
<9, (0, 6)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
