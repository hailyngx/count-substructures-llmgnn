Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. We will carefully examine each node in the graph to find such cases.

The nodes connected to exactly three other nodes are: 0, 1, 3, and 6.

For node 0:
- <0, (1, 4, 5)>
- <0, (1, 4, 6)>
- <0, (1, 5, 7)>
- <0, (1, 6, 8)>
- <0, (4, 5, 6)>
- <0, (4, 5, 7)>
- <0, (4, 6, 8)>
- <0, (5, 6, 7)>
- <0, (5, 6, 8)>
- <0, (6, 7, 8)>

For node 1:
- <1, (0, 4, 6)>
- <1, (0, 5, 7)>
- <1, (0, 6, 8)>
- <1, (4, 6, 8)>
- <1, (4, 6, 7)>
- <1, (5, 6, 7)>
- <1, (5, 6, 8)>
- <1, (6, 7, 8)>

For node 3:
- <3, (4, 5, 7)>

For node 6:
- <6, (0, 1, 4)>
- <6, (0, 1, 8)>
- <6, (0, 4, 8)>
- <6, (1, 4, 8)>

Counting the unique 3-stars found above, we have counted 22 such 3-stars in total.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [22].
