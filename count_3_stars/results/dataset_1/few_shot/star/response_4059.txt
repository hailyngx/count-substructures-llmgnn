Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 7
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, creating a 3-star pattern. 

Let's analyze each node in the graph to find the 3-stars:
- Node 0: <0, (4, 5, 7)> (1 star)
- Node 2: <2, (5, 6, 8)> (1 star)
- Node 8: <8, (2, 5, 6)> (1 star)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3]. 
The unique 3-stars are <0, (4, 5, 7)>, <2, (5, 6, 8)>, and <8, (2, 5, 6)>.
