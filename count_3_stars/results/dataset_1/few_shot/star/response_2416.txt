Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star subgraphs in the given graph.

The graph has the following 3-stars:
<0, (5, 7, 8)>
<1, (3, 6, 8)>
<2, (3, 9, None)>
<3, (1, 2, 4)>
<4, (3, 5, None)>
<5, (0, 4, 8)>
<6, (1, 8, None)>
<7, (0, 8, None)>
<8, (5, 6, 7)>
<9, (2, None, None)>

Count of 3-stars: [9]
