Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star in the graph. 

Let's find the 3-stars in the graph step-by-step:

1. Look at each node in the graph.
2. For each node, check if it is connected to exactly three other nodes.
3. If it is, then it forms a 3-star with the current node as the center node and the three connected nodes as leaves.

Based on the given information, the 3-stars in the graph are as follows:

1. <0, (4, 5, 6)>
2. <0, (4, 6, 8)>
3. <0, (5, 6, 8)>
4. <2, (3, 6, 8)>
5. <4, (0, 8, 9)>
6. <7, (1, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6]. 
<0, (4, 5, 6)>, <0, (4, 6, 8)>, <0, (5, 6, 8)>, <2, (3, 6, 8)>, <4, (0, 8, 9)>, <7, (1, 8, 9)>
