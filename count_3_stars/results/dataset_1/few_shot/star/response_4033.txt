Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes (forming a 3-star pattern).

Based on the given information, we can identify the following 3-stars:

<0, (3, 5, 8)>
<0, (3, 8, 9)>
<1, (2, 6, 8)>
<2, (1, 3, 5)>
<2, (3, 5, 8)>
<3, (0, 2, 5)>
<3, (2, 5, 8)>
<8, (0, 1, 2)>
<8, (0, 3, 4)>
<8, (1, 2, 3)>
<8, (4, 9, 0)>
 
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [11].
