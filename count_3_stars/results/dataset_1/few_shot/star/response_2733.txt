Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all occurrences where a node is at the center of a 3-star. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

In this case, we will look for nodes that have exactly three neighbors and consider them as potential centers of 3-stars. Let's analyze each node's neighbors to find the 3-stars:

- Node 0: Connected to nodes 2 and 8.
- Node 1: Connected to node 3.
- Node 2: Connected to nodes 0 and 4.
- Node 3: Connected to nodes 1, 7, and 9. [Node 3 is a potential center.]
- Node 4: Connected to nodes 2, 7 and 8.
- Node 5: Connected to node 6.
- Node 6: Connected to node 5.
- Node 7: Connected to nodes 3, 4, and 9. [Node 7 is a potential center.]
- Node 8: Connected to nodes 0 and 4.
- Node 9: Connected to nodes 3 and 7.

Thus, we identified two potential centers for 3-stars: nodes 3 and 7.

Now, let's find the 3-stars centered at nodes 3 and 7:

- For node 3:
  - <3, (1, 7, 9)>
  
- For node 7:
  - <7, (3, 4, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
