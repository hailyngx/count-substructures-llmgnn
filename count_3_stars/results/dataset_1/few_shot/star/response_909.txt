Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the 3-stars present in the graph. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's find the 3-stars in the graph:

1. For Node 0 -> (0, 3, 8)
2. For Node 1 -> (1, 7, 8)
3. For Node 2 -> <2, (4, 6, 8)>
4. For Node 3 -> (3, 0, 4)
5. For Node 4 -> <4, (2, 5, 7)>
6. For Node 5 -> (5, 4, 6)
7. For Node 6 -> (6, 2, 7)
8. For Node 7 -> <7, (1, 4, 9)>
9. For Node 8 -> <8, (0, 2, 5)>
10. For Node 9 -> (9, 2, 7)

Count of 3-stars: [5]

Therefore, the final answer (the count of 3-stars) is [5].
