Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 0) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 8

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star subgraphs in the given graph. 

From the given information, we can identify the following 3-star subgraphs:
<0, (2, 6)>
<2, (0, 4, 5)>
<8, (2, 9)>
<9, (4, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
