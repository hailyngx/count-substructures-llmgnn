Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 4
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0: No 3-stars connected to node 0
2. Node 1: <1, (4, 5, 7)>
3. Node 2: <2, (0, 4, 6)>
4. Node 3: No 3-stars connected to node 3
5. Node 4: <4, (1, 2, 8)>
6. Node 5: No 3-stars connected to node 5
7. Node 6: <6, (0, 1, 2)>
8. Node 7: No 3-stars connected to node 7
9. Node 8: No 3-stars connected to node 8
10. Node 9: No 3-stars connected to node 9

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3]. 
The unique 3-stars found are <1, (4, 5, 7)>, <2, (0, 4, 6)>, and <4, (1, 2, 8)>.
