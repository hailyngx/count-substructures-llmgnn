Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 5, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star pattern. 

1. In a 3-star, one node is at the center and the other three nodes are connected to this center node. 
2. We look for nodes that have exactly 3 neighbors.

Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:
1. The nodes 4, 8, and 9 can be centers of 3-stars. 
2. For node 4: (0, 2, 8)
3. For node 8: (4, 5, 9)
4. For node 9: (5, 8, 8)

Thus, counting the unique 3-stars found, we have: 
[3] <4, (0, 2, 8)>, <8, (4, 5, 9)>, <9, (5, 8, 8)>
