Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify configurations where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Based on the given information, we can identify the 3-stars as follows:

<0, (4, 8, 4)>
<1, (2, 5, 1)>
<2, (1, 6, 9)>
<4, (0, 5, 8)>
<5, (1, 4, 6)>
<6, (2, 5, 9)>
<8, (0, 4, 0)>
<9, (2, 4, 6)>

Hence, there are a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
