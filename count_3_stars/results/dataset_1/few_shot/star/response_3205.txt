Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 7

Response:
The central nodes can be any nodes of degree three. From the given graph, nodes 4 and 7 have degree 3. Let's find the 3-stars with center nodes 4 and 7:

For node 4:
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 7, 8, and 9. Therefore, the 3-star with node 4 as the center is <4, (7, 8, 9)>.

For node 7:
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 9. Therefore, the 3-stars with node 7 as the center are <7, (3, 4, 9)>.

Thus, there are a total of [2] 3-stars in the given graph.
