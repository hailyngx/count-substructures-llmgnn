Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 5) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 2

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. In this case, we are looking for nodes that form a 3-star pattern.

Looking at the given graph, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (1, 7, 2)>
<1, (0, 2, 4)>
<2, (1, 4, 7)>
<4, (1, 2, 5)>
<5, (4, 6, 8)>
<6, (4, 5)>
<7, (0, 2)>
<8, (5)>
<9, (2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
