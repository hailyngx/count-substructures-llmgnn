Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 9
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the possible configurations of 3-stars. 

A 3-star can have the following configurations based on the adjacency list:
1. Center node connected to nodes (A, B, C)
2. Center node connected to nodes (B, A, C)
3. Center node connected to nodes (C, A, B)

Let's list down the 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<0, (2, 1, 3)>
<0, (3, 1, 4)>
<0, (4, 1, 2)>
<0, (4, 1, 9)>
<1, (0, 2, 4)>
<2, (0, 1, 8)>
<3, (0, 9, 4)>
<4, (0, 1, 9)>
<8, (2, 9, 0)>
<9, (0, 3, 4)>
<9, (0, 4, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14]. 
<0, (1, 2, 3)>, <0, (1, 2, 4)>, <0, (1, 3, 4)>, <0, (2, 1, 3)>, <0, (3, 1, 4)>, <0, (4, 1, 2)>, <0, (4, 1, 9)>, <1, (0, 2, 4)>, <2, (0, 1, 8)>, <3, (0, 9, 4)>, <4, (0, 1, 9)>, <8, (2, 9, 0)>, <9, (0, 3, 4)>, <9, (0, 4, 8)>
