Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to understand that a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Next, we can identify 3-stars in the graph by looking for nodes that have exactly three neighbors. 

Let's list the 3-stars in this graph:

<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<1, (4, 8, 9)>
<4, (0, 1, 9)>
<4, (0, 1, 8)>
<5, (0, 6, 7)>
<6, (0, 1, 2)>
<6, (0, 1, 3)>
<6, (0, 2, 5)>
<7, (5, 7, 8)>
<8, (4, 7, 9)>

Count of 3-stars: [12]
