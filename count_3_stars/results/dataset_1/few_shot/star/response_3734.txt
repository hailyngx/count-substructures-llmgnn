Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 3

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are:

<0, (1, 2, 8)>
<3, (2, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
