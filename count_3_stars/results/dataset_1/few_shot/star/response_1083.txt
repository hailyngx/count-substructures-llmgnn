Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all the possible 3-stars. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the provided information, we can identify the following 3-stars: 
<0, (4, 5, 9)>
<3, (1, 4, 9)>
<5, (2, 3, 8)>
<8, (3, 5, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
