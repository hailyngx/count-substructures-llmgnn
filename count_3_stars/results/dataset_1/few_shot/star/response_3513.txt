Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern. 
Let's find all the 3-stars:

1. Node 0 forms a 3-star: <0, (7, 8, 9)>
2. Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (7, 8, 9)>
3. Node 4 forms a 3-star: <4, (5, 7, 8)>
4. Node 6 forms a 3-star: <6, (5, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

<0, (7, 8, 9)>
<1, (7, 8, 9)>
<4, (5, 7, 8)>
<6, (5, 7, 9)>
