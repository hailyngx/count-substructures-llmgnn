Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, 7, and node 8

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify all the unique 3-stars in the graph.

Looking at the adjacency list of each node, we can enumerate the 3-stars as follows:
<0, (3, 8, 1)>
<1, (2, 3, 7)>
<3, (0, 1, 7)>
<4, (1, 7, 9)>
<5, (6, 8, 9)>
<7, (1, 3, 4)>
<8, (0, 3, 5)>
<9, (2, 4, 8)>
<9, (4, 5, 7)>
<9, (5, 7, 8)>

Now, we count the total number of unique 3-stars we found which is 9.

Therefore, the final answer is [9].
