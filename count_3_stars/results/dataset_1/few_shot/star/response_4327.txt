Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the provided adjacency list, we can identify the 3-stars as follows:
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 7, 9, and 0, forming a 3-star with node 2 as the center: <<2, (0, 7, 9)>>
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 7, 9, and 1, forming a 3-star with node 4 as the center: <<4, (1, 7, 9)>>
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 7, and 6, forming a 3-star with node 9 as the center: <<9, (2, 6, 7)>>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
