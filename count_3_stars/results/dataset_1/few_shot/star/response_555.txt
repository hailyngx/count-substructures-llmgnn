Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 7

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (4, 7, 8)>
<5, (0, 4, 9)>
<2, (3, 4, 6)>
<3, (2, 4, 7)>
<4, (0, 2, 3)>
<7, (0, 3, 9)>
<9, (4, 5, 7)>

Count of 3-stars: [7]
