Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 4
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 1

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star configurations in the graph:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 4, and 7: <0, (2, 4, 7)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 5, and 7: <1, (4, 5, 7)>
- Node 0 forms another 3-star with nodes 3, 7, and 9: <0, (3, 7, 9)>
- Node 1 forms another 3-star with nodes 6, 7, and 9: <1, (6, 7, 9)>

Therefore, there are a total of [4] 3-stars in the given graph.
