Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 5

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, creating a 3-star pattern with that node as the center.

Looking at the adjacency list, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (5, 8, 9)>
<2, (3, 7, 8)>
<5, (0, 6, 9)>
<7, (2, 4, 6)>
<8, (0, 2)>
<9, (0, 5)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we get a total of [6].
