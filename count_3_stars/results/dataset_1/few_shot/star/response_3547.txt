Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify groups of nodes that form 3-stars. 

Let's start by listing the 3-star configurations:

<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<1, (2, 3, 6)>
<2, (0, 1, 5)>
<3, (1, 5, 9)>
<4, (0, 5, -)>
<5, (2, 3, 4)>
<6, (0, 1, 5)>
<7, (1, 5, -)>
<8, (-, -, 9)>
<9, (2, 3, 8)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-star configurations []:
[9]
