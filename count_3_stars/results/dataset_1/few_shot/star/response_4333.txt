Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 7

Response:
First, let's identify the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

Based on the definition of a 3-star graph, we are looking for nodes that have exactly three edges (leaves) connecting to them. 

Looking at the adjacency list provided:

- Node 0 has 3 edges connected to it.
- Node 1 has 5 edges connected to it.
- Node 2 has 2 edges connected to it.
- Node 3 has 2 edges connected to it.
- Node 4 has 4 edges connected to it.
- Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
- Node 6 has 1 edge connected to it.
- Node 7 has 4 edges connected to it.
- Node 8 has 3 edges connected to it.
- Node 9 has 2 edges connected to it.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars in this graph:

<0, (2, 4, 7)>
<1, (2, 4, 7)>
<4, (0, 1, 7)>
<7, (0, 1, 4)>
 
The final answer is [4].
