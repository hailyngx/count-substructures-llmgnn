Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 6
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a star pattern.

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (3, 6, 9)>
<1, (3, 5, 6)>
<2, (7, 8, 0)>
<3, (0, 1, 6)>
<7, (2, 8, 9)>

Therefore, there are a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
