Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 5

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- Node 0: <0, (2, 6, 8)> and <0, (2, 6, 9)>
- Node 2: <2, (0, 1, 3)>
- Node 5: <5, (4, 6, 9)> and <5, (6, 8, 9)>
- Node 6: <6, (0, 4, 5)> and <6, (4, 5, 7)> and <6, (0, 5, 8)> 

So there are a total of [7] 3-star structures in the given graph.
