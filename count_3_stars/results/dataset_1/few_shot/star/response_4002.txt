Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 7
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star.

Looking at the given information, we can identify the 3-stars in this graph:

<0, (3, 7, 8)>
<1, (5, 6, 7)>
<3, (0, 2, 5)>
<6, (1, 2, 5)>
<7, (0, 1, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
