Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star in the graph. A 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Based on the adjacency list provided, we can determine the following unique 3-stars:

<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<0, (1, 3, 9)>
<2, (6, 7, 9)>
<3, (0, 1, 6)>
<3, (0, 6, 9)>
<3, (2, 6, 9)>
<6, (0, 1, 9)>
<7, (0, 2, 8)>
<9, (0, 2, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
