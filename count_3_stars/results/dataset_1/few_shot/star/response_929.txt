Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7)

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, creating a 3-star pattern.

Let's go through the adjacency list of each node:
1. For Node 0: No 3-star can be formed as it is connected to only 2 nodes.
2. For Node 1: No 3-star can be formed as it is connected to only 2 nodes.
3. For Node 2: <2, (0, 3, 4)>, <2, (0, 5, 6)>, and <2, (3, 4, 6)> are the possible 3-stars.
4. For Node 3: <3, (1, 2, 4)> is the only 3-star possible.
5. For Node 4: <4, (2, 3, 5)> and <4, (2, 7, 8)> are the possible 3-stars.
6. For Node 5: No 3-star can be formed as it is connected to only 2 nodes.
7. For Node 6: No 3-star can be formed as it is connected to only 2 nodes.
8. For Node 7: <7, (4, 6, 9)> is the only 3-star possible.
9. For Node 8: No 3-star can be formed as it is connected to only 1 node.
10. For Node 9: No 3-star can be formed as it is connected to only 3 nodes.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5]. 
The unique 3-stars found are <2, (0, 3, 4)>, <2, (0, 5, 6)>, <2, (3, 4, 6)>, <3, (1, 2, 4)>, and <4, (2, 3, 5)>.
