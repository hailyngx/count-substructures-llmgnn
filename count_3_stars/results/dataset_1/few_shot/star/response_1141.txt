Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 8

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are as follows:
<0, (1, 2, 6)>
<1, (0, 4, 6)>
<2, (0, 6, 3)>
<3, (4, 5, 6)>
<4, (1, 3, 6)>
<5, (3, 8, 6)>
<6, (0, 2, 4)>
<8, (3, 5, 9)>
<9, (4, 8, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
