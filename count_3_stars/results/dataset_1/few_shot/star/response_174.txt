Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 1

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the given graph.
We will go through each node in the graph and check if it forms a 3-star with its neighbors.

Starting with each node:
1. Node 0: Forms 0 3-stars.
2. Node 1: Forms 1 3-star <1, (2, 6, 9)>.
3. Node 2: Forms 1 3-star <2, (1, 3, 6)>.
4. Node 3: Forms 0 3-stars.
5. Node 4: Forms 0 3-stars.
6. Node 5: Forms 0 3-stars.
7. Node 6: Forms 1 3-star <6, (1, 2, 4)>.
8. Node 7: Forms 0 3-stars.
9. Node 8: Forms 0 3-stars.
10. Node 9: Forms 1 3-star <9, (0, 1, 9)>.

Count of 3-stars in the graph: [3]
Unique 3-stars: <1, (2, 6, 9)>, <2, (1, 3, 6)>, <9, (0, 1, 9)>
