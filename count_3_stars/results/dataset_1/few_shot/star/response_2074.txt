Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 4

Response:
The 3-stars in the graph are as follows:

<0, (4, 9, 2)>
<1, (2, 6, 7)>
<2, (3, 4, 7)>
<2, (4, 5, 9)>
<2, (1, 6, 7)>
<3, (2, 4, 6)>
<4, (0, 2, 9)>
<6, (1, 2, 3)>
<7, (1, 2, 4)>
<8, (1, 5, 7)>
<9, (0, 2, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [11].
