Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Here are the 3-stars found in the graph along with their central node and leaf nodes:

<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<3, (0, 2, 5)>
<4, (0, 8, 9)>
<5, (0, 2, 3)>
<8, (1, 4, 7)>
<9, (4, 5, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [6].
