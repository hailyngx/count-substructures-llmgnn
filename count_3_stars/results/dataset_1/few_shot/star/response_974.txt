Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 9) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 4, 7, and node 8

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (0, 2, 3)>
2. Node 7 forms a 3-star: <7, (0, 6, 8)>
3. Node 9 forms a 3-star: <9, (1, 4, 8)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
