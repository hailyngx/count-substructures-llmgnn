Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, and node 7

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star pattern where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Looking at the adjacency list for each node, we can see the connections between nodes. By identifying nodes where two other nodes share a connection to the same node (forming a 3-star pattern), we can count the number of 3-stars in the graph. 

Let's identify the 3-stars present in the graph:

<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<1, (2, 4, 7)>
<1, (2, 6, 7)>
<1, (4, 6, 7)>
<3, (0, 2, 4)>
<3, (2, 4, 7)>
<5, (0, 6, 9)>
<5, (6, 8, 9)>
<7, (1, 3, 9)>
<7, (3, 8, 9)>

Count of 3-stars: [11]
