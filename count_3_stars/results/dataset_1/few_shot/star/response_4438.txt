Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 7

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern with itself as the center.

Based on the given information, here are the 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (2, 4, 7)>
<2, (0, 4, 9)>
<3, (2, 4, 9)>
<4, (0, 2, 7)>
<7, (0, 4, 9)>
<9, (1, 2, 3)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
