Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where there is a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (2, 8, 0)>
<1, (3, 4, 1)>
<2, (0, 8, 2)>
<3, (1, 4, 3)>
<7, (4, 5, 7)>
<8, (0, 2, 8)>
<9, (3, 5, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
