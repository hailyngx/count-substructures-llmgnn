Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 4, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 6

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 

The 3-stars in the graph are:
<0, (4, 7, 9)>
<2, (3, 6, 8)>
<4, (0, 6, 7)>
<6, (2, 4, 7)>
<7, (0, 4, 5)>
<8, (2, 4, 6)>
<9, (0, 4, 6)>

Therefore, there are a total of [7] 3-stars in the graph.
