Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 2) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 2

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 3, and 6.
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 4, 6.
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 5, 8.
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 2, 9.
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 2, 4.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 3, 6)>
<2, (0, 4, 6)>
<3, (0, 5, 8)>
<4, (1, 2, 9)>
<9, (1, 2, 4)>
