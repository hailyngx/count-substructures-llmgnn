Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
1. Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 9, forming the following 3-stars:
   - <1, (2, 3, 4)>
   - <1, (3, 2, 6)>
   - <1, (4, 2, 5)>
   - <1, (5, 2, 1)>
   - <1, (6, 2, 3)>
   - <1, (9, 2, 5)>
