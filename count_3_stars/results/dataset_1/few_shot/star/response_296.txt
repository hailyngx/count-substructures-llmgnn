Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 5

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are as follows:
[3]

Therefore, the final answer is [1].
