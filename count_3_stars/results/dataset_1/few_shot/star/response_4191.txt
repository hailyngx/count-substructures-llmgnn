Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 5, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern.

Looking at the adjacency list, we can see that there are four nodes (3, 5, 7, and 8) that are connected to exactly three other nodes each. These nodes can act as the central nodes of 3-stars.

Now, let's determine the leaves of each 3-star centered at these nodes:
- For node 3: (3, 4, 5), (3, 7, 8)
- For node 5: (5, 2, 9), (5, 3, 8)
- For node 7: (7, 4, 9), (7, 5, 8)
- For node 8: (8, 3, 9), (8, 5, 7)

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are:
<3, (4, 5, 7)>, <3, (7, 8, 5)>, <5, (2, 9, 5)>, <5, (3, 8, 5)>, <7, (4, 9, 7)>, <7, (8, 5, 7)>, <8, (3, 9, 8)>, <8, (5, 7, 8)>.

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is: [8].
