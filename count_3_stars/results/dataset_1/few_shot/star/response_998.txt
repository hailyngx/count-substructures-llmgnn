Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 9
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 7

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph using the definition provided.

From the adjacency list:
- Node 0 forms 3-stars with nodes 1, 5, and 7.
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with node 0.
- Node 2 forms 3-stars with nodes 5 and 7.
- Node 3 forms 3-stars with nodes 1, 2, and 7.
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with node 2.
- Node 6 does not form any 3-stars.
- Node 7 forms 3-stars with nodes 0, 2, and 9.
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with node 7.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the graph are:
<0, 1, 5, 7>
<2, 5, 7>
<3, 1, 2, 7>
<7, 0, 2, 9>

There are 4 unique 3-stars in the graph, so the final answer is [4].
