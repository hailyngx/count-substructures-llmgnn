Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 7

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star present. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<1, (4, 5, 7)>
<1, (4, 7, 9)>
<1, (5, 7, 9)>
<1, (4, 5, 9)>
<7, (0, 1, 9)>
<9, (1, 3, 7)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars gives us a total of [6].
