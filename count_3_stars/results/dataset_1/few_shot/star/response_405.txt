Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 5

Response:
To find all the 3-star structures in the given graph, we can look for each node that has exactly 3 edges and forms a star around it. 

Looking at the adjacency list:
- Node 0 has 2 edges
- Node 1 has 4 edges
- Node 2 has 2 edges
- Node 3 has 1 edge
- Node 4 has 2 edges
- Node 5 has 2 edges
- Node 6 has 2 edges
- Node 7 has 2 edges
- Node 8 has 2 edges
- Node 9 has 3 edges

Since node 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 have less than 3 edges and node 1 has more than 3 edges, we focus on the node 9 as it has exactly 3 edges.

Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 5. Therefore, there is a 3-star centered at node 9 with leaves 1, 4, and 5: <9, (1, 4, 5)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1].

<9, (1, 4, 5)>
