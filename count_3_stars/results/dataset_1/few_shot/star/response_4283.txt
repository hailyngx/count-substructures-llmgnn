Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars, we need to look for nodes that are the centers of 3-stars in the given graph. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph based on the given information.

The 3-stars in the graph are:
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<2, (0, 3, 5)>
<3, (2, 5, 7)>
<5, (0, 2, 4)>
<7, (3, 5, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
