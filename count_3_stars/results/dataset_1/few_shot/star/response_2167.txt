Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 5

Response:
Initially, let's identify the nodes which can act as centers of 3-stars. Nodes with exactly 3 edges are potential centers. 
From the given adjacency list:
- Node 0 has 1 edge
- Node 1 has 1 edge
- Node 2 has 4 edges
- Node 3 has 1 edge
- Node 4 has 2 edges
- Node 5 has 4 edges
- Node 6 has 0 edges
- Node 7 has 3 edges
- Node 8 has 2 edges
- Node 9 has 2 edges

Therefore, nodes 7 and 2 are potential center nodes. 

Let's find the 3-stars where the center is node 7:
- <7, (2, 3, 8)>
- <7, (2, 8, 5)>

Now, let's find the 3-stars where the center is node 2:
- <2, (4, 0, 5)>
- <2, (4, 5, 1)>
- <2, (4, 5, 9)>
- <2, (5, 1, 9)>
- <2, (5, 8, 7)>
- <2, (5, 9, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6], as shown above.
