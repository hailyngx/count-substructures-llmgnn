Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 4

Response:
There are three 3-stars in the given graph. 

<[0, (1, 2, 4)]>
<[1, (0, 3, 4)]>
<[2, (0, 7, 9)]>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
