Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are as follows:
<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<5, (0, 4, 7)>
<5, (0, 7, 9)>
<6, (0, 2, 4)>
<6, (0, 4, 8)>
<6, (2, 4, 8)>
