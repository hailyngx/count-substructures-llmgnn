Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-star configurations in the graph.

Given the definition of a 3-star graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify all such 3-stars:

<1, (3, 4, 7)>
<3, (1, 5, 6)>
<5, (3, 7, 8)>
<7, (2, 4, 6)>
<7, (3, 4, 8)>

There are a total of [5] unique 3-stars in the graph.
