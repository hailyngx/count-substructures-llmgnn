Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to look for each node that has exactly three edges originating from it, and these edges should not form a triangle among themselves. Let's find all the 3-stars:

- Node 0 is connected to 4 other nodes: 2, 3, 4, and 8. This forms two 3-stars: <0, (2, 3, 4)> and <0, (2, 3, 8)>.

- Node 1 is connected to 4 other nodes: 3, 4, 5, and 6. This forms two 3-stars: <1, (3, 4, 5)> and <1, (3, 4, 6)>.

- Node 3 is connected to 5 other nodes: 0, 1, 2, 5, and 6. This forms two 3-stars: <3, (0, 2, 5)> and <3, (1, 2, 6)>.

- Node 6 is connected to 5 other nodes: 1, 3, 7, 8, and 9. This forms one 3-star: <6, (1, 7, 8)>.

Therefore, there are a total of 5 unique 3-stars.
