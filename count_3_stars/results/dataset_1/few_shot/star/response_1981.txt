Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 2

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to find the unique cases where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through each node and identify the 3-stars:

1. Node 0: Connected to nodes 4, 5, and 9
   - 3-star: <0, (4, 5, 9)>

2. Node 1: Connected to nodes 3, 4, and 9
   - 3-star: <1, (3, 4, 9)>

3. Node 2: Connected to nodes 5, 7, and 9
   - 3-star: <2, (5, 7, 9)>

4. Node 3: Connected to nodes 1, 4, 5, and 6
   - 3-star 1: <3, (1, 4, 5)>
   - 3-star 2: <3, (4, 5, 6)>

5. Node 4: Connected to nodes 0, 1, and 3
   - 3-star: <4, (0, 1, 3)>

6. Node 5: Connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, and 6
   - 3-star 1: <5, (0, 2, 3)>
   - 3-star 2: <5, (2, 3, 6)>

7. Node 6: Connected to nodes 3, 5, 7, and 8
   - 3-star: <6, (3, 5, 7)>

8. Node 7: Connected to nodes 2 and 6
   - No 3-star

9. Node 8: Connected to node 6
   - No 3-star

10. Node 9: Connected to nodes 0, 1, and 2
   - No 3-star

By examining the connections, we find a total of 9 unique 3-stars.
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
<0, (4, 5, 9)>, <1, (3, 4, 9)>, <2, (5, 7, 9)>, <3, (1, 4, 5)>, <3, (4, 5, 6)>, <4, (0, 1, 3)>, <5, (0, 2, 3)>, <5, (2, 3, 6)>, <6, (3, 5, 7)>
