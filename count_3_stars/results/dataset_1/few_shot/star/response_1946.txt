Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node and its adjacent nodes for each potential 3-star configuration.

Looking at the adjacency list, we can identify the following unique 3-stars: 
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<0, (3, 4, 6)>
<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<1, (2, 5, 9)>
<2, (1, 5, 9)>
<2, (3, 5, 7)>
<2, (5, 7, 9)>
<4, (7, 8, 9)>
<6, (7, 9, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
