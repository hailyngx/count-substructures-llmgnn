Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all occurrences of 3-stars. 
Let's go step-by-step:

1. Node 0 has 4 edges which form 3 unique 3-stars:
   - <0, (3, 4, 7)>
   - <0, (3, 7, 8)>
   - <0, (4, 7, 8)>

2. Node 1 has 3 edges which form 1 unique 3-star:
   - <1, (5, 7, 8)>

3. Node 2 has 2 edges, so it cannot form any 3-star.

4. Node 3 has 2 edges, so it cannot form any 3-star.

5. Node 4 has 3 edges which form 2 unique 3-stars:
   - <4, (0, 6, 8)>
   - <4, (6, 8, 5)>

6. Node 5 has 3 edges which form 2 unique 3-stars:
   - <5, (1, 8, 9)>
   - <5, (8, 9, 6)>

7. Node 6 has 2 edges, so it cannot form any 3-star.

8. Node 7 has 3 edges which form 1 unique 3-star:
   - <7, (0, 1, 9)>

9. Node 8 has 4 edges which form 3 unique 3-stars:
   - <8, (0, 4, 1)>
   - <8, (4, 1, 5)>
   - <8, (1, 5, 9)>

10. Node 9 has 4 edges which form 3 unique 3-stars:
   - <9, (2, 3, 5)>
   - <9, (3, 5, 7)>
   - <9, (5, 7, 1)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [16].
