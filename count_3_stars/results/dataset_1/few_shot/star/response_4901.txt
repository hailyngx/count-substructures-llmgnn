Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 2

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are as follows:
<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<1, (6, 7, 8)>
<2, (8, 9, -)>
<3, (4, 6, -)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
