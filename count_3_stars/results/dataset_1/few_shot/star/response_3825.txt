Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 7
