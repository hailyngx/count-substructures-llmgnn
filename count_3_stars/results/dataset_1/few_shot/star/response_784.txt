Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star pattern, which consists of a center node connected to three other nodes. Let's examine each node and its connections:

1. Node 0: Forms a 3-star with center 0, and leaves 2, 5. <0, (2, 5)>
2. Node 1: Does not form any 3-star.
3. Node 2: Forms a 3-star with center 2, and leaves 0, 6, 8. <2, (0, 6, 8)>
4. Node 3: Does not form any 3-star.
5. Node 4: Forms a 3-star with center 4, and leaves 7, 8, 9. <4, (7, 8, 9)>
6. Node 5: Does not form any 3-star.
7. Node 6: Does not form any 3-star.
8. Node 7: Forms a 3-star with center 7, and leaves 3, 4, 9. <7, (3, 4, 9)>
9. Node 8: Does not form any 3-star.
10. Node 9: Does not form any 3-star.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].  
The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (2, 5)>, <2, (0, 6, 8)>, <4, (7, 8, 9)>
