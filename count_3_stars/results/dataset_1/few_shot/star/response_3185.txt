Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 8

Response:
The 3-stars are as follows:
- <2, (4, 7, 9)>
- <7, (2, 4, 6)>
- <8, (5, 6, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
