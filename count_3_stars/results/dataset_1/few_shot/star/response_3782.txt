Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the sets of nodes that form 3-stars. 

Let's list down the 3-stars present in the given graph:

<0, (2, 5, 7)>
<0, (2, 5, 8)>
<0, (2, 7, 8)>
<1, (2, 3, 4)>
<1, (2, 3, 8)>
<1, (2, 4, 8)>
<2, (0, 1, 5)>
<2, (0, 5, 7)>
<2, (0, 5, 9)>
<2, (1, 5, 7)>
<2, (1, 5, 9)>
<2, (7, 4, 8)>
<3, (1, 6, 9)>
<3, (4, 6, 9)>
<3, (7, 4, 9)>
<4, (1, 6, 9)>
<4, (6, 3, 5)>
<4, (6, 5, 9)>
<5, (0, 2, 6)>
<5, (2, 6, 9)>
<5, (6, 3, 9)>
<6, (3, 4, 5)>
<7, (0, 2, 4)>
<7, (2, 4, 9)>
<8, (0, 1, 3)>
<8, (1, 3, 4)>
<8, (3, 4, 9)>
<9, (3, 4, 5)>
<9, (4, 5, 7)>

Finally, counting all the unique 3-stars, we get a total of [29] 3-stars in the given graph.
