Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 3

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where one node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern.

Starting with Node 0:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 2, and 5: <0, (1, 2, 5)>
- Node 0 forms another 3-star with nodes 1, 8, and 9: <0, (1, 8, 9)>

Moving on to Node 1:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 2, and 5: <1, (0, 2, 5)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 6, and 8: <1, (2, 6, 8)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 7, and 8: <1, (6, 7, 8)>
- Node 1 forms another 3-star with nodes 0, 8, and 9: <1, (0, 8, 9)>

Node 2 does not form any 3-star as it only has two neighbors.

Node 3 does not form any 3-star as it only has one neighbor.

Node 4 does not form any 3-star as it only has one neighbor.

Node 5 does not form any 3-star as it only has two neighbors.

Moving on to Node 6:
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 2, and 7: <6, (1, 2, 7)>
- Node 6 forms another 3-star with nodes 1, 7, and 8: <6, (1, 7, 8)>

Node 7 does not form any 3-star as it only has one neighbor.

Node 8 does not form any 3-star as it only has two neighbors.

Node 9 does not form any 3-star as it only has two neighbors.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
