Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we can identify the 3-stars:

<0, (4, 8, 2)>
<2, (3, 4, 7)>
<4, (0, 2, 8)>
<6, (4, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 4, 5)>
<9, (6, 8, 8)>

Count of 3-stars: [6]
