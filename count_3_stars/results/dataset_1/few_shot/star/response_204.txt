Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern. 
Since a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can analyze each node and its neighbors to find 3-stars.

Let's list down the unique 3-stars:
<0, (4, 6, 8)>
<1, (2, 6, 7)>
<4, (0, 5, 7)>
<8, (0, 1, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
