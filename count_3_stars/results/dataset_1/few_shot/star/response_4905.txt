Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern.

Looking at the adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (1, 6, 8)>
<0, (1, 6, 9)>
<0, (1, 8, 9)>
<1, (0, 2, 5)>
<2, (1, 4, 8)>
<3, (9)>
<4, (2)>
<5, (1, 6, 7)>
<5, (1, 7, 8)>
<5, (6, 7, 8)>
<8, (0, 2, 5)>
<9, (0, 3, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [11].
