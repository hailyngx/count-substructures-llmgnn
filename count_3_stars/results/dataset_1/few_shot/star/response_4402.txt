Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible combinations of central nodes and their connected leaves. 

From the information provided, we can directly see that:
- Node 0, with neighbors 1, 8, and 9, can form 1 unique 3-star.
- Node 1, with neighbors 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9, can form 4 unique 3-stars.
- Node 2, with neighbors 3, 6, 7, and 8, cannot form any 3-star since it has only 4 neighbors.
- Node 3, with neighbors 1, 2, 4, and 5, can form 1 unique 3-star.
- Node 4, with neighbors 1, 3, and 8, can form 1 unique 3-star.
- Node 5, with neighbors 1, 3, 8, and 9, can form 2 unique 3-stars.
- Node 6, with neighbors 1, 2, and 8, can form 1 unique 3-star.
- Node 7, with neighbors 1, 2, and 8, can form 1 unique 3-star.
- Node 8, with neighbors 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9, can form 3 unique 3-stars.
- Node 9, with neighbors 0, 1, 5, and 8, can form 1 unique 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
