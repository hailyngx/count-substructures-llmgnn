Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 6) (3, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 3) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 1

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node has exactly three neighbors forming a 3-star pattern with it as the center.

Looking at the adjacency list provided:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors, not a 3-star.
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors, not a 3-star.
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors, not a 3-star.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors, not a 3-star.
- Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors, not a 3-star.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: (0, 2, 3) forming a 3-star <6, (0, 2, 3)>.
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors, not a 3-star.
- Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
- Node 9 has 1 neighbor, not a 3-star.

Thus, there is only one unique 3-star in the graph, which is <6, (0, 2, 3)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1].
