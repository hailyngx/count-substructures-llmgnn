Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all occurrences where one node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Looking at the provided adjacency list, we see that the nodes connected to exactly three other nodes are:
Node 0, Node 2, Node 5, Node 6, Node 7, and Node 8. 

Let's analyze each of these nodes in turn:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 7, and 8. This forms a 3-star with Node 0 as the center and nodes 5, 6, 7 as the leaves. <0, (5, 6, 7)>
   
2. Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 6, and 7. This forms two 3-stars:
   - <2, (3, 5, 6)>
   - <2, (3, 5, 7)>
   
3. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 6. This forms a 3-star with Node 5 as the center and nodes 0, 2, 6 as the leaves. <5, (0, 2, 6)>
   
4. Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 5, and 7. This forms a 3-star with Node 6 as the center and nodes 0, 2, 7 as the leaves. <6, (0, 2, 7)>
   
5. Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 9. This forms two 3-stars:
   - <7, (0, 2, 3)>
   - <7, (0, 2, 6)>
   
6. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 6, and 9. This forms a 3-star with Node 8 as the center and nodes 0, 2, 9 as the leaves. <8, (0, 2, 9)>
   
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7], as there are 7 unique 3-stars as listed above.
