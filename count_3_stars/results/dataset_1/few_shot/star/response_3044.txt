Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all occurrences where a node in the graph is connected to exactly three other nodes. These will be the 3-stars in the graph.

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (5, 9, 1)>
<2, (4, 5, 6)>
<4, (2, 3, 5)>
<6, (2, 4, 7)>
<9, (0, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
