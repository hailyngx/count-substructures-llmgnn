Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 8

Response:
The center of the 3-star must be a node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. Looking at the adjacency list, we can see that nodes 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8 have 3 connections each, making them potential centers.

Let's check each potential center and see if they form a 3-star pattern:

1. Node 1:
   Node 1 is connected to nodes 4 and 8. They do not form a 3-star pattern as there is no third connection.
   
2. Node 2:
   Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 6. This forms a 3-star with node 2 as the center and nodes 4, 5, and 6 as the leaves: <2, (4, 5, 6)>
   
3. Node 4:
   Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 7. This forms a 3-star with node 4 as the center and nodes 1, 2, and 7 as the leaves: <4, (1, 2, 7)>
   
4. Node 5:
   Node 5 is connected to nodes 2 and 9. They do not form a 3-star pattern as there is no third connection.
   
5. Node 7:
   Node 7 is connected to nodes 4 and 6. They do not form a 3-star pattern as there is no third connection.
   
6. Node 8:
   Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 6, and 9. This forms a 3-star with node 8 as the center and nodes 1, 6, and 9 as the leaves: <8, (1, 6, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is:
[2] 
The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (4, 5, 6)>, <4, (1, 2, 7)>, <8, (1, 6, 9)>
