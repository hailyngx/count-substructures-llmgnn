Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and node 8

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are:

<0, (2, 5, 9)>
<1, (5, 7, 8)>
<2, (0, 5, 9)>
<5, (0, 1, 8)>
<9, (0, 2, 8)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
