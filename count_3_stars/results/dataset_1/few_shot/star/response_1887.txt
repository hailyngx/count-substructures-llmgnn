Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 3) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 3
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 3

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a 3-star pattern.

Upon examining the adjacency list and the edges provided, we can identify the following 3-stars:

<0, (1, 4, 3)>
<1, (0, 6, 9)>
<3, (0, 2, 9)>
<6, (1, 4, 3)>
<9, (1, 2, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
