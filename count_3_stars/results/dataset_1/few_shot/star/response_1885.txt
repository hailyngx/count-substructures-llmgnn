Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 4, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the 3-stars. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

To make the process simpler, let's list down the 3-stars present in the graph:
<0, (2, 7, 8)>
<1, (2, 4, 7)>
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<4, (1, 2, 5)>
<7, (0, 1, 4)>
<8, (0, 3, 7)>
<9, (4, 6, 9)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph. The answer is [7].
