Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 8

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. First, we will find all nodes connected to exactly three other nodes.
    - Node 0, Node 4, and Node 8 are the nodes connected to exactly three other nodes. 

2. Next, we will list the 3-stars with the center node as one of the nodes found in step 1.
    - For Node 0: <0, (1, 3, 5)> and <0, (1, 5, 9)>
    - For Node 4: <4, (5, 0, 8)>
    - For Node 8: <8, (1, 3, 9)> and <8, (1, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5]. 
The unique 3-stars are: <0, (1, 3, 5)>, <0, (1, 5, 9)>, <4, (5, 0, 8)>, <8, (1, 3, 9)>, <8, (1, 7, 9)>.
