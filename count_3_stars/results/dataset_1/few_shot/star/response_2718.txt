Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern.

Based on the given information, the nodes and their connections are as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 6, and 7
- Node 1 is connected to node 5
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 5 and 7
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 7, 8, and 9
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 5, and 7
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, and 4
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 8, and 9
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, and 9
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 3 and 6
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 3, 6, and 7

Let's identify the 3-stars:
- <0, (4, 5, 7)>
- <3, (4, 7, 9)>
- <4, (0, 5, 7)>
- <5, (0, 2, 4)>
- <6, (0, 8, 9)>
- <7, (0, 2, 4)>
- <8, (3, 6, 9)>
- <9, (3, 6, 7)>

Count of 3-stars: [8]
