Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 5, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, which forms a 3-star pattern.

Looking at the adjacency list for each node, we can find the following 3-stars:
<0, (5, 8, 9)>
<3, (5, 6, 8)>
<4, (5, 8, 9)>
<5, (0, 3, 4)>
<8, (0, 1, 3)>
<9, (0, 2, 4)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
