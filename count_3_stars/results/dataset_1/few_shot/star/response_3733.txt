Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 
Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (4, 6, 7)>
<1, (2, 6, 8)>
<2, (1, 5, 8)>
<3, (4, 6, -)>
<4, (0, 3, 9)>
<5, (2, 8, 9)>
<6, (0, 1, 3)>
<7, (0, -, -)>
<8, (1, 2, 5)>
<9, (4, 5, 6)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph.
