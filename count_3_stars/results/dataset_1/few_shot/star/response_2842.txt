Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the unique 3-stars present in the graph. 

Looking at the definition of a 3-star graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

From the given adjacency list, the possible 3-stars are:

<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<0, (2, 3, 6)>
<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<0, (4, 6, 7)>
<2, (0, 1, 7)>
<2, (0, 7, 9)>
<6, (0, 4, 5)>
<6, (4, 5, 7)>
<6, (0, 5, 9)>
<7, (0, 2, 3)>
<7, (0, 2, 9)>
<7, (2, 6, 9)>

Counting all the unique 3-stars listed above, we get a total of [12] 3-stars.
