Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all occurrences where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Upon analyzing the graph, we find the following 3-stars: 
<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<1, (2, 5, 6)>
<2, (0, 1, 4)>
<4, (0, 2, 5)>
<5, (1, 3, 4)>
<8, (3, 4, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
