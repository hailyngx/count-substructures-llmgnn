Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 3

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can identify each 3-star pattern where a center node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Based on the given information, here are the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (2, 5, 8)>
<1, (2, 9, -)>
<2, (0, 1, 8)>
<3, (7, 8, 9)>
<5, (0, 6, -)>
<6, (5, -, -)>
<7, (3, 4, -)>
<9, (1, 3, -)>

Count of 3-stars: [8]
