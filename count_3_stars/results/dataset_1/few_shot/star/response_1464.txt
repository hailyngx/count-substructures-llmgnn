Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes to form a 3-star pattern.

From the given information, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (2, 6, 8)>
<0, (6, 7, 8)>
<2, (0, 4, 6)>
<4, (2, 6, 7)>
<6, (0, 1, 2)>
<6, (3, 4, 7)>
<7, (0, 4, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
