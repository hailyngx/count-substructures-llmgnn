Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-star subgraphs in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern. 

Given the structure of the graph where a 3-star consists of a center node connected to 3 other nodes, we can simply list all the 3-star configurations. 

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (4, 7, 9)>
<1, (4, 5, 9)>
<2, (6, 7, _)>
<4, (0, 1, 8)>
<5, (1, 9, _)>
<6, (2, 7, _)>
<7, (0, 2, 6)>
<8, (4, 9, _)>

Therefore, there are a total of [8] 3-star subgraphs in the given graph.
