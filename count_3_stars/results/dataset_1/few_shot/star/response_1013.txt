Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 2

Response:
To count the number of 3-star subgraphs in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern.

Let's identify the 3-star subgraphs in the given graph:

1. Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 4, and 9: <2, (1, 4, 9)>
2. Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, and 4: <3, (0, 1, 4)>
3. Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, and 3: <4, (0, 1, 3)>
4. Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 3, and 8: <5, (2, 3, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-star subgraphs in the given graph is [4].
