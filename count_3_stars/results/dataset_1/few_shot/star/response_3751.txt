Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern.

Looking at the adjacency list, we can see that node 0, node 2, and node 8 have degree 3, which suggests the presence of potential 3-stars around these nodes.

Now, let's list down the unique 3-stars found in the given graph:

<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<2, (0, 3, 8)>
<8, (0, 2, 4)>

Count of 3-stars in the graph: [3]
