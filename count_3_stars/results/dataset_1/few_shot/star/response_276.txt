Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all occurrences of the 3-star pattern. 

First, let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (3, 8, 5)>
<1, (7, 9, 6)>
<5, (8, 9, 6)>
<6, (7, 9, 5)>

Now, counting the total number of 3-stars in the graph:
[4]
