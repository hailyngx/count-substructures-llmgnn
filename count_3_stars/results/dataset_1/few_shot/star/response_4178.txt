Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (6, 4) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
There are three 3-stars in the given graph. 

The 3-stars are: 
<0, (5, 4, 3)>
<2, (8, 7, 4)>
<7, (8, 2, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
