Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify sets of nodes that form 3-stars. 

Looking at the definition of a 3-star graph, we can see that the only possible 3-stars in this graph will have the center as one of the nodes {0, 2, 9} since they have degree 5, 3, and 4 respectively.

Let's list the unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 3, 7)>
<0, (1, 8, 9)>
<0, (3, 4, 7)>
<0, (7, 8, 9)>
<2, (5, 8, 9)>
<9, (6, 7, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
