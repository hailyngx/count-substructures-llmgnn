Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 4, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern.

Nodes 0, 6, and 9 are the centers of 3-stars in this graph. Let's list the 3-stars:
<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<6, (7, 8, 0)>
<9, (7, 8, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
