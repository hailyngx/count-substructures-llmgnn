Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible 3-stars by looking at each node as a potential center node.

Given the information provided, we can see that the potential center nodes are: 0, 4, 6, 8, and 9.

Let's check each potential center node along with its adjacent nodes to identify the 3-stars:

1. Center node 0:
   - Possible 3-star: <0, (4, 8, 9)>
   
2. Center node 4:
   - Possible 3-star: <4, (0, 2, 6)>
   
3. Center node 6:
   - Possible 3-stars: <6, (1, 4, 5)> and <6, (4, 5, 9)>
   
4. Center node 8:
   - Possible 3-star: <8, (0, 2, 5)>
   
5. Center node 9:
   - No 3-star can be formed around node 9 as it has only two connections.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4]. 
The unique 3-stars found are <0, (4, 8, 9)>, <4, (0, 2, 6)>, <6, (1, 4, 5)>, and <8, (0, 2, 5)>.
