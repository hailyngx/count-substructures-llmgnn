Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 3

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can identify the central node of each 3-star, then find all connected nodes to that central node. If there are exactly 3 connected nodes, we have found a 3-star.

Let's list the 3-stars we find and then count them:

<0, (2, 7, 8)>
<2, (0, 7, 9)>
<3, (0, 7, 9)>
<7, (0, 2, 3)>
<9, (0, 2, 3)>

Counting the unique 3-stars from above, we get a total of [5].
