Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's first identify and list all the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (1, 3, 6)>
<1, (0, 5, 6)>
<2, (4, 5, 6)>
<3, (0, 5, 8)>
<4, (2, 5, 9)>
<5, (1, 2, 3)>
<6, (0, 1, 2)>
<7, (6, 8)>
<8, (2, 3, 5)>
<9, (2, 3, 4)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph:
