Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern.

Looking at the adjacency list, we can see which nodes are connected to three other nodes:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 6, 8, and 9
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 9
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 5, and 7

Now we can list all unique 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (4, 8, 9)>
<3, (1, 4, 9)>
<9, (0, 5, 7)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars gives us [3].
