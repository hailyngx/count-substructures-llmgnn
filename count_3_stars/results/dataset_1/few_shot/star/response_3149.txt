Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars present. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we can see that the centers of the 3-stars can be nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8. We will now list out the unique 3-stars:

<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<7, (0, 5, 8)>

Therefore, there are a total of [2] 3-stars in the given graph.
