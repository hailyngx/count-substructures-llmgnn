Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 6

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 26 edges, let's identify the 3-star structures in the graph.

We need to find all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes forming a 3-star.

The 3-stars in the graph are:
<0, (5, 7, 5)>
<1, (9, 5, 9)>
<2, (3, 4, 5)>
<2, (4, 2, 5)>
<2, (5, 3, 4)>
<3, (2, 5, 4)>
<4, (2, 5, 3)>
<5, (0, 7, 5)>
<5, (2, 3, 4)>
<6, (5, 8, 6)>
<6, (8, 6, 9)>
<7, (5, 0, 5)>
<9, (1, 5, 9)>
<9, (6, 5, 6)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
