Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph:

There are a total of 10 nodes, so we will go through each node to see if it acts as the center of a 3-star.

1. For Node 0:
    - Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, and 8.
    - Nodes 1, 2, and 3 are connected to Node 0 forming a 3-star. 
    - So, Node 0 is the center of a 3-star with leaves 1, 2, and 3: <0, (1, 2, 3)>

2. For Node 1:
    - Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 5, and 8.
    - Nodes 0, 4, and 5 are connected to Node 1 forming a 3-star.
    - So, Node 1 is the center of a 3-star with leaves 0, 4, and 5: <1, (0, 4, 5)>

3. For Node 2:
    - Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, and 7.
    - Nodes 0, 3, and 4 are connected to Node 2, forming a 3-star.
    - So, Node 2 is the center of a 3-star with leaves 0, 3, and 4: <2, (0, 3, 4)>

4. For Node 3:
    - Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, 5, 8, and 9.
    - Nodes 0, 2, and 4 are connected to Node 3, forming a 3-star.
    - So, Node 3 is the center of a 3-star with leaves 0, 2, and 4: <3, (0, 2, 4)>
    - Nodes 3, 5, 8 are also connected to Node 4, forming another 3-star.
    - So, Node 3 is the center of a 3-star with leaves 5, 8, and 9: <3, (5, 8, 9)>

5. For Node 4:
    - Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, and 5.
    - Nodes 1, 2, and 3 are connected to Node 4, forming a 3-star.
    - So, Node 4 is the center of a 3-star with leaves 1, 2, and 3: <4, (1, 2, 3)>
    - Nodes 4 and 5 are also connected to Node 6, forming another 3-star.
    - So, Node 4 is the center of a 3-star with leaves 5 and 6: <4, (5, 6)>

6. For Node 5:
    - Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, and 6.
    - Nodes 1, 3, and 4 are connected to Node 5, forming a 3-star.
    - So, Node 5 is the center of a 3-star with leaves 1, 3, and 4: <5, (1, 3, 4)>
    - Nodes 5 and 6 are connected, forming another 3-star.
    - So, Node 5 is the center of a 3-star with leaves 4, 5, 6: <5, (4, 6)>

7. For Node 6:
    - Node 6 is connected to nodes 5 and 8.
    - Nodes 5 and 8 are connected to Node 6, forming a 3-star.
    - So, Node 6 is the center of a 3-star with leaves 5 and 8: <6, (5, 8)>

8. For Node 7:
    - Node 7 is only connected to Node 2 which doesn't form a 3-star.

9. For Node 8:
    - Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, 6, and 9.
    - Nodes 0, 3, and 9 are connected to Node 8, forming a 3-star.
    - So, Node 8 is the center of a 3-star with leaves 0, 3, and 9: <8, (0, 3, 9)>
    - Nodes 1, 6, and 9 are also connected to Node 8, forming another 3-star.
    - So, Node 8 is the center of a 3-star with leaves 1, 6, and 9: <8, (1, 6, 9)>

10. For Node 9:
    - Node 9 is connected to nodes 3 and 8.
    - Nodes 3 and 8 are connected to Node 9, forming a 3-star.
    - So, Node 9 is the center of a 3-star with leaves 3 and 8: <9, (3, 8)>

Count of 3-stars in the given graph: [9]
