Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern. A 3-star pattern consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we can identify the 3-stars as follows:

<0, (5, 8, 9)>
<1, (6, 7, empty)>
<2, (3, 6, empty)>
<3, (2, 5, 7)> 
<4, (5, 7, 8)>
<5, (0, 3, 4)>
<6, (1, 2, 8)>
<7, (1, 3, 4)>
<8, (0, 4, 6)>
<9, (0, 3, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
