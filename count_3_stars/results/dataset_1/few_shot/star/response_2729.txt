Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star pattern. 

Let's enumerate the 3-stars based on the given graph:

<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<4, (0, 3, 5)>
<6, (2, 4, 7)>
<7, (1, 3, 9)>

There are a total of [4] 3-stars in the given graph.
