Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the 3-stars present in the graph. 

Let's list down the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (1, 3, 6)>
<1, (0, 2, 6)>
<2, (1, 5, 6)>
<3, (0, 6, 8)>
<5, (1, 2, 8)>
<6, (0, 1, 2)>
<6, (2, 7, 9)>
<6, (6, 7, 9)>
<7, (6, 9, 9)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph:
[8]
