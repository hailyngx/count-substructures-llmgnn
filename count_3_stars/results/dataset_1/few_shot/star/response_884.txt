Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
There are 7 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
Therefore, the answer is [7].

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<2, (1, 6, 7)>
<3, (1, 5, 6)>
<4, (0, 1, 5)>
<5, (0, 1, 3)>
<6, (0, 2, 3)>
