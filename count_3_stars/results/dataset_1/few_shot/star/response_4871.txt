Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8)

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph can be identified by finding nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list them step by step:

1. Node 0 is a part of the following 3-stars:
   <0, (1, 3, 4)>
   <0, (1, 4, 6)>

2. Node 1 is not a part of any 3-star as it is connected to only 2 nodes.

3. Node 2 is not a part of any 3-star as it is connected to more than 3 nodes.

4. Node 3 is not a part of any 3-star as it is connected to only 2 nodes.

5. Node 4 is a part of the following 3-star:
   <4, (0, 1, 6)>

6. Node 5 is not a part of any 3-star as it is connected to only 2 nodes.

7. Node 6 is a part of the following 3-stars:
   <6, (0, 4, 1)>
   <6, (0, 4, 5)>
   <6, (0, 4, 7)>
   <6, (2, 8, 5)>
   <6, (2, 8, 7)>
   <6, (2, 8, 9)>

8. Node 7 is a part of the following 3-star:
   <7, (2, 3, 8)>

9. Node 8 is not a part of any 3-star as it is connected to more than 3 nodes.

10. Node 9 is not a part of any 3-star as it is connected to only 2 nodes.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7]. 

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (1, 3, 4)>, <0, (1, 4, 6)>, <4, (0, 1, 6)>, <6, (0, 4, 1)>, <6, (0, 4, 5)>, <6, (0, 4, 7)>, <6 (2, 8, 5)>, <6, (2, 8, 7)>, <6, (2, 8, 9)>, <7, (2, 3, 8)>.
