Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, 7, and node 8

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star configurations in the given graph:
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3 (forming a 3-star: <4, (1, 2, 3)>).
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 7 (forming a 3-star: <5, (2, 4, 7)>).
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 7 (forming a 3-star: <9, (1, 5, 7)>).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
