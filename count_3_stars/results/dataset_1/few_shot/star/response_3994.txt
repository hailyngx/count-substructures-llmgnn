Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (2, 6) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 3

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 

The 3-stars are:
<0, (6, 9)>
<2, (6, 0, 5)>
<3, (9, 0, 6)>
<4, (7, 6, 5)>
<5, (6, 0, 8)>
<6, (0, 2, 5)>
<7, (4, 6, 9)>
<8, (5, 6, 0)>
<9, (0, 3, 6)>

There are a total of [9] 3-stars in the graph.
