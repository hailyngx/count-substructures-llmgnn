Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 9

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars present in the graph.

Looking at the definition of a 3-star graph, we can see that a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 6, and 9 <0, (5, 6, 9)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 4, and 7 <1, (3, 4, 7)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 4, and 5 <3, (1, 4, 5)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 3, and 6 <5, (0, 3, 6)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 5, and 8 <6, (0, 5, 8)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 5, and 8 <7, (1, 5, 8)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 6, and 7 <8, (3, 6, 7)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 6, and 10 <9, (0, 6, 10)>

Therefore, there are 8 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
So, the final answer is [8].
