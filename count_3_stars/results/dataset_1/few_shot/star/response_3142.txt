Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Based on the adjacency list provided, we can identify the following unique 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<2, (1, 4, 9)>
<3, (1, 6, 9)>
<6, (0, 3, 7)>
<7, (0, 6, 9)>
<9, (2, 3, 7)>

Counting the unique 3-stars listed above, we find that there are a total of [7] 3-stars in the given graph.
