Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to find all occurrences of the pattern where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's analyze the given graph step-by-step:

1. Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 4, and 5: <0, (2, 4, 5)>
2. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 3, and 5: <1, (2, 3, 5)>
3. Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, and 4: <2, (0, 1, 4)>
4. Node 3 does not form a 3-star as it has only two connections.
5. Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 2, and 8: <4, (0, 2, 8)>
6. Node 5 does not form a 3-star as it has only two connections.
7. Node 6 does not form a 3-star as it has only one connection.
8. Node 7 does not form a 3-star as it has only two connections.
9. Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 4, and 7: <8, (2, 4, 7)>
10. Node 9 does not form a 3-star as it has only two connections.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4]. 

The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (2, 4, 5)>, <1, (2, 3, 5)>, <2, (0, 1, 4)>, <4, (0, 2, 8)>, <8, (2, 4, 7)>.
