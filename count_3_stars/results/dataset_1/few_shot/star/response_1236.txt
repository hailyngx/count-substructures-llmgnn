Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for nodes that have exactly three neighbors, as these nodes can act as centers of 3-stars. Let's examine the adjacency list to identify such nodes:

- Node 2: has 2 neighbors
- Node 6: has 1 neighbor
- Node 8: has 2 neighbors

Nodes that have exactly three neighbors:
- Node 0: connected to 4 neighbors (1, 3, 4, 9)
- Node 7: connected to 5 neighbors (1, 2, 6, 8, 9)

Now let's construct the 3-stars:
- Node 0 is the center of a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, and 4. <0, (1, 3, 4)>
- Node 7 is the center of a 3-star with nodes 1, 8, and 9. <7, (1, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
