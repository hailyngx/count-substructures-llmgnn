Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern. 

Since a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Here are the 3-stars found in the given graph:
<0, (6, 7, 8)>
<1, (4, 6, 8)>
<3, (4, 6, 9)>
<4, (1, 3, 7)>
<5, (7, 8)>
<8, (0, 1, 5)>

Count of 3-stars: [6]
