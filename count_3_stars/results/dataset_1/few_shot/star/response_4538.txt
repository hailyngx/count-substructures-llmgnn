Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 7

Response:
Let's first identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph:

1. <0, (2, 6, 7)>
2. <0, (2, 6, 9)>
3. <0, (6, 7, 9)>
4. <2, (0, 8, 9)>
5. <2, (8, 4, 5)>
6. <3, (1, 5, 9)>
7. <4, (1, 5, 8)>
8. <5, (3, 4, 6)>
9. <5, (4, 8, 6)>
10. <5, (3, 6, 8)>
11. <5, (3, 8, 6)>
12. <6, (0, 5, 8)>
13. <8, (2, 5, 7)>
14. <8, (2, 5, 4)>
15. <8, (7, 4, 5)>
16. <8, (7, 4, 6)>
17. <8, (2, 4, 5)>
18. <9, (0, 2, 3)>
19. <9, (0, 2, 7)>
20. <9, (0, 3, 7)>
21. <9, (0, 3, 2)>
22. <9, (7, 0, 2)>
23. <9, (7, 0, 3)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph:
