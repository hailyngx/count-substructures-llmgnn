Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that can act as the center of a 3-star, and then check if it is indeed connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's go through each node:
- Node 0: Not a center for any 3-star since it is connected to 3 nodes.
- Node 1: Potential for a 3-star (1, 2, 4, 9) or (1, 2, 8, 9).
- Node 2: Not a center for any 3-star since it is connected to 2 nodes.
- Node 3: Not a center for any 3-star since it is connected to 3 nodes.
- Node 4: Potential for a 3-star (4, 6, 7, 1).
- Node 5: Potential for a 3-star (5, 9, 1, 4) or (5, 9, 1, 8).
- Node 6: Not a center for any 3-star since it is connected to 3 nodes.
- Node 7: Not a center for any 3-star since it is connected to 3 nodes.
- Node 8: Not a center for any 3-star since it is connected to 3 nodes.
- Node 9: Not a center for any 3-star since it is connected to 2 nodes.

Therefore, the 3-stars in the given graph are:
<1, 2, 4, 9>
<4, 6, 7, 1>
<5, 9, 1, 4>
<5, 9, 1, 8>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
