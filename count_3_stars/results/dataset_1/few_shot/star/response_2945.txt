Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 5, and node 8

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to look for each node that serves as the center of a 3-star. A 3-star is formed when a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Here are the 3-stars in this graph:
[4]

<0, (2, 5, 7)>
<1, (2, 3, 6)>
<2, (0, 1, 5)>
<3, (1, 4, 5)>
<5, (0, 2, 3)>
<7, (0, 1, 4)>
<8, (0, 4, 9)>
<9, (0, 3, 8)>
