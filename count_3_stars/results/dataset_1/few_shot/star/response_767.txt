Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern.

Looking at the adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (4, 7, 9)>
<1, (4, 5, 9)>
<2, (3, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
