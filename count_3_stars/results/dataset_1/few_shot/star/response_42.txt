Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 5, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes. Let's identify the 3-star structures in the graph:

1. <0, (3, 7, 8)>
2. <4, (1, 3, 9)>
3. <7, (0, 8, 9)>
4. <9, (2, 5, 7)>
5. <8, (7, 9, -)>

Count = 5

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
