Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 3
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars, we need to find all the instances where a node has exactly three neighbors forming a 3-star with it as the center node. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we can see that the nodes which can potentially be center nodes for 3-stars are nodes 0, 2, 3, 6, and 8 since they each have exactly three neighbors.

Let's list down the unique 3-stars that we find in the graph:

<0, (5, 6, 2)>
<2, (1, 3, 5)>
<3, (1, 2, 5)>
<5, (0, 2, 3)>
<6, (0, 7, 5)>
<7, (6, 5, 8)>
<8, (3, 7, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
