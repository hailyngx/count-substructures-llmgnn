Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first note that a 3-star involves one central node and three connected leaf nodes. We will examine each node to determine if it is the center of a 3-star and then list the unique 3-stars found.

Let's go through each node and identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 0: Not a central node of a 3-star.
2. Node 1: <1, (5, 9, 0)>
3. Node 2: <2, (4, 8, 9)>
4. Node 3: Not a central node of a 3-star.
5. Node 4: <4, (2, 7, 9)> and <4, (7, 2, 8)>
6. Node 5: <5, (1, 6, 8)> and <5, (6, 1, 3)>
7. Node 6: <6, (3, 5, 8)>
8. Node 7: Not a central node of a 3-star.
9. Node 8: <8, (2, 5, 9)>
10. Node 9: Not a central node of a 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: 
<1, (5, 9, 0)>
<2, (4, 8, 9)>
<4, (2, 7, 9)>
<4, (7, 2, 8)>
<5, (1, 6, 8)>
<5, (6, 1, 3)>
<6, (3, 5, 8)>
