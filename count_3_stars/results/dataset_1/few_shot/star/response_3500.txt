Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the unique instances where a center node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Given the graph information, we can see the following 3-stars:
<2, (0, 3, 4)>
<4, (2, 3, 5)>
<7, (2, 5, 9)>
<9, (1, 4, 7)>

Now, we count the number of unique 3-stars found to get the final answer:

[4]
