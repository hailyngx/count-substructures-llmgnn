Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7)

Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will need to identify all the unique occurrences of a central node connected to three other nodes. Let's go step-by-step:

Step 1: Identify all nodes that satisfy the definition of a 3-star (central node connected to exactly three other nodes):
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 6, and 9 (forms a 3-star: <0, (2, 6, 9)>)
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 8 (forms a 3-star: <1, (2, 4, 8)>)
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 5, 7, and 8, but only <0, (2, 6, 9)> and <1, (2, 4, 8)> qualify as 3-stars with center 2.
- Node 3, Node 4, Node 5, and Node 8 do not meet the criteria for being the center of a 3-star.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 7, 8, and 9, forming two 3-stars: <0, (2, 6, 9)> and <6, (0, 3, 7)>.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 5, 6, and 9, but <6, (0, 3, 7)> is the only 3-star with center 7.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7, forming one 3-star: <0, (2, 6, 9)>.

Step 2: Count the total number of unique 3-stars identified in Step 1 and represent them inside <>:
- <0, (2, 6, 9)>
- <1, (2, 4, 8)>
- <6, (0, 3, 7)>

Finally, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
