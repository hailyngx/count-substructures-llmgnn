Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 3

Response:
Considering the definition of a 3-star graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the provided information:
- Node 0 is connected to 3 other nodes: 2, 3, and 7.
- Node 3 is connected to 3 other nodes: 0, 2, and 4.
- Node 5 is connected to 3 other nodes: 3, 4, and 6.
- Node 8 is connected to 3 other nodes: 2, 5, and 7.

Therefore, we have found the following unique 3-stars: 
<0, (2, 3, 7)>
<3, (0, 2, 4)>
<5, (3, 4, 6)>
<8, (2, 5, 7)>

Finally, we count the total number of 3-stars in the graph: [4].
