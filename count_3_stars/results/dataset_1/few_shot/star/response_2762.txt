Response:
Let's find the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

The central node of a 3-star can be any node that has at least 3 neighbors. The possible central nodes in this graph are: 0, 1, 4, 7, and 9.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each central node:

For central node 0:
- Possible 3-stars: {0, 1, 7}, {0, 2, 9}, {0, 7, 9}
- Number of 3-stars with central node 0: 3

For central node 1:
- Possible 3-stars: {1, 0, 9}
- Number of 3-stars with central node 1: 1

For central node 4:
- Possible 3-stars: {4, 7, 9}
- Number of 3-stars with central node 4: 1

For central node 7:
- Possible 3-stars: {7, 0, 4}, {7, 6, 8}
- Number of 3-stars with central node 7: 2

For central node 9:
- Possible 3-stars: {9, 0, 5}, {9, 1, 4}, {9, 5, 0}
- Number of 3-stars with central node 9: 3

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10]. 

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (1, 7, 9)>
<1, (0, 9)>
<4, (7, 9)>
<7, (0, 4)>
<7, (6, 8)>
<9, (0, 5)>
<9, (1, 4)>
<9, (5, 0)>
