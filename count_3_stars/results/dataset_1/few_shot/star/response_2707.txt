Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 2

Response:
First, let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:
Since a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can identify them by looking for nodes that have exactly three neighbors.

In this graph:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors (0, 7, 9) - <2, (0, 7, 9)>
- Node 3 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 0 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 0 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 1 neighbor.

Therefore, there is one 3-star in the given graph: <2, (0, 7, 9)>.

The number of 3-stars in the graph: [1]
