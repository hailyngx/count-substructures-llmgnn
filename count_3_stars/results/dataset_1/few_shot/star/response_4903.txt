Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the 3-stars. Since each 3-star has a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can start by listing the central nodes and their neighbors:

Central Node 0: 1, 2, 4
Central Node 1: 0, 3, 6
Central Node 2: 0, 3, 6
Central Node 3: 1, 2
Central Node 4: 0, 6, 7
Central Node 5: 8
Central Node 6: 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 9
Central Node 7: 1, 4, 6
Central Node 8: 0, 5, 6, 7
Central Node 9: 6

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph. To do this, we can consider each central node and its neighbors to form 3-stars. After examining the connections, we can see that only 3-stars can be formed as follows:
