Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 1

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star pattern.

Looking at the adjacency list and given edges, we can see that the possible 3-stars in this graph are:
<1, (9, 0, 0)>
<2, (3, 3, 6)>
<3, (2, 6, 6)>
<5, (3, 4, 7)>
<6, (2, 3, 7)>
<7, (5, 6, 5)>
<9, (1, 0, 0)>

There are a total of [7] unique 3-stars in the graph.
