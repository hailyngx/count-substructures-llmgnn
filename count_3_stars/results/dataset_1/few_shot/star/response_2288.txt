Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. We will look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes and check if these connections form a 3-star around the central node. 

Since the graph has 10 nodes, we will examine each node to see if it forms a 3-star. 

Let's go through each node:
- Node 0 is not a part of any 3-star as it is connected to 0, 5, and 9.
- Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
- Node 2 forms a 3-star <2, (3, 6, 9)>.
- Node 3 forms a 3-star <3, (2, 6, 7)>.
- Node 4 does not form any 3-stars.
- Node 5 does not form any 3-stars.
- Node 6 forms a 3-star <6, (2, 3, 7)>.
- Node 7 forms a 3-star <7, (3, 4, 6)>.
- Node 8 does not form any 3-stars.
- Node 9 does not form any 3-stars.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

Unique 3-stars found:
<2, (3, 6, 9)>
<3, (2, 6, 7)>
<6, (2, 3, 7)>
<7, (3, 4, 6)>
