Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. We will go through each node and check if it forms a 3-star. Let's identify the unique 3-stars:

<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<0, (3, 4, 8)>
<0, (4, 6, 8)>
<3, (0, 6, 8)>
<4, (0, 2, 8)>
<4, (0, 7, 8)>
<6, (0, 3, 8)>
<8, (4, 6, 7)>

Count of 3-stars: [9]
