Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a 3-star pattern.

Let's go step by step:

1. Node 0: Forms 3-stars with (6, 4, 7) and (8, 4, 7)
2. Node 1: No 3-stars
3. Node 2: No 3-stars
4. Node 3: No 3-stars
5. Node 4: No 3-stars
6. Node 5: No 3-stars
7. Node 6: Forms 3-stars with (0, 4, 8) and (2, 4, 6)
8. Node 7: No 3-stars
9. Node 8: No 3-stars
10. Node 9: No 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: [4]

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (6, 4, 7)>
<0, (8, 4, 7)>
<6, (0, 4, 8)>
<6, (2, 4, 6)>
