Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for patterns where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star structure. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (3, 4, 8)>
<1, (6, 7, 8)>
<3, (0, 8, 9)>
<7, (1, 8, 9)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars.
