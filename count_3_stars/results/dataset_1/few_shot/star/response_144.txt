Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 5
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for each node that has exactly 3 neighbors, and then check if it forms a 3-star. 

In this graph, only Node 1 and Node 3 have 3 neighbors. Let's examine each potential 3-star centered at Node 1 and Node 3.

For Node 1:
- <1, (3, 5, 6)>
- <1, (3, 5, 7)>
- <1, (3, 5, 8)>
- <1, (3, 6, 7)>
- <1, (3, 6, 8)>
- <1, (3, 7, 8)>
- <1, (5, 6, 7)>
- <1, (5, 6, 8)>
- <1, (5, 7, 8)>
- There are a total of 9 unique 3-stars centered at Node 1.

For Node 3:
- <3, (1, 4, 7)>
- <3, (1, 5, 7)>
- <3, (1, 5, 8)>
- There are a total of 3 unique 3-stars centered at Node 3.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
