Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the central nodes and their adjacent nodes. 

Looking at the adjacency list, each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes forms a 3-star. Let's list the 3-stars found in the graph:

<1, (3, 4, 6)>
<4, (1, 2, 7)>
<6, (1, 3, 9)>
<7, (1, 4, 8)>
<8, (1, 2, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
