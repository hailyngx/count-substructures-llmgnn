Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 4

Response:
There are a total of 3 3-star structures in the given graph, as shown below: 
- <0, (2, 6, 9)>
- <1, (4, 5, 6)>
- <4, (1, 5, 9)>

Therefore, the final answer is [3].
