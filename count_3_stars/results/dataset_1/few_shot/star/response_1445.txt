Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 7, and node 8

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 5, 6, and 7:
   <2, (0, 5, 6)>
   <2, (0, 5, 7)>

2. Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 7, and 9:
   <3, (4, 5, 7)>
   <3, (4, 5, 9)>
   <3, (4, 7, 9)>
   <3, (5, 7, 9)>

3. Node 4 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 8:
   <4, (3, 5, 8)>

4. Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 4:
   <5, (2, 3, 4)>

5. Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 9:
   <7, (2, 3, 9)>

6. Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 7, and 8:
   <9, (1, 3, 7)>
   <9, (1, 3, 8)>
   <9, (1, 7, 8)>

Therefore, there are a total of [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
