Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 1) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we must identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through each node and determine if it forms a 3-star.

The possible 3-stars are as follows:
<1, (4, 5, 6)>
<1, (4, 5, 8)>
<1, (4, 5, 9)>
<1, (4, 6, 8)>
<1, (4, 6, 9)>
<1, (4, 8, 9)>
<1, (5, 6, 8)>
<1, (5, 6, 9)>
<1, (5, 8, 9)>

[Total number of 3-stars: 9]
