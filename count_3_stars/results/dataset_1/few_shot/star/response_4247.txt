Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 3) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars. 

Based on the definition of a 3-star, we look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

After examining the graph, we find the following 3-stars:
<0, (6, 8, 0)>
<1, (3, 5, 6)>
<2, (7, 9, 2)>
<3, (1, 4, 3)>
<7, (1, 2, 9)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
