Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to understand that a 3-star is formed by a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

In this case, we can see that the central nodes are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 since they have three connections each. 

Let's identify the 3-stars one by one:

<0, (4, 5, 8)>
<1, (3, 5, 7)>
<2, (5, 6, 7)>
<3, (1, 6, 7)>
<4, (0, 8, 5)>
<5, (0, 1, 2)>
<6, (2, 3, 7)>
<7, (2, 3, 8)>
<8, (4, 7, 0)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we find that there are [9] 3-stars. 

Therefore, the final answer is [9].
