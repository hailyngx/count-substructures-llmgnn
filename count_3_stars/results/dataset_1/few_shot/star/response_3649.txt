Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 9) (8, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 6

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

- From the adjacency list, we can see the connections for each node.
- Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. <1, (2, 4)>  
2. <3, (0, 4, 5)>  
3. <4, (1, 3, 8)>
