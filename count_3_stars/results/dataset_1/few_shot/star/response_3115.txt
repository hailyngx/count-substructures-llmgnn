Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 6

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star-like configuration. 

Let's go through each node and its connections to identify the 3-stars:

- Node 1 is connected to nodes 7, which forms a 3-star: <1, (7, 2, 8)>
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 7, which forms a 3-star: <2, (7, 1, 8)>
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 8, and 9, which forms a 3-star: <3, (4, 8, 9)>
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 9, which forms a 3-star: <6, (9, 3, 4)>
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 8, which forms two 3-stars: <7, (1, 2, 8)> and <7, (1, 2, 9)>
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 3 and 7, which forms two 3-stars: <8, (3, 7, 1)> and <8, (3, 7, 2)>
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 3 and 6, which forms a 3-star: <9, (3, 8, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
