Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify sets of nodes that form 3-stars. A 3-star involves a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Looking at the adjacency list, we can see that the possible central nodes for 3-stars are nodes 2, 3, 6, 7, and 8 since they each have exactly three connections. Let's list the unique 3-stars found:

<2, (3, 4, 6)>
<3, (2, 7, 9)>
<6, (2, 5, 8)>
<7, (3, 5, 9)>

Count of 3-stars: [4]
