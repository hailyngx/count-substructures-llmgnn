Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify all unique 3-stars in the graph. 

Starting with the adjacency list, we can see that the nodes and their connections are as follows:
- Node 0: {1, 7, 8}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 2: {1, 4, 7}
- Node 3: {1, 7}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 7}
- Node 5: {7, 8}
- Node 6: {1, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
- Node 8: {0, 5}
- Node 9: {6}

Now, let's go through each node and identify the 3-stars:

- Node 0: No 3-star, as it does not have 3 connected nodes.
- Node 1: <1, (0, 7, 4)>, <1, (2, 4, 7)>
- Node 2: <2, (1, 4, 7)>
- Node 3: No 3-star, as it does not have 3 connected nodes.
- Node 4: No 3-star, as it does not have 3 connected nodes.
- Node 5: No 3-star, as it does not have 3 connected nodes.
- Node 6: No 3-star, as it does not have 3 connected nodes.
- Node 7: <7, (0, 1, 4)>
- Node 8: No 3-star, as it does not have 3 connected nodes.
- Node 9: No 3-star, as it does not have 3 connected nodes.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4] and they are <1, (0, 7, 4)>, <1, (2, 4, 7)>, <2, (1, 4, 7)>, <7, (0, 1, 4)>.
