Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 5
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 1

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern. 

Let's analyze each node to find the 3-stars: 

- Node 0: <0, (2, 5)> (1 star)
- Node 1: <1, (2, 9)> (1 star)
- Node 2: <2, (0, 1)> (1 star)
- Node 3: No 3-stars
- Node 4: <4, (3, 5, 7)> (1 star)
- Node 5: <5, (0, 4, 7)> (1 star)
- Node 6: No 3-stars
- Node 7: No 3-stars
- Node 8: No 3-stars
- Node 9: No 3-stars

Count of 3-stars: 3
Unique 3-stars: 
<0, (2, 5)>
<1, (2, 9)>
<4, (3, 5, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
