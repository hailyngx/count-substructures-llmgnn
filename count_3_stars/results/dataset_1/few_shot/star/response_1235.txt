Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph provided, we can look at each node and its neighbors to see if there are any 3-stars centered at that node. 

For this graph with 10 nodes:
1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 7, and 9.
   - <0, (1, 2, 7)>
   - <0, (1, 2, 9)>
   - <0, (2, 7, 9)>
   [3]

2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 6.
   - <1, (0, 2, 6)>
   [1]

3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, and 9.
   - <2, (0, 1, 3)>
   - <2, (0, 1, 9)>
   [2]

4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 2 and 6.
   [0]

5. Node 4 is connected to node 5.
   [0]

6. Node 5 is connected to node 4.
   [0]

7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 8.
   - <6, (1, 3, 8)>
   [1]

8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 8, and 9.
   - <7, (0, 8, 9)>
   [1]

9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 6 and 7.
   [0]

10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 7.
   - <9, (0, 2, 7)>
   [1]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
