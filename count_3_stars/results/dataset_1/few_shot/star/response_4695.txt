Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify all possible configurations where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes (forming a 3-star).

Looking at the adjacency list, we can identify the 3-stars as follows:
<0, (1, 7, 9)>
<1, (0, 7, 9)>
<2, (0, 3, 5)>
<3, (0, 2, 9)>
<4, (0, 5, 7)>
<5, (0, 2, 7)>
<7, (0, 1, 5)>
<9, (0, 1, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
