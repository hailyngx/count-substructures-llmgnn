Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 8

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 4, 2, and 6: <1, (2, 4, 6)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 1, 4, and 8: <2, (1, 4, 8)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 1, 2, and 5: <8, (1, 2, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
