Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes (forming a 3-star pattern).

Looking at the graph provided:
- Node 0 is not connected to exactly three other nodes.
- Node 1 is not connected to exactly three other nodes.
- Node 2 is connected to exactly three other nodes: 1, 7, 8.
  This forms a 3-star: <2, (1, 7, 8)>.
- Node 3 is not connected to exactly three other nodes.
- Node 4 is not connected to exactly three other nodes.
- Node 5 is not connected to exactly three other nodes.
- Node 6 is not connected to exactly three other nodes.
- Node 7 is not connected to exactly three other nodes.
- Node 8 is not connected to exactly three other nodes.
- Node 9 is not connected to exactly three other nodes.

Therefore, there is only 1 unique 3-star in the given graph: <2, (1, 7, 8)>.
