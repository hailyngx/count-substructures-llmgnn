Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all possible 3-stars. 

Starting from the center node and moving outward, we can identify the following 3-stars based on the given edges:
- <0, (2, 8, 9)>
- <2, (0, 8, 9)>
- <6, (3, 5, 8)>
- <8, (0, 6, 9)>
- <9, (1, 4, 8)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars.
