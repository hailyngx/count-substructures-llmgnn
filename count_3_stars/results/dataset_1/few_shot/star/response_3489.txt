Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 5, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the unique 3-stars that exist in the graph.

Here are the unique 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<1, (0, 4, 5)>
<2, (9, 5, 7)>
<3, (4, 6, 0)>
<4, (0, 1, 6)>
<5, (0, 1, 6)>
<6, (0, 3, 4)>
<7, (5, 6, 9)>
<8, (9, 2, 5)>
<9, (2, 5, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
