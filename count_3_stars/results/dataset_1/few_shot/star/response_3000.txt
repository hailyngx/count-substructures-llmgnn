Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Looking at the adjacency list, we can see that the central nodes are: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

Let's find the 3-stars in the graph:

1. For central node 0:
   - Node 0 is connected to nodes 3 and 6.
   <0, (3, 6)>

2. For central node 1:
   - Node 1 is connected to nodes 5, 7, 8, and 9.
   <1, (5, 7, 8)>
   <1, (5, 7, 9)>
   <1, (5, 8, 9)>
   <1, (7, 8, 9)>

3. For central node 3:
   - Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 5, and 6.
   <3, (0, 4, 5)>
   <3, (0, 4, 6)>
   <3, (0, 5, 6)>
   <3, (4, 5, 6)>

4. For central node 4:
   - Node 4 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 8, and 9.
   <4, (3, 5, 8)>
   <4, (3, 5, 9)>
   <4, (3, 8, 9)>
   <4, (5, 8, 9)>

5. For central node 5:
   - Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, and 9.
   <5, (1, 3, 4)>
   <5, (1, 3, 6)>
   <5, (1, 3, 7)>
   <5, (1, 3, 9)>
   <5, (1, 4, 6)>
   <5, (1, 4, 7)>
   <5, (1, 4, 9)>
   <5, (1, 6, 7)>
   <5, (1, 6, 9)>
   <5, (1, 7, 9)>
   <5, (3, 4, 6)>
   <5, (3, 4, 7)>
   <5, (3, 4, 9)>
   <5, (3, 6, 7)>
   <5, (3, 6, 9)>
   <5, (3, 7, 9)>
   <5, (4, 6, 7)>
   <5, (4, 6, 9)>
   <5, (4, 7, 9)>
   <5, (6, 7, 9)>

6. For central node 6:
   - Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 5, 8, and 9.
   <6, (0, 3, 5)>
   <6, (0, 3, 8)>
   <6, (0, 3, 9)>
   <6, (0, 5, 8)>
   <6, (0, 5, 9)>
   <6, (0, 8, 9)>
   <6, (3, 5, 8)>
   <6, (3, 5, 9)>
   <6, (3, 8, 9)>
   <6, (5, 8, 9)>

7. For central node 7:
   - Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 5, and 8.
   <7, (1, 3, 5)>
   <7, (1, 3, 8)>
   <7, (1, 5, 8)>
   <7, (3, 5, 8)>

8. For central node 8:
   - Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 6, and 7.
   <8, (1, 4, 6)>
   <8, (1, 4, 7)>
   <8, (1, 6, 7)>
   <8, (4, 6, 7)>

9. For central node 9:
   - Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 5, and 6.
   <9, (1, 4, 5)>
   <9, (1, 4, 6)>
   <9, (1, 5, 6)>
   <9, (4, 5, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [33].
