Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 4

Response:
Based on the given information, we can find the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 0 forms a 3-star: <0, (1, 7, 9)>
- Node 1 forms three 3-stars: <1, (0, 5, 6)>, <1, (7, 0, 9)>, <1, (5, 2, 7)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star: <3, (0, 6, 7)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star: <4, (7, 8, 9)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star: <5, (1, 2, 7)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star: <6, (1, 3, 7)>
- Node 7 forms six 3-stars: <7, (0, 1, 3)>, <7, (1, 0, 9)>, <7, (3, 0, 6)>, <7, (4, 5, 6)>, <7, (5, 1, 8)>, <7, (6, 1, 3)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star: <9, (0, 1, 4)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
