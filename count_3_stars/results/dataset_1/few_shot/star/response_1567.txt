Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 6

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star pattern. 

Let's go through each node to find the 3-stars:
- Node 0 is a center of a 3-star with nodes 6, 7, and 8. <0, (6, 7, 8)>
- Node 1 is not part of any 3-star because it is connected to 4 and 5, and 7. 
- Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes, so it cannot be part of a 3-star.
- Node 3 is a center of a 3-star with nodes 4, 5, and 6. <3, (4, 5, 6)>
- Node 4 is not part of any 3-star because it is connected to 1, 3, and 8.
- Node 5 is not part of any 3-star because it is connected to 1, and 3.
- Node 6 is a center of a 3-star with nodes 0, 3, and 9. <6, (0, 3, 9)>
- Node 7 is a center of a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, and 3. <7, (0, 1, 3)>
- Node 8 is not part of any 3-star because it is connected to 0, and 4.
- Node 9 is not part of any 3-star because it is connected to 3, and 6.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (6, 7, 8)>, <3, (4, 5, 6)>, <6, (0, 3, 9)>, <7, (0, 1, 3)>.
