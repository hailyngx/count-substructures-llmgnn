Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible 3-stars based on the definition provided. 

First, let's identify the central nodes in the graph. Central nodes are nodes with exactly three edges. In this graph, nodes 0, 7, and 8 are central nodes.

Now, let's find all possible 3-stars. 

1. For central node 0:
    - <0, (5, 6, 8)>
    - <0, (5, 6, 9)>
    - <0, (5, 8, 9)>
    - <0, (6, 8, 9)>

2. For central node 7:
    - <7, (1, 5, 6)>
    - <7, (1, 6, 8)>
    - <7, (5, 6, 8)>
    - <7, (6, 8, 9)>

3. For central node 8:
    - <8, (0, 7, 9)>
    - <8, (7, 9, 6)>
    - <8, (9, 6, 0)>
    
Counting the unique 3-stars found above, we get a total of [7]. So, the final answer is [7].
