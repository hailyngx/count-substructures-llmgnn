Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 6

Response:
Based on the given information, the 3-stars in the graph are as follows:

<0, (6, 7, 8)>
<1, (5, 7, 8)>
<2, (6, 8, 5)>
<5, (1, 8, 0)>
<6, (0, 2, 9)>
<8, (0, 1, 2)>

Count of 3-stars: [6]
