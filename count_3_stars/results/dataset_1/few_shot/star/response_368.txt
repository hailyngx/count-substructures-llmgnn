Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars, we need to identify all unique configurations where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through the nodes one by one to find all the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<0, (4, 5, 8)>
<2, (0, 5, 9)>
<4, (0, 5, 6)>
<5, (0, 2, 8)>
<8, (0, 1, 5)>
<9, (0, 2, 6)>

Counting the unique 3-stars found above, we get a total of [7].
