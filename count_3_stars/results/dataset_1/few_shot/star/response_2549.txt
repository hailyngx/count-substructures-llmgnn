Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all possible 3-stars. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.
Here are the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (1, 7, 8)>
<0, (1, 7, 9)>
<0, (1, 8, 9)>
<0, (7, 8, 9)>
<1, (0, 6, 7)>
<3, (7, 8, 9)>
<4, (5, 8, 9)>
<5, (4, 8, 9)>
<7, (0, 3, 9)>
<8, (0, 5, 9)>
<8, (3, 5, 9)>
<9, (0, 7, 8)>

Count of 3-stars: [12]
