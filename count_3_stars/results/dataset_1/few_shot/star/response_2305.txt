Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 9) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 7

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (1, 3, 6)>
<1, (0, 4, 5)>
<3, (0, 4, 6)>
<4, (1, 3, 5)>
<5, (1, 4)>
<6, (0, 3, 4)>
<7, (2, 9)>
<9, (3, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
