Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 8

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (2, 4, 6)>
2. Node 3 forms a 3-star: <3, (0, 7, 8)>
3. Node 5 forms a 3-star: <5, (6, 8, 0)>
4. Node 7 forms a 3-star: <7, (8, 1, 3)>
5. Node 8 forms a 3-star: <8, (5, 7, 3)>

So, there are a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
