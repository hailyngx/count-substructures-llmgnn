Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 8

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 1: (1, 2, 5), (1, 3, 8)
2. Node 2: (2, 1, 5), (2, 8, 1)
3. Node 3: (3, 1, 8), (3, 4, 8)
4. Node 4: (4, 3, 8)
5. Node 5: (5, 1, 2), (5, 3, 7)
6. Node 8: (8, 1, 3), (8, 2, 1), (8, 3, 4), (8, 4, 1), (8, 9, 0)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [11]. 

The unique 3-stars are <1, (2, 5, 3)>, <1, (3, 8, 2)>, <3, (1, 8, 4)>, <5, (2, 1, 3)>, <5, (3, 7, 1)>, and <8, (1, 3, 4)>.
