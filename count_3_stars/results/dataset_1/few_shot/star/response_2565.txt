Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 7

Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 7

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for each possible central node and count the number of 3-stars around it. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's find all the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 0: No 3-star as it is connected to only 2 nodes.
2. Node 1: No 3-star as it is connected to only 1 node.
3. Node 2: <2, (4, 5, 7)>
4. Node 3: <3, (4, 8, 9)>
5. Node 4: No 3-star as it is connected to 4 nodes.
6. Node 5: No 3-star as it is connected to only 2 nodes.
7. Node 6: No 3-star as it is connected to only 2 nodes.
8. Node 7: <7, (0, 2, 4)> and <7, (6, 8, 9)>
9. Node 8: No 3-star as it is connected to only 3 nodes.
10. Node 9: No 3-star as it is connected to only 2 nodes.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3]. 

Unique 3-stars found:
<2, (4, 5, 7)>
<3, (4, 8, 9)>
<7, (0, 2, 4)>
<7, (6, 8, 9)>
