Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (2, 6, 7)>
<1, (4, 5, 8)>
<2, (0, 3, 4)>
<3, (2, 5, 6)>
<4, (1, 2, 9)>
<5, (1, 3, 6)>
<7, (0, 2, 5)>
<8, (1, 7)>
<9, (4)>

Count of 3-stars: [9]
