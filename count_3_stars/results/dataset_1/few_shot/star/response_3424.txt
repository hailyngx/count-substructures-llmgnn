Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 0

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are as follows:

- <0, (2, 3, 9)>
- <1, (6, 7, 5)>
- <2, (0, 3, 7)>
- <3, (0, 2, 7)>
- <5, (6, 7, 5)>
- <6, (1, 7, 5)>
- <7, (1, 2, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [7].
