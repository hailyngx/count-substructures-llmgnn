Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 3) (3, 2) (4, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that has exactly three neighbors and check if it forms a 3-star. 

Examining each node:
- Node 0 has neighbors 1, 6, 9 (forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 6, 9)
- Node 1 has neighbors 0, 8 (does not form a 3-star)
- Node 2 has neighbor 3 (does not form a 3-star)
- Node 3 has neighbor 2 (does not form a 3-star)
- Node 4 has neighbor 6 (does not form a 3-star)
- Node 5 has neighbor 7 (does not form a 3-star)
- Node 6 has neighbors 0, 4, 8, 9 (forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 8, 9 and another with nodes 0, 4, 9)
- Node 7 has neighbor 5 (does not form a 3-star)
- Node 8 has neighbors 1, 6, 9 (forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 6, 9)
- Node 9 has neighbors 0, 6, 8 (forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 6, 8)

Based on the above analysis, the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 6, 9)> 
<6, (0, 4, 8)>
<8, (1, 6, 9)>
<9, (0, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
