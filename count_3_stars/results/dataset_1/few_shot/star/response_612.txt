Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars step by step:

1. Node 1 is a part of <1, (3, 7, 0)>.
2. Node 2 is not part of any 3-star as it is connected to 4 nodes.
3. Node 3 is a part of <3, (1, 2, 6)> and <3, (1, 2, 7)>.
4. Node 4 is not part of any 3-star as it is connected to 2 nodes.
5. Node 5 is a part of <5, (2, 3, 6)>.
6. Node 6 is a part of <6, (3, 5, 9)> and <6, (3, 5, 0)>.
7. Node 7 is a part of <7, (1, 3, 4)> and <7, (1, 3, 9)>.
8. Node 8 is not part of any 3-star as it is connected to 1 node.
9. Node 9 is a part of <9, (4, 6, 7)> and <9, (4, 6, 0)>.

Count of 3-stars: [6]
Unique 3-stars:
<1, (3, 7, 0)>
<3, (1, 2, 6)>
<3, (1, 2, 7)>
<5, (2, 3, 6)>
<6, (3, 5, 9)>
<7, (1, 3, 4)>
<7, (1, 3, 9)>
<9, (4, 6, 7)>
<9, (4, 6, 0)>
