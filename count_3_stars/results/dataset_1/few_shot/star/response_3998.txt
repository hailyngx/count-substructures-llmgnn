Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 7

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the graph. Central nodes are nodes that have exactly three neighbors. 
Looking at the adjacency list:
- Node 2 is a central node with 3 neighbors (1, 4, 6)
- Node 6 is a central node with 3 neighbors (2, 5, 9)
- Node 7 is a central node with 3 neighbors (1, 8, 9)
- Node 8 is a central node with 3 neighbors (1, 4, 5)

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph. 
For each central node, we will check its neighbors to form 3-star configurations.

For Node 2:
- (2, 1, 4)
- (2, 1, 6)

For Node 6:
- (6, 2, 5)
- (6, 2, 9)

For Node 7:
- (7, 1, 8)
- (7, 1, 9)

For Node 8:
- (8, 1, 4)
- (8, 1, 5)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
<2, (1, 4, 6)>
<6, (2, 5, 9)>
<7, (1, 8, 9)>
<8, (1, 4, 5)>
