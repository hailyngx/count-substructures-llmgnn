Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 6, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: Identify Nodes with 3 Edges
- Nodes 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 8 have 3 or more edges connected to them.

Step 2: Count 3-Stars from Nodes with 3 Edges
- Start from each node with exactly 3 edges connected to it and check if they form a 3-star.
- Count the number of 3-stars accordingly.

Step 3: Determine the Total Number of 3-Stars
- Sum up the 3-stars found from all the nodes with 3 edges.

Let's proceed with Step 2 to count the 3-stars.
