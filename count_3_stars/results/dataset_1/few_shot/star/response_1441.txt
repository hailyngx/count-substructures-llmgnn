Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 2) (8, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 5

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Given the information provided, we can list the unique 3-stars as follows:
<0, (1, 2, 6)>
<2, (0, 3, 7)>
<2, (0, 3, 8)>
<2, (3, 7, 8)>
<3, (2, 4, 9)>
<4, (3, 6, 9)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we get a total of [6].
