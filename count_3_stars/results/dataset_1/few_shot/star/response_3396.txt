Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 4) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 8

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are:

<1, (2, 5, 8)>
<2, (1, 9, 8)>
<3, (4, 7, 6)>
<4, (3, 7, 6)>
<5, (1, 8, 9)>
<7, (4, 9, 8)>
