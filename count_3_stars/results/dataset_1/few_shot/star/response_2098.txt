Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 4

Response:
Let's start by identifying the 3-star patterns in the given graph:

1. Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 4, and 5: <0, (2, 4, 5)>
2. Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 8, and 9: <3, (7, 8, 9)>
3. Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 8, and 9: <4, (0, 8, 9)>
4. Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 4, and 7: <8, (3, 4, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
