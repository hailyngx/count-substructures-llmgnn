Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the 3-star subgraphs. 

Let's identify the 3-star subgraphs by looking at each node as the potential central node and counting their respective leaves. 

Node 1: (1, (2, 5, 6))  
Node 2: (2, (0, 1, 5)), (2, (3, 7, 8))  
Node 3: (3, (2, 7, 8))  
Node 4: (4, (5, 7, 9))  
Node 5: (5, (1, 2, 4)), (5, (6, 1, 4))  
Node 6: (6, (1, 5, 7))  
Node 7: (7, (2, 3, 4)), (7, (6, 2, 4))  
Node 8: (8, (1, 2, 3))  
Node 9: (9, (3, 4))

Counting the unique 3-stars, we have:  
<1, (2, 5, 6)>, <2, (0, 1, 5)>, <2, (3, 7, 8)>, <3, (2, 7, 8)>, <4, (5, 7, 9)>, <5, (1, 2, 4)>, <5, (6, 1, 4)>, <6, (1, 5, 7)>, <7, (2, 3, 4)>, <7, (6, 2, 4)>, <8, (1, 2, 3)>, <9, (3, 4)> 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
