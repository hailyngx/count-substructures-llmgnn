Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star formation.
Here is the list of unique 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<8, (5, 6, 7)>

Count of 3-stars in the graph: [3]
