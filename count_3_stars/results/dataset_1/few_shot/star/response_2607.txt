Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 7

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 5, and 9 <0, (4, 5, 9)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 3, and 7 <1, (2, 3, 7)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 5, and 7 <3, (1, 5, 7)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 3, and 7 <5, (0, 3, 7)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 4, and 8 <6, (2, 4, 8)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, and 5 <7, (1, 3, 5)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 7, and 7 <9, (0, 7, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
