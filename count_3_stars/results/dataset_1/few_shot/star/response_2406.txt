Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 2

Response:
Given the graph information, let's first identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 0 forms a 3-star: <0, (1, 2, 5)>
2. Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (0, 2, 8)>
3. Node 2 forms a 3-star: <2, (0, 1, 4)>
4. Node 2 forms another 3-star: <2, (1, 7, 9)>
5. Node 4 forms a 3-star: <4, (2, 6, 0)>
6. Node 5 forms a 3-star: <5, (0, 7, 2)>
7. Node 7 forms a 3-star: <7, (2, 3, 5)>
8. Node 9 forms a 3-star: <9, (1, 2, 0)>

Therefore, there are [8] 3-stars in the graph.
