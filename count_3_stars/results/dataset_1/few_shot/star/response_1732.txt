Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Looking at the adjacency list, we see that nodes 0, 3, and 5 are the only nodes connected to exactly three other nodes each:

1. Node 0: connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, 6
2. Node 3: connected to nodes 0, 1, 5
3. Node 5: connected to nodes 2, 3, 4

Now we can count the number of distinct 3-stars in the given graph:

[3]

<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<3, (0, 1, 5)>
<5, (2, 3, 4)>
