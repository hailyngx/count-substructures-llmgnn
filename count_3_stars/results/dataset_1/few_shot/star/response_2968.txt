Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 6

Response:
Starting with the adjacency list, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0: <0, (5, 7)>
- Node 1: <1, (2, 3)>
- Node 2: <2, (1, 8)>
- Node 3: <3, (1, 6)>
- Node 8: <8, (2, 4)>
- Node 6: <6, (3, 9)>

Counting these unique 3-stars, we find a total of [6] 3-stars in the graph.
