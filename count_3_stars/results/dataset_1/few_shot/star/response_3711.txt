Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 8

Response:
The given graph has one 3-star with center node 0 and leaves 1, 4, and 5. 
So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1].

Unique 3-star found: <0, (1, 4, 5)>
