Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 7, and node 8

Response:
