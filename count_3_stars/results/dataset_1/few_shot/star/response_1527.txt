Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 5, and node 8

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are:
<0, (4, 5, 7)>
<0, (4, 5, 8)>
<0, (4, 7, 8)>
<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<5, (0, 6, 9)>
<6, (1, 7, 8)>
<8, (0, 6, 9)>
<9, (5, 8, 0)>
<9, (5, 8, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
