Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 7

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star configurations in the graph. 
We are looking for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

Upon examining the adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<1, (0, 5, 7)>
<1, (4, 5, 7)>
<1, (3, 7, 8)>
<2, (6, 7, 8)>
<3, (1, 7, 9)>
<4, (1, 5, 7)>
<5, (0, 1, 4)>
<6, (2, 7, 9)>
<7, (1, 2, 4)>
<8, (0, 1, 7)>
<9, (3, 6, 7)>

Counting the total number of unique 3-star configurations gives us the answer: [11].
