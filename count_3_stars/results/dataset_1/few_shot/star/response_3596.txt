Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 8) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 8

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are as follows:
- <0, (1, 6, 7)>
- <0, (1, 6, 8)>
- <0, (1, 7, 4)>
- <0, (1, 8, 3)>
- <0, (6, 1, 4)>
- <0, (6, 1, 7)>
- <0, (6, 1, 8)>
- <0, (7, 0, 4)>
- <0, (7, 4, 1)>
- <0, (8, 0, 3)>
- <0, (8, 0, 6)>
- <0, (8, 0, 7)>
- <1, (0, 6, 7)>
- <1, (4, 0, 7)>
- <1, (6, 0, 1)>
- <1, (6, 0, 8)>
- <1, (7, 0, 4)>
- <2, (8, 0, 3)>
- <3, (8, 0, 2)>
- <4, (1, 0, 7)>
- <4, (7, 0, 4)>
- <6, (0, 1, 7)>
- <6, (0, 1, 8)>
- <6, (1, 0, 4)>
- <6, (1, 0, 7)>
- <7, (0, 4, 1)>
- <7, (4, 0, 1)>
- <8, (0, 3, 8)>
- <8, (0, 6, 1)>
- <8, (0, 7, 4)>
- <8, (1, 0, 6)>
- <8, (1, 0, 7)>
- <8, (2, 0, 3)>
- <8, (3, 0, 8)>
- <8, (9, 0, 8)>
- <9, (8, 0, 8)>

Therefore, there are [34] 3-star graphs in the given graph.
