Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 7, and 8: <0, (1, 7, 8)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 5, and 7: <1, (0, 5, 7)>
- Node 7 forms two 3-stars:
  - <7, (0, 4, 6)>
  - <7, (0, 8, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
