Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 8

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- Node 0 forms 1 3-star: <0, (1, 5, 6)>
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star: <1, (0, 5, 6)>
- Node 5 forms 3 3-stars: <5, (0, 1, 7)>, <5, (3, 4, 7)>, <5, (0, 3, 4)>
- Node 6 forms 2 3-stars: <6, (0, 1, 7)>, <6, (3, 4, 8)>
- Node 7 forms 1 3-star: <7, (0, 3, 5)>
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star: <8, (4, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
