Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 0) (3, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 8

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph:

1. <0, (2, 3, 6)>
2. <0, (2, 3, 8)>
3. <0, (2, 6, 8)>
4. <0, (3, 6, 8)>
5. <4, (5, 9, 7)>
6. <4, (5, 9, 8)>
7. <4, (9, 7, 8)>
8. <7, (6, 9, 4)>
9. <8, (0, 9, 4)>
10. <8, (9, 7, 4)>
