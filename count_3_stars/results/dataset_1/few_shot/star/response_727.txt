Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we look for nodes that are connected to exactly 3 other nodes. These nodes will serve as the centers of the 3-stars. 

Upon examining the adjacency list for each node, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<1, (2, 4, 7)>
<2, (1, 3, 5)>
<3, (2, 5, 9)>
<4, (1, 5, 6)>
<5, (0, 2, 3)>
<6, (3, 4, 7)>
<7, (1, 2, 9)>

Count of 3-stars: [7]
