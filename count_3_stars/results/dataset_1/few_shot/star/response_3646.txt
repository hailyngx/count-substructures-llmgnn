Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 7

Response:
The number of 3-star subgraphs in the given graph: 

We can identify 3-star graphs by looking for nodes with exactly 3 neighbors and enumerate the 3-star configurations with those nodes as the centers.

Looking at the adjacency list for each node, we have the following nodes with 3 neighbors:
- Node 1 is a center for a 3-star: <1, (5, 6, 7)>
- Node 2 is a center for a 3-star: <2, (4, 7, 8)>
- Node 3 is a center for a 3-star: <3, (7, 8, 9)>
- Node 7 is a center for a 3-star: <7, (1, 2, 6)>, <7, (2, 3, 9)>

Thus, there are a total of [4] 3-star subgraphs in the given graph.
