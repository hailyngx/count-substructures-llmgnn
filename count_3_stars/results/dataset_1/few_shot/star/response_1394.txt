Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 7, and node 8

Response:
Step 1: Identify the number of 3-stars for each node.  
    - Node 0: 0 3-stars
    - Node 1: 4 3-stars (1, (0, 7, 5)), (1, (4, 6, 5)), (1, (7, 0, 5)), (1, (5, 4, 6))
    - Node 2: 0 3-stars
    - Node 3: 0 3-stars
    - Node 4: 4 3-stars (4, (1, 2, 6)), (4, (2, 5, 1)), (4, (5, 6, 1)), (4, (6, 1, 8))
    - Node 5: 2 3-stars (5, (1, 4, 7)), (5, (4, 6, 1))
    - Node 6: 2 3-stars (6, (1, 4, 8)), (6, (4, 1, 5))
    - Node 7: 2 3-stars (7, (0, 1, 9)), (7, (1, 5, 9))
    - Node 8: 2 3-stars (8, (3, 4, 9)), (8, (4, 6, 9))
    - Node 9: 0 3-stars

Step 2: Add up the total number of 3-stars in the graph.  
    - Total = 4 + 4 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 14

[14]

Unique 3-stars: 
    <1, (0, 7, 5)>, 
    <1, (4, 6, 5)>, 
    <1, (7, 0, 5)>, 
    <1, (5, 4, 6)>, 
    <4, (1, 2, 6)>, 
    <4, (2, 5, 1)>, 
    <4, (5, 6, 1)>, 
    <4, (6, 1, 8)>, 
    <5, (1, 4, 7)>, 
    <5, (4, 6, 1)>, 
    <6, (1, 4, 8)>, 
    <6, (4, 1, 5)>, 
    <7, (0, 1, 9)>, 
    <7, (1, 5, 9)>, 
    <8, (3, 4, 9)>, 
    <8, (4, 6, 9)>
