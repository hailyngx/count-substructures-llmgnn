Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 8) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 8
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, and node 6

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 5, 8
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 7, 8
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 9, (6 not included)
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 9, (5 not included)
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 2, 7

So, the unique 3-stars in the graph are: 
<0, (2, 5, 8)>
<2, (0, 7, 8)>
<5, (0, 9)>
<6, (1, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
