Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 2) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 2
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 8

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are as follows:
[<0, (3, 5, 0)>]
[<2, (6, 8, 2)>]
[<8, (2, 9, 8)>]
[]
(There are a total of 3 3-stars in this graph, so the answer is [3].)
