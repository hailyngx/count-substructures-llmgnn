Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 8

Response:
Starting from Node 0:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 4, and 8. <0, (3, 4, 8)>
From Node 1:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 7, and 9. <1, (3, 7, 9)>
From Node 3:
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, and 8. <3, (0, 1, 8)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 7, and 8. <3, (1, 7, 8)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 7, and 8. <3, (0, 7, 8)>
From Node 4:
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 9, and 5. <4, (0, 9, 5)>
From Node 5:
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 9, and 7. <5, (6, 9, 7)>
From Node 8:
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 3, and 9. <8, (0, 3, 9)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 9, and 5. <8, (3, 9, 5)>
From Node 9:
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 4, and 5. <9, (1, 4, 5)>

Count of 3-stars: [8]
