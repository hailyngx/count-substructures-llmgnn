Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 8

Response:
Given the graph, we can see that the central node of a 3-star graph must have exactly 3 neighbors. Let's identify the 3-stars within the given graph.

From the adjacency list, we can determine the following 3-stars:
1. <0, (1, 3, 4)>
2. <0, (1, 4, 8)>
3. <1, (0, 4, 5)>
4. <4, (0, 1, 9)>
5. <4, (9, 8, 1)>
6. <6, (8, 5, 8)>
7. <9, (4, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
