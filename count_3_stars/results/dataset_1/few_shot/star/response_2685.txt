Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 4

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- From node 0: <0, (1, 5, 6)>
- From node 1: <1, (0, 2, 5)>
- From node 5: <5, (0, 1, 2)>, <5, (7, 8, 1)>
- From node 6: <6, (0, 4, 8)>
- From node 7: <7, (1, 5, 8)>
- From node 8: <8, (5, 6, 7)>
- From node 9: <9, (3, 4, 0)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars: [7]
