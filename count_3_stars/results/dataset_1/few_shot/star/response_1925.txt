Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8

Response:
Let's determine the number of 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0 has 6 neighbors: 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. Possible 3-stars with node 0 as the center are:
1. <0, (2, 4, 5)>
2. <0, (2, 6, 7)>
3. <0, (4, 5, 7)>
4. <0, (6, 7, 8)>

Similarly, we can find the 3-stars centered at other nodes:

Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 3, 6, 9. Possible 3-stars with node 1 as the center are:
5. <1, (3, 6, 9)>

Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 0, 3, 5, 7. Possible 3-stars with node 2 as the center are:
6. <2, (0, 3, 5)>
7. <2, (0, 5, 7)>
8. <2, (3, 5, 7)>

Node 3 has 5 neighbors: 1, 2, 4, 6, 9. Possible 3-stars with node 3 as the center are:
9. <3, (1, 2, 4)>
10. <3, (1, 2, 6)>
11. <3, (1, 4, 6)>
12. <3, (2, 4, 6)>
13. <3, (2, 6, 9)>

By considering the connections, we can see that there are no more unique 3-stars in the graph. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [13].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<0, (2, 6, 7)>
<0, (4, 5, 7)>
<0, (6, 7, 8)>
<1, (3, 6, 9)>
<2, (0, 3, 5)>
<2, (0, 5, 7)>
<2, (3, 5, 7)>
<3, (1, 2, 4)>
<3, (1, 2, 6)>
<3, (1, 4, 6)>
<3, (2, 4, 6)>
<3, (2, 6, 9)>
