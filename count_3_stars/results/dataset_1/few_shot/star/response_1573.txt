Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 5
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to understand that a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. In this case, the central node has degree 3.

Let's find the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 1 is not a central node of any 3-star because it is connected to only 2 nodes.
- Node 2 is not a central node of any 3-star because it is connected to 3 nodes.
- Node 3 is a central node with neighbors 4, 5, and 7.  
- Node 4 is a central node with neighbors 1, 3, and 8.  
- Node 5 is not a central node of any 3-star because it is connected to only 2 nodes.
- Node 6 is not a central node of any 3-star because it is connected to only 1 node.
- Node 7 is not a central node of any 3-star because it is connected to 3 nodes.
- Node 8 is not a central node of any 3-star because it is connected to 3 nodes.
  
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is: [2]
The unique 3-stars found are: <3, (4, 5, 7)> <4, (1, 3, 8)>
