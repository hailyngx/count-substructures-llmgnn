Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 8

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph. 

There are 10 nodes in total.
We can see that each node has connections to other nodes, forming various 3-stars.

Now, let's go through each node to find the 3-stars with that node as the central node:

1. Node 0:
<0, (4, 6, 7)>
<0, (4, 7, 8)>

2. Node 1:
No 3-stars with node 1 as the center.

3. Node 2:
<2, (7, 8, 9)>

4. Node 3:
No 3-stars with node 3 as the center.

5. Node 4:
<4, (0, 7, 2)>

6. Node 5:
No 3-stars with node 5 as the center.

7. Node 6:
<6, (0, 7, 8)>
<6, (0, 5, 7)>

8. Node 7:
No new 3-star found with node 7 as the center.

9. Node 8:
<8, (0, 2, 6)>
<8, (0, 2, 9)>

10. Node 9:
No new 3-star found with node 9 as the center.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (4, 6, 7)>, 
<0, (4, 7, 8)>, 
<2, (7, 8, 9)>, 
<4, (0, 7, 2)>, 
<6, (0, 7, 8)>, 
<6, (0, 5, 7)>, 
<8, (0, 2, 6)>, 
<8, (0, 2, 9)>.
