Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all sets of nodes where one node is connected to exactly three other nodes while those three nodes are not directly connected to each other. Let's go through the process step-by-step:

1. Identify nodes with exactly three neighbors:
   - From the adjacency list, we can see that nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, and 7 have exactly three neighbors.

2. Find 3-stars centered at these nodes:
   - For each of the identified nodes, check if the neighbors form a 3-star pattern.

   - For node 0:
     - <0, (2, 3, 4)>
     - <0, (3, 5, 7)>
     - <0, (4, 6, 8)>
     Total: 3 3-stars centered at node 0.

   - For node 1:
     - No 3-star centered at node 1 as its neighbors are directly connected.

   - For node 3:
     - <3, (1, 6, 7)>
     Total: 1 3-star centered at node 3.

   - For node 4:
     - No 3-star centered at node 4 as its neighbors are directly connected.

   - For node 7:
     - <7, (5, 0, 8)>
     Total: 1 3-star centered at node 7.

3. Calculate the total number of unique 3-stars:
   - Total unique 3-stars: <0, (2, 3, 4)>, <0, (3, 5, 7)>, <0, (4, 6, 8)>, <3, (1, 6, 7)>, <7, (5, 0, 8)>
   
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
