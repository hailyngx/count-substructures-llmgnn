Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (4, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 6

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern.

Let's list the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (7, 8, 9)>
<1, (3, 7, 9)>
<2, (8)>
<3, (1)>
<4, (6, 9)>
<5, (9)>
<6, (4, 9)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we get a total of [7].
