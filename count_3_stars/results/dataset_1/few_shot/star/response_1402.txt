Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 8

Response:
Based on the given information, the 3-stars in the graph are as follows:

<0, (2, 5, 7)>
<0, (2, 9, 5)>
<0, (5, 1, 7)>
<0, (5, 1, 9)>
<1, (3, 4, 6)>
<1, (3, 8, 5)>
<2, (0, 9, 5)>
<3, (1, 8, 5)>
<3, (1, 4, 6)>
<5, (0, 1, 9)>
<5, (1, 8, 9)>
<8, (3, 1, 9)>

Count of 3-stars: [12]
