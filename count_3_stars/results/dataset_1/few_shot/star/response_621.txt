Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Based on the provided adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (2, 8, 9)>
<1, (2, 3, 5)>
<3, (1, 4, 5)>
<5, (1, 3, 9)>
<7, (1, 4, 6)>
<9, (5, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
