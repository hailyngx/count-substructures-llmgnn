Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we look for each node and identify 3-stars centered at that node.

Based on the given adjacency list and the definition of a 3-star graph:
- Node 0 has a 3-star: <0, (2, 5, 7)>
- Node 1 has a 3-star: <1, (4, 5, 7)>
- Node 2 has a 3-star: <2, (0, 5, 7)>
- Node 5 has two 3-stars: <5, (0, 1, 7)> and <5, (2, 1, 7)>
- Node 7 has a 3-star: <7, (0, 1, 5)>
- Node 8 has no 3-stars
- Node 6 has no 3-stars
- Node 9 has no 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].  
The unique 3-stars are: <0, (2, 5, 7)>, <1, (4, 5, 7)>, <2, (0, 5, 7)>, <5, (0, 1, 7)>, <5, (2, 1, 7)>, <7, (0, 1, 5)>.
