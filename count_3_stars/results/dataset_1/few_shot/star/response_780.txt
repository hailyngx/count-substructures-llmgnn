Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 5) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 5
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 7

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star shape.

From the given adjacency list and edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<1, (2, 8, 9)>
<5, (3, 6, 9)>
<6, (5, 7, 8)>
<9, (1, 5, 7)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
