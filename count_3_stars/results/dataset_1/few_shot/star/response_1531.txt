Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the 3-stars based on the definition provided.

Based on the information given:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star: <0, (3, 8, 9)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (2, 4, 5)>
- Node 2 does not form a 3-star since it is not connected to exactly three other nodes.
- Node 3 forms a 3-star: <3, (0, 1, 4)>
- Node 4 does not form a 3-star since it is not connected to exactly three other nodes.
- Node 5 does not form a 3-star since it is not connected to exactly three other nodes.
- Node 6 forms a 3-star: <6, (1, 7, 8)>
- Node 7 does not form a 3-star since it is not connected to exactly three other nodes.
- Node 8 does not form a 3-star since it is not connected to exactly three other nodes.
- Node 9 does not form a 3-star since it is not connected to exactly three other nodes.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
