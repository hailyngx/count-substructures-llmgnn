Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, and node 8

Response:
We can start by identifying the 3-star graphs in the given graph. 

Let's list the 3-star graphs below:
<2, (1, 4, 9)>
<2, (3, 6, 8)>
<6, (3, 5, 7)>

Now, count the total number of 3-stars: [3].
