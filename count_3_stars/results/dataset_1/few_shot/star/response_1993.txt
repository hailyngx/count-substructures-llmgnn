Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step by step:

1. Identify nodes connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 0: Connected to nodes 3, 4, 5. Forms a 3-star: <0, (3, 4, 5)>
- Node 2: Connected to nodes 3, 7, 8. Forms a 3-star: <2, (3, 7, 8)>
- Node 5: Connected to nodes 0, 6, 7. Forms a 3-star: <5, (0, 6, 7)>

Count of 3-stars in the graph: [3]

Therefore, the final answer is [3].
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (3, 4, 5)>
- <2, (3, 7, 8)>
- <5, (0, 6, 7)>
