Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 4) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will find all occurrences of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify them step by step:

1. Nodes connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 7.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 6.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 7, and 4.

2. 3-stars:
<3, (4, 6, 7)>  [1]
<8, (3, 4, 6)> [2]
<8, (3, 4, 8)> [3]
<8, (4, 6, 3)> [4]
<8, (4, 6, 8)> [5]
<9, (0, 4, 7)> [6]
<9, (4, 0, 7)> [7]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
