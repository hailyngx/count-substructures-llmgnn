Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 5

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 4)> 
<1, (0, 4)>
<2, (5, 9)>
<3, (5, 7)>
<5, (2, 3, 9)>
<7, (3, 5, 8)>
<8, (5, 7)>
<9, (2, 5)>
