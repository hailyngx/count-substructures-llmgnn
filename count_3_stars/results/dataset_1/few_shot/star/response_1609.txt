Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, and node 7

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph by checking for each node the number of 3-stars it is part of. 

Node 0: (0, 5, 7, 8) - No 3-star since it is connected to 4 nodes.

Node 1: (1, 2, 3, 7, 8) - <1, (2, 3, 7)>

Node 2: (1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9) - <2, (1, 3, 4)>

Node 3: (1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7) - <3, (1, 2, 5)>

Node 4: (2, 5, 8) - No 3-star since it is connected to only 3 nodes.

Node 5: (0, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9) - No 3-star since it is connected to 6 nodes.

Node 6: (3, 5, 9) - No 3-star since it is connected to only 3 nodes.

Node 7: (0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 9) - <7, (0, 1, 5)>

Node 8: (0, 1, 4) - No 3-star since it is connected to only 3 nodes.

Node 9: (2, 5, 6, 7) - <9, (2, 5, 7)>

There are a total of [3] unique 3-stars in this graph.
