Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all occurrences where a node connects to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern. 

From the given adjacency list, we can identify the nodes that form 3-stars. Here are the 3-stars found in the graph:

<1, (3, 5, 9)>
<1, (6, 7, 8)>
<1, (5, 7, 9)>
<2, (3, 8, 9)>
<3, (1, 2, 9)>
<7, (1, 4, 9)>
<9, (1, 3, 5)>

Count of 3-stars: [7]
