Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 9
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 7

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be found by counting the number of 3-stars centered at each node. Let's break it down:

- Node 0: <0, (2, 3, 4)>.
- Node 1: <1, (5, 7, 9)>.
- Node 3: <3, (0, 4, 7)>.
- Node 4: <4, (3, 5, 7)>.
- Node 5: <5, (1, 4, 9)>.
- Node 7: <7, (1, 3, 9)>.
- Node 9: <9, (1, 5, 7)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
