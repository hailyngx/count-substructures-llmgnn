Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Examining the given graph:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3 and 7.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 8.
- Node 2 is connected to node 3.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 4.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 5, and 7.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 6, 7, and 8.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 5, 7, and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 5, 6, and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1 and 5.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 6 and 7.

From the given edges, we can identify the 3-stars as follows:
- <0, (3, 7, 4)>
- <1, (4, 5, 8)>
- <3, (0, 2, 4)>
- <4, (1, 3, 5)>
- <5, (1, 4, 6)>
- <5, (1, 4, 7)>
- <5, (1, 7, 8)>
- <7, (0, 4, 5)>
- <7, (0, 5, 9)>
- <7, (4, 5, 6)>
- <7, (5, 6, 9)>

Counting the number of 3-stars found, we have a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
