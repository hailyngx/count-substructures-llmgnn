Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 7

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star and count them. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's go through the graph and identify the 3-stars:
1. Node 1 with leaves 3, 5, 7 <1, (3, 5, 7)>
2. Node 2 with leaves 0, 3, 5 <2, (0, 3, 5)>
3. Node 4 with leaves 0, 6, 7 <4, (0, 6, 7)>
4. Node 5 with leaves 1, 2, 6 <5, (1, 2, 6)>
5. Node 7 with leaves 1, 4, 5 <7, (1, 4, 5)>

So, there are 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
