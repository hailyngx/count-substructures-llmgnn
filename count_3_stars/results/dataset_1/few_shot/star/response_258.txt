Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's find all the 3-stars in the graph based on the given information. 

Here are the 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (1, 2, 8)>
<1, (0, 2, 4)>
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<4, (0, 1, 7)>
<7, (0, 4, 6)>

Therefore, there are a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
