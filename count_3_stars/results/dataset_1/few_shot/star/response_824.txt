Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 2

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star where one node is the center connected to exactly three leaves.

First, let's list out the 3-stars present in the graph:
<0, (3, 4, 7)>
<0, (3, 4, 9)>
<0, (3, 7, 9)>
<3, (0, 4, 5)>
<3, (0, 4, 6)>
<3, (0, 5, 8)>
<4, (0, 2, 5)>
<4, (0, 2, 6)>
<4, (0, 5, 6)>
<5, (3, 4, 6)>
<5, (3, 4, 8)>
<6, (2, 3, 5)>
<6, (2, 3, 8)>

The number of 3-stars in the given graph is: [13]
