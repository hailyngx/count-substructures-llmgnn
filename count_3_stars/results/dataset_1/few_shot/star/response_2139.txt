Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern. 

Let's identify the unique 3-stars:

<1, (4, 6, 9)>
<4, (1, 6, 9)>
<6, (1, 4, 9)>
<9, (1, 4, 6)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars: [4].
