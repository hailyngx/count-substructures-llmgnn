Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 3

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to first identify all possible 3-stars based on the definition provided. 

In a 3-star, there is a central node connected to exactly 3 other nodes. Let's examine each node:

1. Node 1: (1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)
2. Node 2: (2, 5, 7)
3. Node 3: (3, 9)
4. Node 4: (4, 6, 7)
5. Node 5: (1, 2, 5, 6)
6. Node 6: (1, 4, 5, 6, 7)
7. Node 7: (1, 2, 4, 6, 7)
8. Node 8: (1)
9. Node 9: (1, 3)

Now, we will look for 3-stars by checking the connections of each possible center node. A 3-star is uniquely defined by its center and three connected nodes.

Let's list the unique 3-stars we find:

<1, (5, 6, 7)>
<1, (5, 6, 9)>
<1, (5, 7, 9)>
<1, (6, 7, 9)>
<5, (1, 2, 6)>
<5, (1, 6, 7)>
<6, (1, 4, 7)>
<6, (1, 5, 7)>
<6, (4, 5, 7)>
<7, (1, 2, 4)>

Now let's count the total number of 3-stars found: [10].
