Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star pattern, which consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through the adjacency list for each node to find the 3-stars.

1. Node 0: No 3-stars can be formed with node 0 as the center since it has only 2 connected nodes.

2. Node 1: <1, (0, 2, 3)>, <1, (0, 4, 7)>, <1, (2, 3, 4)>, <1, (2, 4, 8)>, <1, (3, 4, 8)> (5 3-stars)

3. Node 2: No 3-stars can be formed with node 2 as the center since it has only 3 connected nodes but they're not mutually connected.

4. Node 3: No 3-stars can be formed with node 3 as the center since it has only 3 connected nodes but they're not mutually connected.

5. Node 4: <4, (1, 8, 9)> (1 3-star)

6. Node 5: No 3-stars can be formed with node 5 as the center since it has only 2 connected nodes.

7. Node 6: No 3-stars can be formed with node 6 as the center since it has only 1 connected node.

8. Node 7: No 3-stars can be formed with node 7 as the center since it has only 2 connected nodes.

9. Node 8: No 3-stars can be formed with node 8 as the center since it has 4 connected nodes but they're not mutually connected.

10. Node 9: No 3-stars can be formed with node 9 as the center since it has only 1 connected node.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: <1, (0, 2, 3)>, <1, (0, 4, 7)>, <1, (2, 3, 4)>, <1, (2, 4, 8)>, <1, (3, 4, 8)>, <4, (1, 8, 9)>.
