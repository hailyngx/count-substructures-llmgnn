Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes. These instances represent 3-stars in the graph.

Based on the given adjacency list and the definition of a 3-star graph, we can find the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (2, 7, 1)>
<1, (7, 9, 0)>
<2, (0, 3, 7)>
<3, (2, 8, 0)>
<4, (8, 9, 7)>
<5, (7, 8, 6)>
<6, (5, 7, 8)>
<7, (0, 1, 5)>
<8, (3, 4, 5)>
<9, (1, 4, 7)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9]. 
The unique 3-stars found are <0, (2, 7, 1)>, <1, (7, 9, 0)>, <2, (0, 3, 7)>, <3, (2, 8, 0)>, <4, (8, 9, 7)>, <5, (7, 8, 6)>, <6, (5, 7, 8)>, <7, (0, 1, 5)>, <8, (3, 4, 5)>, <9, (1, 4, 7)>
