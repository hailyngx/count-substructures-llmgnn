Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, and node 8

Response:
Since a 3-star graph consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can find them by looking for nodes with exactly three neighbors. 

Let's list the 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (3, 4, 6)>
<0, (3, 6, 7)>
<3, (0, 6, 9)>
<6, (0, 3, 7)>
<9, (2, 6, 8)>
