Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node forms a 3-star with exactly three other nodes connected to it. Since a 3-star graph has a center node connected to exactly three leaves, we need to look for nodes with 3 edges emanating from them that do not have an edge between any other pair of leaves connected to the center.

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node **1**: (1, 2), (1, 7) - [1, (2, 7)]
2. Node **3**: (3, 5), (3, 8) - [3, (5, 8)]
3. Node **4**: (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 8) - [4, (5, 6, 8)]
4. Node **6**: (6, 4), (6, 7), (6, 9) - [6, (4, 7, 9)]
5. Node **7**: (7, 1), (7, 6), (7, 9) - [7, (1, 6, 9)]
6. Node **8**: (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 5) - [8, (3, 4, 5)]
7. Node **9**: (9, 6), (9, 7), (9, 8) - [9, (6, 7, 8)]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is **7**.
