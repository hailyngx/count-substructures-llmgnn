Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first define a 3-star as a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's analyze the graph based on this definition:

1. Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 3, 4, and 8. It forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 4, and 8. <0, (3, 4, 8)>
   
2. Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 3, 5, and 6. It forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 5, and 6. <2, (3, 5, 6)>
  
3. Node 3 has 5 neighbors: 0, 2, 4, 6, and 9. It forms two 3-stars: <3, (0, 4, 6)> and <3, (2, 4, 6)>.

4. Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 0, 3, 5, 6, and 7. It forms two 3-stars: <4, (0, 5, 7)> and <4, (3, 5, 6)>.

5. Node 6 has 5 neighbors: 2, 3, 4, 8, and 9. It forms two 3-stars: <6, (2, 4, 8)> and <6, (3, 4, 9)>.

6. Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 6, and 7. It forms one 3-star: <8, (0, 1, 7)>.

7. Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 3, 5, and 6. It forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 5, and 6. <9, (3, 5, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 4, 8)>, <2, (3, 5, 6)>, <3, (0, 4, 6)>, <3, (2, 4, 6)>, <4, (0, 5, 7)>, <4, (3, 5, 6)>, <6, (2, 4, 8)>, <6, (3, 4, 9)>, <8, (0, 1, 7)>, <9, (3, 5, 6)>
