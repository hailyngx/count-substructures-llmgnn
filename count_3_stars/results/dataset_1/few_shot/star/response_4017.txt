Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node has exactly three neighbors, forming a 3-star configuration.

Looking at the adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (3, 5, 7)>
<4, (6, 8, 9)>

There are a total of 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the count of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
