Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 3

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, first, we need to identify the 3-stars present in the graph. 

A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three leaf nodes. 

Based on the given information, the 3-stars in the graph are as follows:
<0, (2, 3, 6)>
<2, (0, 5, 6)>
<3, (0, 4, 5)>
<5, (1, 2, 6)>
<6, (0, 1, 2)>
<7, (2, 6, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
