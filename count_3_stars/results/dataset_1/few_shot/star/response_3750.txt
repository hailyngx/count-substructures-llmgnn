Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 8) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will look for each possible combination of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Based on the provided information, the 3-stars in the given graph are as follows:
<0, (2, 7, 9)>
<1, (2, 4, 8)>
<2, (0, 1, 4)>
<4, (1, 2, 8)>
<7, (0, 2, 9)>
<8, (1, 5, 6)>

Count of 3-stars in the graph: [6]
