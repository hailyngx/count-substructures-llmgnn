Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 0) (4, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, which are defined as a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars present in the graph.

Let's list all the unique 3-stars:  
<0, (1, 3, 4)>  
<0, (1, 6, 7)>   
<1, (0, 7, 9)>  
<6, (0, 2, 9)>  
<7, (0, 1, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
