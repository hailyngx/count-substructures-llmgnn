Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 7
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 6

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern where a node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes. 

Looking at the adjacency list provided, the nodes that are connected to exactly 3 other nodes are as follows:

- Node 0 (connected to nodes 2, 4, 5)
- Node 4 (connected to nodes 0, 1, 9)
- Node 5 (connected to nodes 0, 7, 8)
- Node 6 (connected to nodes 8, 9)

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars: 

<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<4, (0, 1, 9)>
<5, (0, 7, 8)>
<6, (8, 9)>

There are [4] unique 3-stars found in the given graph.
