Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 0

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (2, 9)>
2. <1, (5, 7)>
3. <2, (0, 3, 5)>
4. <2, (0, 5, 8)>
5. <2, (3, 6, 8)>
6. <3, (2, 6, 8)>
7. <4, (7)>
8. <5, (1, 2, 7)>
9. <6, (2, 3, 7)>
10. <7, (1, 4, 5)>
11. <8, (2)>
12. <9, (0)>

Therefore, there are 12 3-stars in the given graph. 
So, the final answer is [12].
