Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

First, let's list all the 3-stars: 

<0, (4, 7, 8)>
<2, (5, 7, 9)>
<4, (0, 7, 8)>
<5, (2, 6, 9)>
<7, (0, 1, 4)>
<8, (2, 3, 6)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars.
