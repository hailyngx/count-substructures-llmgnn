Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 1

Response:
The 3-stars in this graph are:

<1, (2, 8, 9)>
<2, (1, 5, 6)>
<5, (0, 2, 3)>
<8, (1, 3, 4)>
<1, (2, 8, 9)>
<2, (1, 5, 6)>
<5, (0, 2, 3)>
<8, (1, 3, 4)>

There are a total of [4] 3-stars in the given graph.
