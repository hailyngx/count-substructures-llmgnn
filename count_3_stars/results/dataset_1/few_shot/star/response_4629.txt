Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 6
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:

[<0, (2, 4, 6)>, <2, (0, 6, 7)>, <2, (0, 6, 8)>, <2, (5, 6, 7)>, <2, (5, 6, 8)>, <2, (6, 7, 8)>, <4, (0, 2, 8)>, <6, (0, 2, 7)>, <6, (2, 7, 8)>, <7, (2, 6, 8)>]
