Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star structures in the given graph by looking for nodes that have exactly three neighbors and forming 3-stars with them. 

From the information provided, the nodes with exactly three neighbors are:
- Node 0 (connected to 1 neighbor, node 6)
- Node 8 (connected to 2 neighbors, nodes 3 and 5)
- Node 9 (connected to 3 neighbors, nodes 1, 2, and 5).

This gives us the following 3-star structures:
<0, (1, 6)>
<8, (3, 5)>
<9, (1, 2, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
