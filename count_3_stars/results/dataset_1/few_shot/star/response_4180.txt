Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all 3-stars by finding central nodes connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's go through each node and its neighbors to identify the 3-stars:

- Node 0: No 3-stars as it is connected to 2 nodes only.
- Node 1: No 3-stars as it is connected to 1 node only.
- Node 2: No 3-stars as it is connected to 2 nodes only.
- Node 3: One 3-star: <3, (5, 6, 8)>
- Node 4: No 3-stars as it is connected to 3 nodes but not in a 3-star pattern.
- Node 5: Two 3-stars: <5, (0, 3, 8)>, <5, (1, 3, 4)>
- Node 6: No 3-stars as it is connected to 2 nodes only.
- Node 7: No 3-stars as it is connected to 1 node only.
- Node 8: No 3-stars as it is connected to 3 nodes but not in a 3-star pattern.
- Node 9: No 3-stars as it is connected to 2 nodes only.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is 3.
