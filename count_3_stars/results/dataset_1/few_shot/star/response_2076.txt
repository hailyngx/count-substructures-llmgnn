Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 7

Response:
Given the graph information, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Possible 3-stars with node 0 as the center:
   - <0, (4, 5, 7)>

2. Possible 3-stars with node 1 as the center:
   - <1, (2, 7, 8)>

3. Possible 3-stars with node 2 as the center:
   - <2, (1, 4, 8)>
   - <2, (6, 4, 7)>
   - <2, (9, 8, 1)>

4. Possible 3-stars with node 3 as the center: (None)

5. Possible 3-stars with node 4 as the center:
   - <4, (0, 2, 6)>

6. Possible 3-stars with node 5 as the center: (None)

7. Possible 3-stars with node 6 as the center: (None)

8. Possible 3-stars with node 7 as the center:
   - <7, (0, 1, 9)>

9. Possible 3-stars with node 8 as the center: (None)

10. Possible 3-stars with node 9 as the center: (None)

Count of 3-stars in the given graph: [6]
