Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 5, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars where a node is the central node with exactly three other nodes connected to it. 

Based on the given adjacency list, we can determine the following 3-stars:
<0, (1, 4, 7)>
<0, (1, 4, 9)>
<0, (1, 7, 9)>
<4, (0, 2, 7)>
<4, (0, 3, 7)>
<4, (0, 6, 7)>
<7, (0, 5, 9)>
<8, (2, 5, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7]. 
These unique 3-stars are <0, (1, 4, 7)>, <0, (1, 4, 9)>, <0, (1, 7, 9)>, <4, (0, 2, 7)>, <4, (0, 3, 7)>, <4, (0, 6, 7)>, and <7, (0, 5, 9)>.
