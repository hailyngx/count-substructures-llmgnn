Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars: 
<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<1, (0, 4, 6)>
<4, (1, 5, 6)>
<6, (1, 4, 7)>
<7, (1, 6, 2)>
<9, (1, 3, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
