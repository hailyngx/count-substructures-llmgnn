Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 3) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 3
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we look for each node that has exactly three neighbors and form a 3-star centered at that node.

From the given information, the nodes with exactly three neighbors are 0, 8, and 9. Let's construct the 3-stars centered at each of these nodes:

1. For node 0: <0, (2, 5, 8)>
2. For node 8: <8, (0, 9, 9)>
3. For node 9: <9, (4, 8, 8)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
