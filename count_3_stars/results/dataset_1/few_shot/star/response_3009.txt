Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's determine the 3-stars:

1. Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 9.
   - <2, (1, 3, 9)>

2. Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 7.
   - <3, (2, 5, 7)>
   - There are no other nodes that form a 3-star with node 3.

3. Node 5 is connected to nodes 3, 6, and 9.
   - <5, (3, 6, 9)>

Therefore, there are a total of [3] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
