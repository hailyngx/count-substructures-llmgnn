Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Looking at the adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (1, 6, 7)> 
<0, (1, 7, 8)> 
<0, (1, 7, 9)> 
<0, (6, 7, 8)> 
<0, (6, 7, 9)> 
<0, (7, 8, 9)> 
<3, (4, 5, 8)> 
<3, (4, 8, 9)> 
<3, (5, 7, 9)> 
<3, (8, 9, 0)> 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
