Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the unique configurations where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list the 3-stars in the graph:

<1, (2, 5, 7)>
<2, (1, 3, 7)>
<7, (1, 2, 5)>
<8, (1, 2, 9)>

Count of 3-stars: [4]
