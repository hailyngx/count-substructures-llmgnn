Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- There are no 3-star patterns in this graph.

Therefore, the final answer is: [0]
