Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, 6, 7, and node 8

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 

Let's start with the center node 0. Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 7, 8, and 9. 

1. <0, (2, 7, 8)>
2. <0, (2, 7, 9)>
3. <0, (2, 8, 9)>
4. <0, (7, 8, 9)>

Moving on to the center node 2. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 9.

5. <2, (0, 4, 9)>

Now, let's check center node 7. Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 6, 8, and 9.

6. <7, (0, 6, 8)>
7. <7, (0, 6, 9)>
8. <7, (0, 8, 9)>
9. <7, (6, 8, 9)>

Lastly, let's examine center node 8. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 5, 7, and 9.

10. <8, (0, 5, 7)>
11. <8, (0, 5, 9)>
12. <8, (0, 7, 9)>
13. <8, (5, 7, 9)>

Counting the total number of unique 3-stars found in the graph: [13].
