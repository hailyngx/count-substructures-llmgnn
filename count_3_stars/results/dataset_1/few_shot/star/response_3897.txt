Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 6

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are as follows:
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<0, (2, 8, 9)>
<4, (0, 1, 2)>
<4, (0, 5, 7)>
