Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 5

Response:
The given graph contains the following 3-stars:

<1, (2, 4, 5)>
<2, (1, 3, 5)>
<3, (2, 4, 7)>
<5, (1, 2, 9)>
<7, (3, 5, 8)>
<9, (2, 3, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
