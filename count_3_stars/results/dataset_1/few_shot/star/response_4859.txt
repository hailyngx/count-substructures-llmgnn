Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the sets of nodes that form 3-star structures. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we can see that the nodes connected to each node. We can then check for each node if there are exactly 3 edges connected to it, forming a 3-star.

After examining the graph, we find the following 3-stars:
<0, (4, 8)>
<1, (2, 5, 6)>
<2, (1, 3, 6)>
<3, (2, 4, 5)>
<4, (0, 3, 5)>
<5, (1, 3, 4)>
<6, (1, 2, 3)>
<7, (3, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 5, 7)>
<9, (1, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
