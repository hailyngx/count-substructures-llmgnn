Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, 6, and node 7

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Identify the 3-stars by looking for nodes with exactly 3 neighbors. 

From the adjacency list:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors => Not a 3-star.
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors => Not a 3-star.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors (3, 7, 8) => Possible 3-star.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors => Not a 3-star.
- Node 4 has 1 neighbor => Not a 3-star.
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors => Not a 3-star.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors (1, 3, 9) => Possible 3-star.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors => Not a 3-star.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors (2, 5, 7) => Possible 3-star.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors => Not a 3-star.

2. Check which of the possible 3-stars are actually 3-stars by verifying if they have the necessary connections. 

- Node 2: (2, 7, 8) => <2, (7, 8)>
- Node 6: (1, 3, 9) => <6, (1, 3, 9)>
- Node 8: (2, 5, 7) => <8, (2, 5, 7)>

3. Count the number of unique 3-stars found.

There are [3] 3-stars in the given graph.
The unique 3-stars are: <<2, (7, 8)>, <6, (1, 3, 9)>, <8, (2, 5, 7)>]
