Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 8

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that is the center of a 3-star. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to three other nodes.

Based on the given adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<2, (4, 6, 8)>
<3, (4, 5, 8)>
<4, (2, 5, 9)>
<8, (2, 3, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4]. 
Here are the unique 3-stars found:
<2, (4, 6, 8)>
<3, (4, 5, 8)>
<4, (2, 5, 9)>
<8, (2, 3, 9)>
