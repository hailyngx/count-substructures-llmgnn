Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 8
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify every instance where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in the form of a star.

Looking at the graph and the adjacency list, we can find the following 3-stars:
<0, (2, 7, 9)>
<4, (1, 5, 7)>
<8, (2, 5, 6)>
<9, (0, 4, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
