Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 9) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all occurrences where a center node is connected to exactly three leaves. 

To simplify the process, we can start by listing all the possible 3-stars based on the given information. Once we identify all unique 3-stars, we can count them to get the total number of 3-stars in the graph.

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (1, 8, 8)>
<1, (0, 3, 8)>
<2, (6, 7, 7)>
<3, (1, 9, 9)>
<4, (7, 9, 9)>
<7, (2, 4, 8)>

Based on the identified unique 3-stars, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
