Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 8

Response:
To find the number of 3-star subgraphs in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star present. 

Looking at the adjacency list for each node and the definition of a 3-star graph, we can see that a 3-star is formed when a node (center) connects to exactly three other nodes (leaves).

For this graph:
- Node 0 forms 3-stars with (1, 5, 8) and (2, 5, 8)
- Node 1 forms 3-stars with (0, 5, 8) and (5, 6, 7)
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with (0, 5, 7)
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with (0, 8, 9)

Therefore, there are four unique 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<0, (2, 5, 8)>
<1, (0, 5, 8)>
<1, (5, 6, 7)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
