Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

We start by listing out all possible 3-stars and then eliminate duplicates to find the unique 3-stars.

Potential 3-stars:
1. (1, 2, 3)
2. (1, 2, 6)
3. (1, 3, 6)
4. (2, 3, 4)
5. (2, 3, 6)
6. (2, 3, 9)
7. (3, 4, 9)
8. (4, 7, 9)
9. (4, 8, 9)
10. (3, 5, 6)
11. (5, 6, 8)
12. (5, 6, 7)
13. (6, 8, 9)

Now, we look for unique 3-stars:
<1, (2, 3, 6)>
<2, (3, 4, 9)>
<3, (5, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
