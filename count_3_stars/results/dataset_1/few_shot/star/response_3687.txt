Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 5, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find the 3-stars centered at each node. A 3-star has a center connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph step by step:

1. Identify possible 3-stars centered at each node:
- Node 0: No 3-stars as it is only connected to 2 nodes.
- Node 1: <1, (0, 5, 6)>, <1, (2, 5, 8)>, <1, (5, 8, 9)>
- Node 2: No 3-stars as it is only connected to 2 nodes.
- Node 3: No 3-stars as it is only connected to 2 nodes.
- Node 4: No 3-stars as it is only connected to 2 nodes.
- Node 5: <5, (1, 2, 4)>, <5, (1, 4, 8)>, <5, (1, 8, 9)>
- Node 6: No 3-stars as it is only connected to 1 node.
- Node 7: No 3-stars as it is only connected to 1 node.
- Node 8: No 3-stars as it is only connected to 3 nodes.
- Node 9: <9, (1, 5, 7)>, <9, (1, 7, 8)>, <9, (5, 7, 8)>

2. Count the total number of unique 3-stars found:
- Total unique 3-stars: 6

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (0, 5, 6)>, <1, (2, 5, 8)>, <1, (5, 8, 9)>, <5, (1, 2, 4)>, <5, (1, 4, 8)>, <9, (1, 5, 7)>
