Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 4, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list them out.

<2, (3, 4, 9)>
<4, (2, 5, 6)>
<7, (2, 3, 9)>
<8, (5, 6, 9)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
