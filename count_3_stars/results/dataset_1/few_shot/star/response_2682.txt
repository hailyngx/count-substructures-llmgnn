Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 6
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars present in the graph.

Let's list out the unique 3-stars:

<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<3, (0, 4, 5)>
<4, (3, 5, 6)>
<8, (1, 3, 4)>

Now, we count the total number of 3-stars: [4].
