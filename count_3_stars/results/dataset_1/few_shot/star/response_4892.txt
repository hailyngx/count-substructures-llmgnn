Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star configuration. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

From the provided information, the nodes with their connections are as follows:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 4, 5, 8
- Node 1: None
- Node 2: 0, 3, 8
- Node 3: 0, 2, 5, 6
- Node 4: 0, 9
- Node 5: 0, 3, 6, 7, 9
- Node 6: 3, 5, 9
- Node 7: 5, 9
- Node 8: 0, 2, 9
- Node 9: 4, 5, 6, 7, 8

Now, let's find the 3-stars in the graph:

1. <0, (2, 3, 8)>
2. <0, (3, 5, 8)>
3. <0, (4, 5, 8)>
4. <0, (5, 6, 8)>
5. <0, (5, 7, 8)>
6. <2, (0, 3, 8)>
7. <3, (0, 5, 6)>
8. <4, (0, 5, 8)>
9. <5, (0, 3, 6)>
10. <5, (0, 6, 7)>
11. <5, (3, 6, 9)>
12. <5, (6, 7, 9)>
13. <6, (3, 5, 9)>
14. <7, (5, 6, 9)>
15. <8, (0, 2, 9)>
16. <9, (4, 5, 8)>
17. <9, (5, 6, 7)>
18. <9, (6, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [18].
