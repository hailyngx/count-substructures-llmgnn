Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 7

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 

The 3-stars are as follows:
<0, (2, 6, 7)>
<0, (2, 6, 9)>
<1, (2, 3, 5)>
<1, (2, 5, 3)>
<4, (3, 5, 1)>
<4, (3, 5, 1)>
<4, (5, 3, 1)>
<4, (5, 3, 1)>
<6, (0, 3, 6)>
<6, (3, 0, 6)>
<7, (0, 9, 7)>
<7, (7, 0, 9)>

Count of 3-stars: [12]
