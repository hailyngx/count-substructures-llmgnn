Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 8

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in the form of a 3-star. Let's go through the nodes one by one:

- Node 0: Not part of any 3-star.
- Node 1: Forms a 3-star with nodes (4, 6, 9). <1, (4, 6, 9)>
- Node 2: Not part of any 3-star.
- Node 3: Not part of any 3-star.
- Node 4: Forms two 3-stars, with nodes (0, 1, 9) and (2, 5, 9). <4, (0, 1, 9)>, <4, (2, 5, 9)>
- Node 5: Not part of any 3-star.
- Node 6: Not part of any 3-star.
- Node 7: Not part of any 3-star.
- Node 8: Not part of any 3-star.
- Node 9: Forms a 3-star with nodes (1, 4, 8). <9, (1, 4, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4]. 
The unique 3-stars are: <1, (4, 6, 9)>, <4, (0, 1, 9)>, <4, (2, 5, 9)>, <9, (1, 4, 8)>.
