Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, creating a 3-star structure. 

Let's identify the 3-star structures present in the graph: 

<1, (3, 4, 5)>
<1, (3, 5, 7)>
<1, (4, 5, 7)>
<3, (1, 6, 7)>
<7, (2, 6, 9)>
<7, (3, 4, 6)>
