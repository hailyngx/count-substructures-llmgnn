Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (2, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star-like pattern.

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph step-by-step:
1. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 4, and 2. 
2. Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 4, and 9. 
3. Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 6, and 5.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].

Unique 3-stars:
<1, (6, 4, 2)>
<6, (1, 4, 9)>
<4, (2, 6, 5)>
