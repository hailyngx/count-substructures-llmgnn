Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list the unique 3-stars present in the graph:

<0, (1, 2, 9)>
<1, (0, 4, 8)>
<2, (0, 6, 7)>
<4, (1, 7, 9)>
<7, (2, 4, 9)>
<8, (1, 2, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
