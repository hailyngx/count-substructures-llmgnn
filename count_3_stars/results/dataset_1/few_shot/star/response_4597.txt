Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 6

Response:
Let's start by identifying 3-stars in the given graph:

- For node 0: <0, (2, 3)>
- For node 2: <2, (0, 5, 7)>
- For node 4: <4, (1, 6, 7)> and <4, (1, 7, 8)>
- For node 7: <7, (2, 4, 8)>
- For node 8: <8, (1, 4, 7)>
- For node 9: <9, (3, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
