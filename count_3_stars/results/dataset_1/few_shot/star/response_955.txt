Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes (3 leaves) forming a 3-star.

Looking at the adjacency list, we can see that the nodes are connected as follows:
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 4, and 9: <2, (0, 4, 9)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 5, and 6: <4, (2, 5, 6)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 4, and 8: <6, (3, 4, 8)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 7, and 8: <9, (1, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
