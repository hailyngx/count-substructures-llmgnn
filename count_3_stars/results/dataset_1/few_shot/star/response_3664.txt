Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 8

Response:
Based on the given graph and the definition of a 3-star, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph.

The possible 3-stars can be formed around the center node 0. Let's explore the combinations of 3-stars with the center node 0:

1. <0, (2, 3, 5)>
2. <0, (2, 3, 6)>
3. <0, (2, 5, 6)>
4. <0, (3, 5, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (2, 3, 5)>.
