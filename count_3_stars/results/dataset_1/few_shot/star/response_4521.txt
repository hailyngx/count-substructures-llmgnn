Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to find all the unique 3-stars in the graph.

Based on the definition provided, a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (2, 6, 7)>
<0, (2, 6, 9)>
<0, (6, 7, 9)>
<2, (0, 6, 8)>
<6, (0, 1, 7)>
<6, (0, 3, 5)>
<7, (0, 1, 8)>
<8, (2, 4, 9)>
  
Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars: [8].
