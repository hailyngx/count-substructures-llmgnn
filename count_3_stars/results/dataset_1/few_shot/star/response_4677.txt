Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node and the nodes connected to it in a star pattern. 
From the adjacency list, we can determine the 3-stars in the graph. Let's list them:

<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<2, (0, 6, 7)>
<4, (1, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
