Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (2, 6) (3, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 7
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars present. 

From the adjacency list, we can see that the potential central nodes for the 3-stars are nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 7, 9.

Now, let's analyze each potential central node and find their connected nodes to form 3-stars:

1. Node 0:
   - Connected nodes: 1, 5
   - 3-stars: None

2. Node 1:
   - Connected nodes: 0
   - 3-stars: None

3. Node 2:
   - Connected nodes: 6
   - 3-stars: None

4. Node 3:
   - Connected nodes: 7
   - 3-stars: None

5. Node 7:
   - Connected nodes: 3, 8
   - 3-stars: <7, (3, 8, 9)>

6. Node 9:
   - Connected nodes: 8
   - 3-stars: None

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1] and the unique 3-star found is <7, (3, 8, 9)>.
