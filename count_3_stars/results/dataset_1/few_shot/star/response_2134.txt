Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, and node 8

Response:
Based on the given graph information, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:

To form a 3-star, we need a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify all such 3-stars:

- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 5, and 8: <2, (1, 5, 8)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 4, and 6: <3, (0, 4, 6)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 4, and 7: <5, (2, 4, 7)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 6, and 8: <9, (0, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
