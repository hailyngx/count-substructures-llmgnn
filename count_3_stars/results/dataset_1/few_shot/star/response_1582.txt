Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 9
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 4

Response:
To find all the 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that have exactly three neighbors (i.e., nodes that form a 3-star configuration with the central node). 

Based on the adjacency list provided, the nodes that have exactly three neighbors are:
- Node 5 with neighbors 0, 4, and 8
- Node 7 with neighbors 1, 4, and a leaf node not specified
- Node 8 with neighbors 1, 5, and a leaf node not specified
- Node 9 with neighbors 0, 2, and 4

To find the final count of 3-stars, we need to consider the possible configurations for nodes 7 and 8 separately due to unspecified leaf nodes. Let's list the unique 3-stars found:

<5, (0, 4, 8)>
<7, (1, 4, x)>
<8, (1, 5, y)>
<9, (0, 2, 4)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [(4)].
