Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 7
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the 3-stars. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Looking at the adjacency list:
- Node 0 is not part of any 3-star.
- Node 1 has 3-stars: <1, (0, 2, 5)> and <1, (5, 6, 7)>.
- Node 2 has 3-star: <2, (1, 5, 6)>.
- Node 3 is not part of any 3-star.
- Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
- Node 5 has 3-star: <5, (1, 2, 6)>.
- Node 6 has 3-star: <6, (1, 2, 5)>.
- Node 7 has 3-stars: <7, (3, 5, 6)> and <7, (5, 6, 8)> and <7, (6, 8, 9)>.
- Node 8 is not part of any 3-star.
- Node 9 is not part of any 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8]. 
The unique 3-stars are <1, (0, 2, 5)>, <1, (5, 6, 7)>, <2, (1, 5, 6)>, <5, (1, 2, 6)>, <6, (1, 2, 5)>, <7, (3, 5, 6)>, <7, (5, 6, 8)>, and <7, (6, 8, 9)>.
