Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 8) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 4

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern. 

In this graph, considering the adjacency list for each node, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (2, 6, 7)>
<1, (5, 7, 8)>
<2, (0, 8, 9)>
<4, (8, 9, 0)>
<8, (1, 2, 4)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we get 5. 
Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
