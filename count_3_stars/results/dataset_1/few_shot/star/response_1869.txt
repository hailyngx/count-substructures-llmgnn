Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 8

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0: No 3-stars as it has less than 3 neighbors.
2. Node 1: No 3-stars as it has less than 3 neighbors.
3. Node 2: <2, (0, 1, 6)>, <2, (0, 8, 9)>, <2, (1, 7, 8)>, <2, (6, 7, 8)>
4. Node 3: No 3-stars as it has less than 3 neighbors.
5. Node 4: No 3-stars as it has less than 3 neighbors.
6. Node 5: No 3-stars as it has less than 3 neighbors.
7. Node 6: No 3-stars as it has less than 3 neighbors.
8. Node 7: No 3-stars as it has less than 3 neighbors.
9. Node 8: No 3-stars as it has less than 3 neighbors.
10. Node 9: <9, (0, 3, 8)>, <9, (0, 4, 8)>, <9, (3, 8, 0)>, <9, (4, 8, 0)>

Number of 3-stars: [8]
Unique 3-stars: <2, (0, 1, 6)>, <2, (0, 8, 9)>, <2, (1, 7, 8)>, <2, (6, 7, 8)>, <9, (0, 3, 8)>, <9, (0, 4, 8)>, <9, (3, 8, 0)>, <9, (4, 8, 0)>
