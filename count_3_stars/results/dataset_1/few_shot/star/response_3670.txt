Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Based on the provided adjacency list:
- Node 0 is not connected to exactly three other nodes.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 5, 7, and 9. But it forms one 3-star: <1, (2, 4, 5)>.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 6, 8, and 9. It forms one 3-star: <2, (1, 6, 8)>.
- Node 3 is not connected to exactly three other nodes.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 8. But it forms one 3-star: <4, (1, 5, 8)>.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 6, and 8. It forms one 3-star: <5, (1, 6, 8)>.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 5, and 9. It forms one 3-star: <6, (0, 5, 9)>.
- Node 7 is not connected to exactly three other nodes.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 5, and 9. But it forms one 3-star: <8, (2, 4, 5)>.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 6, 7, and 8. It forms one 3-star: <9, (1, 6, 8)>.

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
