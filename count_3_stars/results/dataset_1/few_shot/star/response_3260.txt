Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-star structures:

<0, (4, 8, 0)>
<1, (7, 8, 9)>
<3, (2, 4, 8)>
<8, (0, 1, 9)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
