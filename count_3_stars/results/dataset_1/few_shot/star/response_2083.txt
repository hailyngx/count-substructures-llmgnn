Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 3

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the unique 3-stars in the graph based on the given information. 

Based on the definition of a 3-star graph, each 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's identify the 3-stars:

1. <0, (1, 2, 3)>
2. <2, (1, 0, 6)>
3. <2, (1, 0, 7)>
4. <2, (6, 0, 1)>
5. <2, (7, 0, 1)>
6. <2, (6, 7, 8)>
7. <2, (7, 6, 8)>
8. <2, (8, 7, 6)>
9. <2, (7, 8, 4)>
10. <2, (8, 7, 4)>
11. <2, (4, 8, 7)>
12. <3, (4, 7, 9)>
13. <3, (9, 7, 4)>
14. <3, (7, 4, 9)>
15. <7, (5, 8, 2)>
16. <7, (8, 5, 2)>

Count of 3-stars: [16]
