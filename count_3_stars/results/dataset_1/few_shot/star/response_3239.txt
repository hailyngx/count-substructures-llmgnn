Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 8

Response:
First, let's find the 3-stars in the given graph. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (3, 5)>
<1, (3, 5, 6)>
<5, (0, 1, 4)>
<8, (1, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4]. 

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (3, 5)>
<1, (3, 5, 6)>
<5, (0, 1, 4)>
<8, (1, 6, 7)>
