Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes (forming a 3-star pattern).

Looking at the adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-star patterns:
1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 4 (remaining connected nodes: 7)
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 5 (remaining connected nodes: 6)
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 4 (remaining connected nodes: 6, 9)
4. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 6
5. Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 6, and 8
6. Node 8 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and potentially forms another 3-star pattern.

Therefore, the count of 3-stars can be represented as follows:
[7]

The unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<1, (0, 2, 5)>
<2, (0, 1, 4)>
<4, (0, 2, 6)>
<5, (1, 6, 8)>
<8, (5, 6, 8)>
