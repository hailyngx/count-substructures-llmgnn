Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for all possible combinations where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Observations:
1. Node 1 can form 3-stars with nodes 3 and 9.
2. Node 2 can form 3-stars with nodes 3 and 5, and with nodes 3 and 6.
3. Node 3 can form 3-stars with nodes 1, 2, and 8; and with nodes 2, 4, and 5.
4. Node 4 can form a 3-star with nodes 3, 5, and 8.
5. Node 5 can form a 3-star with nodes 2, 3, and 9.
6. Node 6 does not have any 3-star configurations.
7. Node 7 does not have any connections to form 3-stars.
8. Node 8 does not have any additional 3-star configurations.
9. Node 9 can form a 3-star with nodes 1, 5, and 5.

Based on the observations, the total number of unique 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
