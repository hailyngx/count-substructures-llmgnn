Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 8

Response:
There are 3 unique 3-star structures in this graph:

<0, (5, 6, 9)>
<3, (1, 2, 6)>
<9, (0, 3, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
