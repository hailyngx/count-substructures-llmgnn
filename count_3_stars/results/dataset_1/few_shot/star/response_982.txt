Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all possible 3-stars by looking for central nodes with exactly three adjacent nodes (leaves). We'll start by examining each node to see if it forms a 3-star.

Let's list the 3-stars we find:

<0, (4, 9, 0)>
<1, (6, 8, 1)>
<2, (3, 6, 7)>
<4, (0, 5, 7)>
<6, (1, 2, 9)>
<8, (1, 9, 8)>
<9, (0, 6, 8)>

Count of 3-stars: [6]
