Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8)

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible 3-stars formed by a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step by step:

1. Identify central nodes: Nodes with exactly 3 outgoing edges are potential central nodes. In this graph, nodes 0, 1, 2, 5, and 9 qualify as central nodes.

2. For each central node:
   - Identify the connected nodes (leaves) linked to the central node.
   - Check if each combination of 3 connected nodes, along with the central node, forms a 3-star.

3. Count the total number of unique 3-stars found.

Let's proceed with finding the 3-stars:

1. For Central Node 0:
   - Possible 3-stars: <0, (2, 6, 8)>, <0, (2, 7, 8)>, <0, (7, 6, 8)>
   
2. For Central Node 1:
   - Possible 3-stars: <1, (4, 6, 7)>
   
3. For Central Node 2:
   - Possible 3-stars: <2, (0, 8, 6)>, <2, (6, 9, 8)>
   
4. For Central Node 5:
   - No 3-stars because it has only 2 outgoing edges.

5. For Central Node 9:
   - Possible 3-stars: <9, (2, 8, 4)>, <9, (7, 8, 4)>
   
Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5]. 

<0, (2, 6, 8)>, <0, (2, 7, 8)>, <0, (7, 6, 8)>, <1, (4, 6, 7)>, <2, (0, 8, 6)>, <2, (6, 9, 8)>, <9, (2, 8, 4)>, <9, (7, 8, 4)>
