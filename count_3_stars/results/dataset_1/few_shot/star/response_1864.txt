Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 7, and node 8

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the graph can be counted by finding the number of unique 3-stars.

Let's list the 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (5, 7, 8)>
<0, (5, 7, 9)>
<0, (5, 8, 9)>
<0, (7, 8, 9)>
<1, (5, 8, 9)>
<2, (7, 8, 9)>
<4, (7, 9, 8)>
<6, (7, 8, 9)>

There are a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
