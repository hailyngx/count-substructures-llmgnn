Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 6, and node 8

Response:
The first step is to identify all the 3-stars in the given graph. 

Next, we will list out all the unique 3-stars found in the graph in the format <Center, (Leaf1, Leaf2, Leaf3)>. Then we will count the total number of 3-stars.

This will give us the final answer in brackets [].

Let's start by listing out the unique 3-stars found:

<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<0, (2, 3, 5)>
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<1, (2, 6, 7)>
<1, (6, 7, 8)>
<2, (0, 1, 7)>
<2, (0, 5, 7)>
<3, (0, 5, 8)>
<7, (1, 2, 5)>
<8, (1, 3, 6)>
<8, (3, 6, 9)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars gives us a total of [12].
