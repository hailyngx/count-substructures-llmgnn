Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph step by step:

1. Identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
   - Node 3: Connected to nodes 0, 1, and 2
   - Node 4: Connected to nodes 1, 2, and 5
   - Node 5: Connected to nodes 1, 4, and 7
   - Node 6: Connected to nodes 3, 7, and 9
   - Node 7: Connected to nodes 1, 5, and 6
   - Node 9: Connected to nodes 4, 6, and 7

2. Count the number of unique 3-stars:
   - <3, (0, 1, 2)>
   - <4, (1, 2, 5)>
   - <5, (1, 4, 7)>
   - <6, (3, 7, 9)>
   - <7, (1, 5, 6)>
   - <9, (4, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
