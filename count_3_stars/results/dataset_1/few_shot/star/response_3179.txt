Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the 3-stars present. 

Let's look at each node in the graph to see if it is the center of a 3-star. 

Starting with Node 0:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, and 9. 
- This forms two possible 3-stars: <0, (1, 2, 4)> and <0, (1, 2, 9)>.

Moving to Node 1:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 5, 6, and 9.
- This forms one possible 3-star: <1, (0, 2, 5)>.

Moving to Node 2:
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 5, 6, and 8. 
- This forms no 3-stars.

Node 3 does not have enough connections to form a 3-star.

Moving to Node 4:
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 8.
- This forms no 3-stars.

Moving to Node 5:
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 7.
- This forms no 3-stars.

Moving to Node 6:
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 9.
- This forms no 3-stars.

Node 7 does not have enough connections to form a 3-star.

Node 8 and Node 9 also do not have enough connections to form 3-stars.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are:
<0, (1, 2, 4)>, <0, (1, 2, 9)>, <1, (0, 2, 5)>

There are [3] 3-stars in the given graph.
