Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we can easily identify the 3-stars in the graph:
1. <0, (2, 6, 9)>
2. <1, (2, 3, )>
3. <5, (2, 4, 6)>
4. <7, (5, 8, )>
5. <9, (0, 8, )>

Therefore, there are a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
