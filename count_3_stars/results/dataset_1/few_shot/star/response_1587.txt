Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 2

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. In this case, we are looking for nodes that are connected in a star pattern where one node is at the center and the other three are leaves.

Looking at the adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-star configurations:
1. Node 0: (0, 8, 9)
2. Node 2: (2, 3, 9)
3. Node 3: (3, 1, 2)
4. Node 5: (5, 4, 6)
5. Node 6: (6, 3, 5)
6. Node 7: (7, 2, 4)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
<0, (8, 9)>
<2, (3, 9)>
<3, (1, 2)>
<5, (4, 6)>
<6, (3, 5)>
<7, (2, 4)>
