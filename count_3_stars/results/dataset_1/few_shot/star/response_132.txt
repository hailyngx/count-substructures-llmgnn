Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of nodes where one node (the center) is connected to exactly three other nodes (the leaves).

Let's go through each node in the graph and check if it forms a 3-star with its adjacent nodes:

1. Node 0: (0, 3, 6, 9)
    - Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 6, and 9. <0, (3, 6, 9)>

2. Node 1: (1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9)
    - Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 4, and 9. <1, (2, 4, 9)>
    - Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 7, and 9. <1, (5, 7, 9)>

3. Node 2: (2, 1, 4, 9)
    - Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 4, and 9. <2, (1, 4, 9)>

4. Node 3: (3, 0, 4)
    - Node 3 does not form a 3-star.

5. Node 4: (4, 1, 2, 3, 6, 9)
    - Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 2, and 9. <4, (1, 2, 9)>

6. Node 5: (5, 1, 6, 7, 8)
    - Node 5 does not form a 3-star.

7. Node 6: (6, 0, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9)
    - Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 4, and 9. <6, (0, 4, 9)>
    - Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 7, and 8. <6, (5, 7, 8)>

8. Node 7: (7, 1, 5, 6, 8, 9)
    - Node 7 does not form a 3-star.

9. Node 8: (8, 5, 6, 7)
    - Node 8 does not form a 3-star.

10. Node 9: (9, 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7)
    - Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, and 9. <9, (0, 1, 9)>
    - Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 6, and 9. <9, (4, 6, 9)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
The unique 3-stars are: <0, (3, 6, 9)>, <1, (2, 4, 9)>, <1, (5, 7, 9)>, <2, (1, 4, 9)>, <4, (1, 2, 9)>, <6, (0, 4, 9)>, and <6, (5, 7, 8)>.
