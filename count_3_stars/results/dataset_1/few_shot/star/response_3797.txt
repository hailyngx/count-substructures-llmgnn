Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star pattern. 

Given the definition of a 3-star graph, we look for nodes that have exactly 3 edges connected to them. These nodes will act as the central nodes of potential 3-star graphs. We then identify the other nodes connected to these central nodes and list them in a 3-star pattern. 

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 1: (2, 3, 8)
2. Node 2: (1, 5, 9)
3. Node 3: (1, 7, 8)
4. Node 6: (7, 8, 9)

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
The unique 3-stars are <1, (2, 3, 8)>, <2, (1, 5, 9)>, <3, (1, 7, 8)>, and <6, (7, 8, 9)>.
