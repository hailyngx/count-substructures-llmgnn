Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 3

Response:
The 10 nodes are connected in the following way to form the given graph:

<0, (9)>
<1, (6, 7)>
<2, (7)>
<3, (9)>
<4, (6, 7)>
<5, (8)>
<6, (1, 4)>
<7, (1, 2, 4)>
<8, (5)>
<9, (0, 3)>

To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to find all possible 3-stars. Let's count them.

<1, (6, 7)>, <1, (7, 2)>, <1, (7, 4)>
<4, (6, 1)>, <4, (6, 7)>, <4, (7, 2)>, <4, (7, 1)>
<7, (1, 2)>, <7, (1, 4)>, <7, (2, 1)>, <7, (2, 4)>, <7, (4, 1)>, <7, (4, 6)>
