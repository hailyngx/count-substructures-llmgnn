Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 9) (7, 4) (7, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 7

Response:
Given the graph information, we can identify the 3-stars based on the definition provided in the beginning. Let's find them step by step.

1. Identify all nodes connected to exactly three other nodes:
   - Node 0, Node 2, Node 4, Node 5, Node 7, and Node 9 are connected to exactly three other nodes.

2. For each of these nodes, check if they form a 3-star:
   - Node 0: (0, 1, 2, 4), (0, 1, 4, 7)
   - Node 2: (2, 0, 9, 5)
   - Node 4: (4, 0, 7, 9)
   - Node 5: (5, 1, 9, 2), (5, 1, 9, 7)
   - Node 7: (7, 4, 9, 5)

3. Count the total number of unique 3-stars formed:
   - Total unique 3-stars: 8

Therefore, the final answer is [8].

List of unique 3-stars: 
<0, (1, 2, 4)> 
<0, (1, 4, 7)>
<2, (0, 5, 9)>
<4, (0, 7, 9)>
<5, (1, 9, 2)>
<5, (1, 9, 7)>
<7, (4, 9, 5)>
