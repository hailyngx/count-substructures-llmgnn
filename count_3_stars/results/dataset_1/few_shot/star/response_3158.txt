Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, 7, and node 8

Response:
Let's first identify the 3-stars in the given graph.
From the adjacency list, we can see that the central nodes and their corresponding leaves are as follows:
- Node 0: (5, 8, 9)
- Node 2: (7, 8, 9)
- Node 6: (4, 7, 8) and (7, 8, 9)
- Node 7: (2, 6, 8)
- Node 8: (0, 2, 9)
- Node 9: (0, 2, 8)
  
Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars:
- The 3-star with central node 0 and leaves 5, 8, 9: <0, (5, 8, 9)>
- The 3-star with central node 2 and leaves 7, 8, 9: <2, (7, 8, 9)>
- The 3-star with central node 6 and leaves 4, 7, 8: <6, (4, 7, 8)>
- The 3-star with central node 7 and leaves 2, 6, 8: <7, (2, 6, 8)>
- The 3-star with central node 8 and leaves 0, 2, 9: <8, (0, 2, 9)>
- The 3-star with central node 9 and leaves 0, 2, 8: <9, (0, 2, 8)>
