Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (4, 2) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 2
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0

Response:
Considering the definition of a 3-star graph, we need to find all the 3-stars in this graph. 

Let's analyze the graph and count the number of 3-stars step by step:

1. **Identify Central Nodes:** We need to find all nodes in the graph which are connected to exactly 3 other nodes.

   From the adjacency list:
   - Node 0, Node 1, Node 6, and Node 7 are connected to exactly 3 other nodes.

2. **Form 3-Stars:** For each central node, identify the unique 3-stars it belongs to.

   - For Node 0: <0, (1, 2, 7)> and <0, (1, 7, 9)>
   - For Node 1: <1, (0, 2, 6)> and <1, (0, 2, 7)>
   - For Node 6: <6, (1, 7, 8)>
   - For Node 7: <7, (0, 1, 2)> and <7, (1, 6, 8)>

Putting it all together:
