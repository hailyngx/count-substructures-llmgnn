Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 8

Response:
The 3-star in this graph can be identified by searching for nodes that are directly connected to exactly three other nodes. 
From the given information, we can see that the possible 3-stars in the graph are:

1. <0, (1, 2, 4)>
2. <0, (1, 2, 8)>
3. <1, (0, 6, 8)>
4. <2, (0, 6, 7)>
5. <2, (0, 6, 9)>
6. <2, (8, 9, 0)>
7. <8, (0, 1, 3)>
8. <8, (2, 9, 0)>
9. <9, (2, 8, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
