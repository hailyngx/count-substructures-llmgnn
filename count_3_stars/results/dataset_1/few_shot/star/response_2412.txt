Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 6

Response:
There are multiple steps involved in counting the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Identify all possible 3-stars in the graph by finding nodes that form a 3-star pattern around a central node.
   
2. Calculate the total count of unique 3-stars found in the graph.

Let's go ahead and list the unique 3-stars found in the graph and then determine the count of such 3-stars.
