Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Based on the provided information, the possible 3-star configurations are as follows:

<1, (2, 5, 6)>
<2, (1, 5, 9)>
<6, (2, 8, 9)>
<9, (2, 4, 6)>

Therefore, there are a total of [4] 3-stars in the given graph.
