Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

There are 10 nodes in total. To form a 3-star, we need a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's check each node to see if it is the center of a 3-star:

1. Node 0: Central node with 4 neighbors (2, 5, 8, 9)
- Possible 3-stars: <0, (2, 5, 8)>, <0, (2, 5, 9)>, <0, (2, 8, 9)>, <0, (5, 8, 9)>
  
2. Node 1: Central node with 4 neighbors (3, 4, 6, 9)
- Possible 3-stars: <1, (3, 4, 6)>, <1, (3, 4, 9)>, <1, (3, 6, 9)>, <1, (4, 6, 9)>

3. Node 2: Central node with 4 neighbors (0, 6, 7, 9)
- Possible 3-stars: <2, (0, 6, 7)>, <2, (0, 6, 9)>, <2, (0, 7, 9)>, <2, (6, 7, 9)>

4. Node 3: Not a central node of a 3-star.

5. Node 4: Not a central node of a 3-star.

6. Node 5: Central node with 2 neighbors (0, 7)
- Possible 3-stars: None (Not enough neighbors)

7. Node 6: Central node with 3 neighbors (1, 2, 8)
- Possible 3-stars: <6, (1, 2, 8)>

8. Node 7: Central node with 4 neighbors (2, 5, 8, 9)
- Possible 3-stars: <7, (2, 5, 8)>, <7, (2, 8, 9)>, <7, (5, 8, 9)>

9. Node 8: Central node with 5 neighbors (0, 3, 6, 7, 9)
- Possible 3-stars: <8, (0, 6, 7)>, <8, (0, 6, 9)>, <8, (0, 7, 9)>, <8, (6, 7, 9)>

10. Node 9: Central node with 5 neighbors (0, 1, 2, 7, 8)
- Possible 3-stars: <9, (0, 2, 7)>, <9, (0, 2, 8)>, <9, (0, 7, 8)>, <9, (2, 7, 8)>

Count of 3-stars: [14]
Unique 3-stars: <0, (2, 5, 8)>, <0, (2, 5, 9)>, <0, (2, 8, 9)>, <0, (5, 8, 9)>, <1, (3, 4, 6)>, <1, (3, 4, 9)>, <1, (3, 6, 9)>, <1, (4, 6, 9)>, <2, (0, 6, 7)>, <2, (0, 6, 9)>, <2, (0, 7, 9)>, <2, (6, 7, 9)>, <7, (2, 5, 8)>, <7, (2, 8, 9)>.
