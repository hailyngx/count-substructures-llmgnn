Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 5
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's determine the 3-star configurations:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 8, and 9: <0, (3, 8, 9)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 2, and 5: <3, (0, 2, 5)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, and 4: <5, (1, 3, 4)>

Therefore, there are [3] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
