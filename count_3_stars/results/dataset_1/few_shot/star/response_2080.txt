Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 6

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are as follows:
[5]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1].
