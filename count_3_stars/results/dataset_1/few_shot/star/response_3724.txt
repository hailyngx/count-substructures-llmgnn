Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will look for all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges, forming a 3-star pattern.

Let's list the 3-stars found in the graph:
<2, (3, 7, 8)>
<3, (2, 4, 5)>
<7, (2, 8, 9)>
<8, (2, 7, 3)>
<9, (3, 7, ...)> (Note: Node 9 only has two connections)

Count of 3-stars in the graph: [4]
