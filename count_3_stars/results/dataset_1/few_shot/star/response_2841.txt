Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 2

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for all instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through the nodes one by one to identify the 3-stars:

- Node 0: Not a central node.
- Node 1: <1, (3, 5, 7)>
- Node 2: Not a central node.
- Node 3: <3, (1, 4, 5)>
- Node 4: <4, (2, 3, 8)>
- Node 5: <5, (1, 2, 3)>
- Node 6: Not a central node.
- Node 7: Not a central node.
- Node 8: Not a central node.
- Node 9: Not a central node.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [3]. 

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<1, (3, 5, 7)>
<3, (1, 4, 5)>
<4, (2, 3, 8)>
