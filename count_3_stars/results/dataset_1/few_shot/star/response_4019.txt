Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 4

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph. 

From the adjacency list, we can see that the possible 3-stars with a central node and three leaves are: 
<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<3, (1, 2, 5)>
<6, (0, 1, 3)>
<7, (6, 8, 0)>
<8, (0, 1, 3)>
<9, (0, 1, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6]. 
So, the unique 3-stars found are: <0, (1, 4, 6)>, <1, (0, 2, 3)>, <3, (1, 2, 5)>, <6, (0, 1, 3)>, <7, (6, 8, 0)>, and <9, (0, 1, 4)>.
