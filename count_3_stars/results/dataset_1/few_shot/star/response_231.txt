Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern, i.e., a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<2, (3, 4, 5)>
<2, (3, 8, 9)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<3, (2, 7, 9)>
<7, (3, 5, 6)>
<7, (5, 6, 8)>
<8, (2, 7, 9)>

Therefore, there are a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
