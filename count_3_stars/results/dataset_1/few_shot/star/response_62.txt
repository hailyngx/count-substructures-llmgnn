Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 8

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph:

- Node 0: <0, (3, 4, 5)>
- Node 5: <5, (0, 1, 2)>
- Node 1: <1, (5, 6, 7)>
- Node 8: <8, (1, 5, 7)>
- Node 7: <7, (0, 1, 5)>
- Node 4: <4, (0, 5, 6)>
- Node 6: <6, (1, 4, 9)>
- Node 9: <9, (0, 6, 8)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-star graphs in the given graph:
