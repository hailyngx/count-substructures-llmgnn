Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 9
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 5

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are:
<0, (4, 5, 1)>
<1, (2, 5, 0)>
<1, (4, 5, 9)>
<2, (1, 8, 3)>
<4, (0, 9, 1)>
<5, (0, 9, 1)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
