Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 3
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Let's identify the 3-stars one by one based on the given information.

1. Node 2: (2, 3, 4), (2, 3, 5)
2. Node 3: (3, 1, 8), (3, 2, 4)
3. Node 4: (4, 2, 5)
4. Node 8: (8, 0, 1), (8, 1, 3), (8, 0, 3)

Therefore, we have found a total of <2, (3, 4, 5)>, <3, (1, 8, 0)>, <3, (1, 2, 4)>, <4, (2, 5, 3)>, <8, (1, 3, 0)> as the 3-stars in the graph.

Count: [5]
