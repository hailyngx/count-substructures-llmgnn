Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 4, 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star by finding the central node and its three neighboring nodes.

Looking at the adjacency list, the possible 3-stars can be found as follows:

1. Central node 0:
   <0, (4, 6, 8)>
   
2. Central node 1:
   <1, (3, 8, 9)>
   
3. Central node 3:
   <3, (1, 8, 9)>
   
4. Central node 4:
   <4, (0, 8, 9)>
   
5. Central node 6:
   <6, (0, 9, 8)>
   
6. Central node 8:
   <8, (0, 1, 3)>
   
7. Central node 9:
   <9, (3, 4, 6)>

Therefore, there are a total of [7] 3-stars in the given graph.
