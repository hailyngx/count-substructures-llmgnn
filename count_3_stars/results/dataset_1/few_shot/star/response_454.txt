Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 7, and node 8

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph.

We can start by identifying which nodes can act as the center of a 3-star. Nodes with degree 3 can be potential centers for a 3-star.

Candidates for central nodes:
- Node 3 with degree 3
- Node 4 with degree 3
- Node 5 with degree 3
- Node 6 with degree 4

Now, let's consider each potential central node and see if it can form a 3-star.

For Node 3:
- <3, (0, 2, 4)>
- <3, (5, 6, 8)>

For Node 4:
- <4, (1, 3, 8)>

For Node 5:
- <5, (0, 2, 6)>
- <5, (8, 3, 1)>

For Node 6:
- <6, (0, 1, 2)>
- <6, (8, 1, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
