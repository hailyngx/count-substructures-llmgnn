Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the 3-stars. As per the definition, a 3-star consists of a center connected to exactly three other nodes.

Here are the unique 3-stars in the given graph:
<1, (5, 6, 3)>
<1, (5, 6, 4)>
<3, (5, 9, 7)>
<6, (1, 8, 4)>
<6, (5, 8, 9)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
