Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 5, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will look for each central node connected to exactly three neighbors. 

Here are the 3-stars found in the graph:
[10]

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (2, 6, 7)>
<1, (2, 3, 5)>
<2, (0, 1, 4)>
<3, (1, 6, 9)>
<5, (1, 4, 8)>
<9, (1, 8, 5)>
<4, (2, 9, 5)>
<6, (0, 1, 3)>
<8, (3, 5, 9)>
<7, (0, 3, 6)>
