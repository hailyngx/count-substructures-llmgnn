Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 7

Response:
Based on the given information, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 7 and 8. This forms one 3-star: <0, (7, 8)>
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 8. This forms one 3-star: <1, (3, 5, 8)>
3. Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 6, and 8. This forms one 3-star: <3, (1, 6, 8)>
4. Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 7. This forms one 3-star: <4, (2, 5, 7)>
5. Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 9. This forms one 3-star: <7, (0, 4, 9)>
6. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 5. This forms one 3-star: <8, (0, 1, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
