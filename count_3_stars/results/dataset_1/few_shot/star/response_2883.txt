Response:
I will now find the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

To form a 3-star, we need a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through each node in the graph and see which nodes fulfill this condition.

Starting from node 0:
Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 5, and 6. <0, (3, 5, 6)>
Node 0 forms another 3-star with nodes 3, 5, and 8. <0, (3, 5, 8)>

Moving on to node 1:
Node 1 does not form any 3-star as it is connected to only 2 other nodes.

Looking at node 2:
Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 6, and 7. <2, (3, 6, 7)>

Node 3:
Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 2, and 7. <3, (0, 2, 7)>

Node 4:
Node 4 does not form any 3-star as it is connected to only 2 other nodes.

Node 5:
Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 7, and 9. <5, (0, 7, 9)>

Node 6:
Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 2, and 8. <6, (0, 2, 8)>

Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, and 9. <7, (1, 3, 9)>

Node 8:
Node 8 does not form any 3-star as it is connected to only 2 other nodes.

Node 9:
Node 9 does not form any 3-star as it is connected to only 2 other nodes.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].

The 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<0, (3, 5, 8)>
<2, (3, 6, 7)>
<3, (0, 2, 7)>
<5, (0, 7, 9)>
