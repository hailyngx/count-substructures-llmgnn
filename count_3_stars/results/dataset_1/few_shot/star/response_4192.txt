Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph based on the definition provided:

1. From the adjacency list:
   - Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 5, and 8: <0, (3, 5, 8)>
   - Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 3, and 6: <1, (2, 3, 6)>
   - Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 4, and 6: <2, (1, 4, 6)>
   - Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, and 4: <3, (0, 1, 4)>
   - Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 3, and 5: <4, (2, 3, 5)>
   - Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 4, and 7: <5, (0, 4, 7)>
   - Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 2, and 4: <6, (1, 2, 4)>
   - Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 4, and 9: <7, (3, 4, 9)>
   - Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 3, and 9: <8, (0, 3, 9)>
   - Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 7, and 8: <9, (2, 7, 8)>

Count of 3-stars in the given graph: [9]
