Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify the 3-stars based on the definition provided.

We need to look for nodes that have exactly three edges incident upon them. These nodes will serve as the centers of the 3-stars. Then, for each of these nodes, we will check if their neighbors form a star pattern. A star pattern consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's identify and list all the unique 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 1: (2, 5, 8) - This forms a 3-star with node 1 as the center and nodes 2, 5, 8 as leaves.
2. Node 3: (5, 6, 8) - This forms a 3-star with node 3 as the center and nodes 5, 6, 8 as leaves.
3. Node 9: (1, 4, 7) - This forms a 3-star with node 9 as the center and nodes 1, 4, 7 as leaves.

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars in the given graph and output the final answer inside brackets []. 

[3] 

List of unique 3-stars:
<1, (2, 5, 8)>
<3, (5, 6, 8)>
<9, (1, 4, 7)>
