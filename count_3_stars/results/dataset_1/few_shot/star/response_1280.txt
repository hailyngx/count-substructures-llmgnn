Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, and node 8

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible instances of 3-stars. 

Examining the graph:

<0, (6, 9)>
<1, (3, 9)>
<2, (3, 4, 5)>
<3, (1, 2, 4), (3, 7, 9)>
<4, (2, 3, 8), (4, 9)>
<5, (2, 7)>
<6, (0, 7, 8), (6, 9)>
<7, (3, 5, 6)>
<8, (4, 6, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 8)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars found:
