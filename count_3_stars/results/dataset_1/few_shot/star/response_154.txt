Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8)

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can identify all the 3-stars with unique configurations. Here are the steps to find them:

1. Identify all possible 3-stars:
   - For each node in the graph, check if it is the center of a 3-star. A 3-star will have the center connected to exactly three other nodes.
   
2. List the unique 3-stars:
   - Avoid counting the same 3-star configuration multiple times.

Let's start by identifying the 3-stars in the given graph:

Node 0: (0, 1, 2), (0, 1, 3), (0, 1, 6), (0, 1, 9)
Node 1: (1, 0, 2), (1, 0, 4), (1, 0, 6), (1, 0, 8)
Node 2: (2, 0, 1), (2, 0, 3), (2, 0, 4), (2, 0, 6)
Node 3: (3, 0, 2), (3, 0, 7)
Node 4: (4, 1, 2), (4, 1, 6), (4, 1, 8)
Node 6: (6, 0, 1), (6, 0, 2), (6, 0, 4)
Node 8: (8, 1, 4), (8, 1, 7), (8, 1, 9)
Node 9: (9, 0, 8)

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 2, 3)>, <0, (1, 6, 9)>, <1, (0, 4, 8)>, <2, (0, 3, 4)>, <3, (0, 2, 7)>, <4, (1, 6, 8)>, <6, (0, 2, 4)>, <8, (1, 4, 7)>, <9, (0, 8)>
   
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
