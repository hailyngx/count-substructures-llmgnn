Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 6) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 8

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a star-like structure. 

Analyzing the given graph, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<2, (0, 8, 9)>
<6, (1, 3, 5)>
<6, (4, 7, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
