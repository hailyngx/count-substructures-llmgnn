Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify the central nodes and their corresponding leaves. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we can identify the nodes connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will serve as the central nodes for the 3-stars.

Given the adjacency list, the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes are:
- Node 0 (connected to 1, 2, 4)
- Node 1 (connected to 2, 6, 9)
- Node 3 (connected to 2, 5, 8)
- Node 4 (connected to 7, 9, 0)
- Node 5 (connected to 2, 3, 6)
- Node 6 (connected to 1, 2, 8)

Next, we construct the 3-stars using the central nodes and their connected nodes. 

So the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<1, (2, 6, 9)>
<3, (2, 5, 8)>
<4, (7, 9, 0)>
<5, (2, 3, 6)>
<6, (1, 2, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
