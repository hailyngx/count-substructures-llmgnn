Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 8
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Looking at the adjacency list provided, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<1, (0, 2, 5)>
<2, (0, 1, 8)>
<4, (0, 6, 8)>
<5, (1, 8, 0)>
<6, (4, 8, 0)>
<8, (1, 2, 5)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we get [7].
