Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 5, 7, and node 8

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

Since a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can identify them by looking at nodes with three edges. Let's list them first:

- Nodes with 3 edges: Node 1, Node 7, Node 8, and Node 9

Now, we can list the 3-stars by considering each of these nodes as the center and listing the nodes they are connected to:

<1, (2, 6, 7)>
<7, (1, 3, 9)>
<8, (0, 1, 9)>
<9, (0, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
