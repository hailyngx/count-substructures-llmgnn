Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 5

Response:
There are five 3-stars in the given graph. Here is the breakdown of the 3-stars:

[5]

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<1, (0, 3, 5)>
<3, (0, 1, 8)>
<4, (0, 5, 8)>
<5, (1, 4, 9)>
