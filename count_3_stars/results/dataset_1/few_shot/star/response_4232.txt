Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (2, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, 7, and node 8

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are as follows:
<0, (7, 9, 3)>
<6, (3, 4, 5)>
<7, (0, 6, 9)>
<9, (0, 7, 3)>
<9, (0, 7, 8)>
<2, (5, 6, 5)>
