Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are central nodes of 3-stars. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the graph and the adjacency list provided, we can find the following 3-stars:
<2, (4, 7, 8)>
<3, (5, 6, 9)>
<4, (0, 2, 5)>
<5, (0, 3, 4)>
<9, (3, 5, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
