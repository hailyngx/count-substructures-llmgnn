Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 4, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star-like configuration.

From the adjacency list given, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (5, 6, 9)>
<1, (4, 6, 9)>
<2, (4, 5, 9)>
<3, (7, 8, 9)>
<5, (0, 2, 8)>
<6, (0, 1, 8)>
<7, (3, 4, N)>
<8, (3, 4, 9)>
<9, (0, 2, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
