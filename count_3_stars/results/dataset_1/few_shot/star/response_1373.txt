Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern with that node as the center.

Since a 3-star has a center node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can identify 3-stars by looking for nodes with degree 3 in the graph.

From the adjacency list provided, the nodes with degree 3 are:
- Node 2: Connected to nodes 0, 5, 7
- Node 7: Connected to nodes 2, 5
- Node 8: Connected to nodes 1, 4

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars in the graph based on the identified center nodes:

1. Node 2 as center:
<2, (0, 5, 7)>

2. Node 7 as center:
<7, (2, 5, x)> (Only one unique 3-star as it shares nodes with the 3-star centered at node 2)

3. Node 8 as center:
<8, (1, 4, x)> (Only one unique 3-star as it shares nodes with the 3-star centered at node 2)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
