Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Each such instance forms a 3-star.

Let's go through each node to identify the 3-stars:

Node 0:
- <0, (2, 5, 9)>

Node 1:
- <1, (4, 7, 8)>

Node 2:
- <2, (0, 5, 6)>

Node 3:
- No 3-star as it is not connected to exactly three other nodes.

Node 4:
- No 3-star as it is not a central node of any 3-star.

Node 5:
- <5, (0, 2, 4)>
- <5, (0, 4, 9)>
- <5, (2, 4, 9)>
- <5, (4, 8, 9)>

Node 6:
- No 3-star as it is not connected to exactly three other nodes.

Node 7:
- No 3-star as it is not a central node of any 3-star.

Node 8:
- <8, (1, 3, 7)>

Node 9:
- No 3-star as it is not a central node of any 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6]. 
The unique 3-stars are <0, (2, 5, 9)>, <1, (4, 7, 8)>, <2, (0, 5, 6)>, <5, (0, 2, 4)>, <5, (0, 4, 9)>, and <8, (1, 3, 7)>.
