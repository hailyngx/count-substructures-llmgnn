Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph and list them out, we need to find all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step-by-step to identify and count the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, and 5: <0, (1, 3, 5)>
2. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 2, and 4: <1, (0, 2, 4)>
3. Node 2 does not form a 3-star as it has only two neighbors.
4. Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 5, and 7: <3, (0, 5, 7)>
5. Node 4 does not form a 3-star as it has only two neighbors.
6. Node 5 forms two 3-stars: <5, (0, 2, 3)> and <5, (3, 6, 7)>
7. Node 6 does not form a 3-star as it has only two neighbors.
8. Node 7 does not form a 3-star as it has only two neighbors.
9. Node 8 does not form a 3-star as it has only two neighbors.
10. Node 9 does not form a 3-star as it is not connected to any nodes.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5]. The unique 3-stars found are <0, (1, 3, 5)>, <1, (0, 2, 4)>, <3, (0, 5, 7)>, <5, (0, 2, 3)>, and <5, (3, 6, 7)>.
