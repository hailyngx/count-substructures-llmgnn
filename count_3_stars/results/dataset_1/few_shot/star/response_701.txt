Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the 3-stars first. Since a 3-star has a center node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can look for nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them.

After analyzing the given graph information, we can see that there are two 3-stars in this graph.
The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<1, (7, 8, 9)>
<6, (0, 2, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
