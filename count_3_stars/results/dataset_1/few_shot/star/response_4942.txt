Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 2

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Here is a step-by-step breakdown to find and count the 3-stars:

1. Identify nodes connected to three other nodes:
   - Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 6, 8, and 9
   - Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 5, and 9
   - Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 6, 7, and 9
   - Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 6, 7, and 8
   - Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 5

2. Based on the connections, we can identify the following unique 3-stars:
   - <0, (2, 6, 8)>
   - <0, (2, 6, 9)>
   - <1, (3, 4, 5)>
   - <1, (3, 5, 9)>
   - <2, (0, 6, 7)>
   - <2, (0, 6, 9)>
   - <3, (1, 6, 7)>
   - <3, (1, 6, 9)>
   - <8, (0, 3, 5)>

3. Counting the total number of unique 3-stars found:
   - There are <b>[9]</b> unique 3-stars in the given graph.
