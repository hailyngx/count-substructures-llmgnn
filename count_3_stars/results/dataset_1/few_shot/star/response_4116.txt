Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star-like configuration.

Looking at the adjacency list, we can see that the nodes with exactly three neighbors are:
- Node 0: connected to nodes 3, 7, and 8
- Node 1: connected to nodes 3, 8, and no other
- Node 2: connected to nodes 3, 4, and 5
- Node 4: connected to nodes 2, 7, and 9
- Node 5: connected to nodes 2, 9, and no other
- Node 7: connected to nodes 0, 4, and 8

We can see that the nodes above don't form any 3-stars as none of them have exactly three connections with each other as nodes are merely connected with different other nodes. 

Therefore, there are no 3-stars in the given graph. 

So, the final answer is [0].
