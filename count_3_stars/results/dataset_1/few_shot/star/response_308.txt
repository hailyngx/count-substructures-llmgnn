Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for every possible central node and check if each one has exactly three neighbors. If it does, then we have a 3-star.

When we go through the graph, we find the following 3-stars:
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<1, (0, 3, 7)>
<3, (1, 2, 4)>
<4, (0, 3, 9)>
<5, (0, 3, 5)>
<6, (0, 2, 8)>
<8, (0, 2, 6)>
<9, (3, 4, 9)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is 8.
