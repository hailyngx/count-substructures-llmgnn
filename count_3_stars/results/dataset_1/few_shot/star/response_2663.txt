Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible 3-stars by looking for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

From the provided adjacency list and edge information, the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes are nodes 1, 4, 8, and 9. These nodes will serve as potential centers of 3-stars.

Let's count the 3-stars:

1. Node 1: (1, 4, 6), (1, 5, 0), (1, 7, 8) [3]
2. Node 4: (4, 1, 5), (4, 3, 9), (4, 6, 0) [3]
3. Node 8: (8, 1, 7), (8, 9, 3), (8, 0, 2) [3]
4. Node 9: (9, 3, 4), (9, 6, 8) [2]

[Total number of 3-stars: 11]
