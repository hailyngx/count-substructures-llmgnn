Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the adjacency list, the potential centers (nodes with exactly 3 neighbors) are nodes 1, 4, 5, 7, and 8.

Now, let's list the 3-stars in the graph:

<1, (3, 4, 5)>
<1, (4, 7, 9)>
<4, (1, 7, 9)>
<5, (1, 3, 8)>
<7, (0, 4, 8)>
<7, (4, 0, 8)>
<8, (5, 7, 3)>
<8, (7, 5, 3)>

Now, counting the total number of 3-stars: [8]
