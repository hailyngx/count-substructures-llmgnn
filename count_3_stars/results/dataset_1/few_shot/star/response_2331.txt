Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for each possible 3-star configuration, which consists of a center node and three leaf nodes connected to the center.

Given the graph's structure, the nodes and their connections with other nodes are as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 7
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 7
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 8, and 9
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 4 and 5
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 5, and 7
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 7
- Node 6 is connected to node 7
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, 5, and 6
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 2 and 9
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2 and 8

Now, we will go through each node as the potential center node and check for 3-star configurations.

Count of 3-stars: [6]

<0, (1, 2, 7)>
<1, (0, 4, 7)>
<2, (0, 8, 9)>
<3, (4, 5, NULL)>
<4, (1, 3, 5)>
<7, (0, 1, 4)>
