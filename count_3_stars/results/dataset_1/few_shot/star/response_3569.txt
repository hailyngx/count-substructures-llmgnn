Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (3, 1) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 5

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

The central nodes of the 3-stars are: 0, 1, 5, and 7. Let's count the number of 3-stars for each central node:
- For node 0: There is one 3-star with center node 0: <0, (1, 2, 9)>
- For node 1: There are two 3-stars with center node 1: <1, (0, 3, 7)> and <1, (5, 7, 1)>
- For node 5: There are two 3-stars with center node 5: <5, (1, 4, 9)> and <5, (6, 7, 9)>
- For node 7: There is one 3-star with center node 7: <7, (1, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6]. 
The unique 3-stars are <0, (1, 2, 9)>, <1, (0, 3, 7)>, <1, (5, 7, 1)>, <5, (1, 4, 9)>, <5, (6, 7, 9)>, and <7, (1, 6, 8)>.
