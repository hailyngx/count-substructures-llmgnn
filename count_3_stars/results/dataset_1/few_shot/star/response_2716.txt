Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.
