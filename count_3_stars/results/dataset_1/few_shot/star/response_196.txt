Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the possible 3-stars. Remember that a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Upon analyzing the graph and adjacency list, we can identify the 3-stars as follows:
<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<1, (0, 4, 8)>
<2, (0, 5, 6)>
<4, (1, 5, 6)>
<5, (0, 2, 4)>
<6, (0, 2, 4)>
<7, (5, 8, 9)>
<8, (1, 2, 5)>
<9, (1, 4, 5)>

Count of 3-stars: [9]
