Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the central node and its adjacent nodes that form 3-stars. A 3-star graph has a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's go through each node and its adjacent nodes to find the 3-stars:
1. Node 0: (1, 2, 3) -> <0, (1, 2, 3)>
2. Node 1: (0, 7, 9) -> <1, (0, 7, 9)>
3. Node 2: (0, 4, 5) -> <2, (0, 4, 5)>
4. Node 3: (0, 4, 5) -> <3, (0, 4, 5)>
5. Node 4: (2, 3, 8) -> <4, (2, 3, 8)>
6. Node 5: (2, 3, 6) and (5, 7, 8) -> <5, (2, 3, 6)>, <5, (5, 7, 8)>
7. Node 6: (5, 8) -> <6, (5, 8)>
8. Node 7: (0, 1, 5) -> <7, (0, 1, 5)>
9. Node 8: (4, 5, 6) -> <8, (4, 5, 6)>
10. Node 9: (1, 4) -> <9, (1, 4, 9)>

There are a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
