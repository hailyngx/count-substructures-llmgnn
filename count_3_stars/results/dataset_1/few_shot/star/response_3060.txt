Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

First, let's list down the 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (4, 7, 9)>
<3, (5, 7, 8)>
<4, (0, 5, 7)>
<9, (2, 3, 4)>

Since the given graph has only one of each unique configuration of a 3-star graph, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4]. 

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
