Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, and node 7

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star configuration. 

Given the definition of a 3-star graph, we know that the center node must be connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's examine each node to see if it acts as a center of a 3-star. 

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<0, (3, 5, 8)>
<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<0, (4, 5, 9)>
<0, (5, 8, 6)>
<0, (5, 8, 9)>
<0, (3, 8, 6)>
<0, (3, 8, 9)>
<5, (6, 8, 9)>
<5, (6, 9, 7)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we get a total of [10].
