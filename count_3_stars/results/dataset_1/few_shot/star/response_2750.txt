Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 4

Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 6, and node 7

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph can be identified based on the definition provided (a central node connected to exactly three other nodes). Here are the steps to find and count the 3-stars:

1. Identify the potential center nodes: Nodes with degree 3 (connected to exactly three other nodes) can potentially serve as the central nodes in a 3-star. In this graph, node 0 and node 3 meet this criterion.

2. For each potential center node, check if it forms a 3-star:
    a. For node 0:
        - Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 8.
        - Among these, only nodes 1, 2, 5 meet the criteria of being connected to exactly three nodes.
        - So, the possible 3-stars with center at node 0 are: <0, (1, 2, 5)>.

    b. For node 3:
        - Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, 5, and 6.
        - Among these, only nodes 0, 4, 5, 6 meet the criteria of being connected to exactly three nodes.
        - So, the possible 3-stars with center at node 3 are: <3, (0, 4, 5)> and <3, (0, 5, 6)>.

3. Count the total unique 3-stars:
    - <0, (1, 2, 5)>
    - <3, (0, 4, 5)>
    - <3, (0, 5, 6)>
  
  So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
