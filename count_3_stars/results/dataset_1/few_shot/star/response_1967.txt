Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the unique 3-stars present in the graph.

Looking at the provided information, let's list down all the 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (4, 8, 9)>
<2, (5, 7, 9)>
<3, (1, 5, 8)>
<5, (2, 3, 8)>
<8, (0, 3, 5)>

Now, by counting the number of unique 3-stars listed above, we get a total of [5] 3-stars in the graph.
