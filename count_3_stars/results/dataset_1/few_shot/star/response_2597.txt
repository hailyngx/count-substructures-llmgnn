Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 6, and node 7

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that can act as the center of a 3-star in the given graph. 
1. Node 1 has 4 neighbors (nodes 5, 6, 7, and 8).
2. Node 3 has 2 neighbors (nodes 0 and 6).
3. Node 6 has 3 neighbors (nodes 1, 3, and 9).
4. Node 7 has 3 neighbors (nodes 1, 4, and 9).

Next, we will count the number of 3-stars in the graph:
1. 3-star with center at node 1: Since node 1 has 4 neighbors, there are 4 potential 3-stars: <1, (5, 6, 7)>, <1, (5, 6, 8)>, <1, (6, 7, 8)>, and <1, (5, 7, 8)>.
2. 3-star with center at node 3: Since node 3 has 2 neighbors, there are 1 potential 3-star: <3, (0, 6, 1)>.
3. 3-star with center at node 6: Since node 6 has 3 neighbors, there are 3 potential 3-stars: <6, (1, 3, 9)>, <6, (1, 7, 9)>, and <6, (3, 7, 9)>.
4. 3-star with center at node 7: Since node 7 has 3 neighbors, there are 3 potential 3-stars: <7, (1, 4, 9)>, <7, (1, 6, 9)>, and <7, (4, 6, 9)>.

In total, there are 11 3-stars in the given graph. 
Therefore, the final answer is [11].
  
The unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<1, (5, 6, 7)>
<1, (5, 6, 8)>
<1, (6, 7, 8)>
<1, (5, 7, 8)>
<3, (0, 6, 1)>
<6, (1, 3, 9)>
<6, (1, 7, 9)>
<6, (3, 7, 9)>
<7, (1, 4, 9)>
<7, (1, 6, 9)>
<7, (4, 6, 9)>
