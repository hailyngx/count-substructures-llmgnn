Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 2) (7, 4) (9, 2) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 4
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars present in the graph. 
Let's list them step-by-step:
1. Identify the central node and the connected nodes for each node:
- Node 0 has a 3-star with leaves 4, 3, and 7: <0, (3, 4, 7)>
- Node 2 has a 3-star with leaves 6, 9, and 4: <2, (4, 6, 9)>
- Node 4 has 3-stars with leaves 0, 3, 7: <4, (0, 3, 7)> and leaves 3, 0, 9: <4, (0, 3, 9)> and leaves 0, 3, 7: <4, (3, 0, 7)> and leaves 0, 3, 9: <4, (3, 0, 9)>
- Node 9 has a 3-star with leaves 2, 4, and 2: <9, (2, 4, 2)>

There are <0, (3, 4, 7)>, <2, (4, 6, 9)>, <4, (0, 3, 7)>, <4, (0, 3, 9)>, <4, (3, 0, 7)>, and <4, (3, 0, 9)> in the given graph. 
Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
