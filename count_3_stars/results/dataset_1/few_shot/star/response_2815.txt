Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern. Let's go through each node and its connections to identify the 3-stars.

For each node:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with (2, 3, 4)
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with (3, 4, 5)
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with (0, 3, 4) and (3, 4, 5)
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with (0, 1, 2)
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with (0, 1, 2) and (7, 8, 9)
- Node 5 does not form a 3-star as it has 2 connections
- Node 6 does not form a 3-star as it has 3 connections but not in a star pattern
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with (4, 8, 9)
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with (4, 7, 9)
- Node 9 does not form a 3-star as it has 2 connections

Count of 3-stars = 5

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
Unique 3-stars: <0, (2, 3, 4)>, <1, (3, 4, 5)>, <2, (0, 3, 4)>, <4, (0, 1, 2)>, <4, (7, 8, 9)>
