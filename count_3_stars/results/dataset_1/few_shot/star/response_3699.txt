Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 6

Response:
The central node in a 3-star must have exactly 3 neighbors. Let's find all the 3-stars in this graph.

The central nodes with exactly 3 neighbors are: 0, 2, 4, 5, 8

Now, let's find the 3-stars for each central node:

For central node 0:
- <0, (3, 5, 6)>
- <0, (3, 5, 6)>

For central node 2:
- <2, (4, 5, 7)>
- <2, (4, 5, 7)>

For central node 4:
- <4, (2, 8, 9)>
- <4, (2, 8, 9)>
  
For central node 5:
- <5, (0, 2, 6)>

For central node 8:
- <8, (1, 4, 6)>

Count of 3-stars: [7]
