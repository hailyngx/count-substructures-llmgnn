Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 1

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a central node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes. 

Looking at the adjacency list for each node:
- Node 0 has 4 connections (not a 3-star)
- Node 1 has 4 connections (not a 3-star)
- Node 2 has 1 connection (not a 3-star)
- Node 3 has 2 connections (not a 3-star)
- Node 4 has 2 connections (not a 3-star)
- Node 5 has 2 connections (not a 3-star)
- Node 6 has 3 connections (potentially a 3-star)
- Node 7 has 3 connections (potentially a 3-star)
- Node 8 has 5 connections (not a 3-star)
- Node 9 has 2 connections (not a 3-star)

Nodes 6 and 7 are the potentials for being the center nodes of 3-stars. Let's check further:

For Node 6:
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 7, and 8.
<6, (0, 7, 8)>

For Node 7:
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 6, and 8.
<7, (2, 6, 8)>

Therefore, there are 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
So, the final count of 3-stars is [2].
