Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 44 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 5, and node 7

Response:
Based on the given information, the 3-stars in the graph are as follows:

<0, (5, 6, 7)>
<0, (5, 7, 9)>
<1, (2, 3, 4)>
<1, (2, 7, 9)>
<3, (1, 6, 9)>
<4, (5, 7, 8)>
<5, (0, 7, 9)>
<7, (0, 1, 9)>
<8, (4, 5, 6)>
<9, (0, 1, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
