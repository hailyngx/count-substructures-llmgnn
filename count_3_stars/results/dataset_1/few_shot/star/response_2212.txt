Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars present. 

From the given information, we can see that the node degrees are as follows:
- Node 0: degree 5
- Node 1: degree 3
- Node 2: degree 1
- Node 3: degree 2
- Node 4: degree 3
- Node 5: degree 1
- Node 6: degree 3
- Node 7: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 2
- Node 9: degree 2

Let's identify the 3-stars:
1. <0, (4, 6, 7)>
2. <0, (4, 7, 9)>
3. <0, (6, 1, 3)>
4. <0, (6, 1, 4)>
5. <4, (0, 9, 6)>
6. <7, (0, 8, 5)>

Therefore, there are [6] unique 3-stars in the graph.
