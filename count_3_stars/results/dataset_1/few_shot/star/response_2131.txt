Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, it's helpful to identify the central node and its neighboring nodes. Since a 3-star consists of a center node and three leaves connected to it, we can analyze each node to see if it acts as the center of a 3-star and count them.

Given the information provided, the central node along with the nodes connected to it are:
- Node 0 (connected to nodes 4 and 7)
- Node 1 (connected to nodes 5 and 6)
- Node 2 (connected to nodes 7 and 8)
- Node 3 (connected to node 5)
- Node 4 (connected to nodes 0, 7, and 8)
- Node 5 (connected to nodes 1, 3, and 9)
- Node 6 (connected to nodes 1 and 9)
- Node 7 (connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, and 9)
- Node 8 (connected to nodes 2, 4, and 9)
- Node 9 (connected to nodes 5, 6, 7, and 8)

Now, we can count the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 7, and 8: <0, (4, 7, 8)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 4, and 9: <7, (0, 4, 9)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 7, and 8: <9, (5, 7, 8)>

Counting the number of 3-stars: [3]
<0, (4, 7, 8)> 
<7, (0, 4, 9)> 
<9, (5, 7, 8)>
