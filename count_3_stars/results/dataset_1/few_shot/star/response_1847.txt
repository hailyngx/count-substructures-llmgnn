Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 5

Response:
Let's first identify all the 3-stars in the given graph based on the definition provided.

Starting from each node, we identify if it is a center of a 3-star by checking if it has exactly three neighbors.

From the adjacency list:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors (not a center)
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors (not a center)
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors (not a center)
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors (potential center)
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors (not a center)
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors (potential center)
- Node 6 has 1 neighbor (not a center)
- Node 7 has 1 neighbor (not a center)
- Node 8 has 1 neighbor (not a center)
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors (not a center)

Potential 3-stars:
- For Node 3: (3, 1, 5, 9)
- For Node 5: (5, 0, 2, 4), (5, 0, 2, 9)

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].

Unique 3-stars:
- <3, (1, 5, 9)>
- <5, (0, 2, 4)>
