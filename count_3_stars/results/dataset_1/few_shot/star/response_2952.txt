Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 5, and node 9
