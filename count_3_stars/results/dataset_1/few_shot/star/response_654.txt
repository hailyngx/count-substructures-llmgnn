Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through each node and find the 3-stars:

1. Node 0: (0, 2, 4, 7), (0, 4, 7, 8) 
2. Node 1: No 3-stars (as it's only connected to one node)
3. Node 2: (2, 0, 3, 4), (2, 3, 4, 7), (2, 4, 7, 9)
4. Node 3: (3, 1, 2, 4), (3, 2, 4, 8) 
5. Node 4: (4, 0, 2, 3), (4, 2, 3, 9)
6. Node 5: No 3-stars (as it's only connected to one node)
7. Node 6: (6, 5, 7, 9)
8. Node 7: (7, 0, 2, 6)
9. Node 8: (8, 0, 3, 5), (8, 3, 5, 9)
10. Node 9: (9, 2, 4, 6), (9, 4, 6, 8)

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 4, 7)>
<0, (4, 7, 8)>
<2, (0, 3, 4)>
<2, (3, 4, 7)>
<2, (4, 7, 9)>
<3, (1, 2, 4)>
<3, (2, 4, 8)>
<4, (0, 2, 3)>
<4, (2, 3, 9)>
<6, (5, 7, 9)>
<7, (0, 2, 6)>
<8, (0, 3, 5)>
<8, (3, 5, 9)>
<9, (2, 4, 6)>
<9, (4, 6, 8)>

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [(15)].
