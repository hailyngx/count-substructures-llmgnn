Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 7, and node 8

Response:
First, identify all the 3-stars in the graph. 

We can see that the following nodes are connected in a star-like fashion:
- Node 0: (0, 4, 5)
- Node 1: (1, 3, 5)
- Node 3: (3, 1, 5), (3, 5, 6), (3, 5, 7)
- Node 4: (4, 0, 5)
- Node 5: (5, 0, 1), (5, 1, 3), (5, 3, 4), (5, 3, 6), (5, 4, 8)
- Node 7: (7, 2, 3), (7, 3, 6), (7, 3, 8), (7, 6, 8), (7, 8, 9)
- Node 8: (8, 4, 5), (8, 5, 7), (8, 7, 9)
- Node 9: (9, 7, 8)

Now, counting the unique 3-stars:
- <0, (4, 5)> 
- <1, (3, 5)> 
- <3, (1, 5)>
- <3, (5, 6)>
- <3, (5, 7)>
- <4, (0, 5)> 
- <5, (0, 1)>
- <5, (1, 3)> 
- <5, (3, 4)> 
- <5, (4, 8)> 
- <7, (2, 3)> 
- <7, (3, 6)> 
- <7, (3, 8)> 
- <7, (6, 8)> 
- <7, (8, 9)> 
- <8, (4, 5)> 
- <8, (5, 7)> 
- <8, (7, 9)> 
- <9, (7, 8)> 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [19].
