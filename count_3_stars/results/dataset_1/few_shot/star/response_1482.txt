Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 3

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Based on the given adjacency list and the definition of a 3-star graph, we can observe the following 3-stars:
<0, (3, 6, 1)>
<1, (4, 6, 7)>
<2, (4, 9, 5)>
<3, (0, 9, 5)>
<4, (1, 2, 5)>
<5, (4, 7, 8)>
<6, (0, 1, 8)>
<7, (1, 5, 8)>
<8, (5, 6, 7)>
<9, (2, 3, 4)>

Count of 3-stars: [10]

Therefore, the final answer is [10].
