Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 4) (8, 4) (8, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are:
<0, (1, 2, 6)>
<2, (0, 3, 4)>
<4, (2, 7, 8)>
<6, (1, 8, 0)>
<8, (4, 6, 0)>
