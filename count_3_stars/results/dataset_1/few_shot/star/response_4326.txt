Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 5, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Each of these instances represents a 3-star in the graph.

Let's identify the 3-stars:

<1, (2, 4, 7)>
<2, (1, 8, 9)>
<7, (1, 3, 5)>
<8, (2, 7, 9)>
<9, (2, 5, 7)>

Therefore, there are a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
