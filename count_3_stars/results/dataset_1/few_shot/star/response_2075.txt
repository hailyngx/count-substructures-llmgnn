Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 6

Response:
There are 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (5, 6, 2)>
<2, (5, 6, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
