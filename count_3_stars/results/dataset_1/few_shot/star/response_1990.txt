Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star pattern.

Upon examining the adjacency list, we can observe the following 3-stars:
<1, (3, 4, 7)>
<3, (1, 5, 7)>
<4, (1, 2, 5)>
<5, (3, 4, 7)>
<7, (1, 2, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
