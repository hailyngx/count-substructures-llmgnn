Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 4

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in this graph is [3].

Unique 3-stars: 
<0, (4, 5, 9)>
<3, (4, 5, 6)>
<4, (0, 3, 6)> [3]
