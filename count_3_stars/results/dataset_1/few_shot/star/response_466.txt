Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the 3-star structures. Since a 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges, we can look for nodes with exactly three edges connected to them.

From the adjacency list provided:
- Node 0 has 3 edges connected (3, 6, 9)
- Node 1 has 2 edges connected (4, 6)
- Node 2 has 2 edges connected (3, 9)
- Node 3 has 4 edges connected (0, 2, 4, 6)
- Node 4 has 3 edges connected (1, 3, 8)
- Node 5 has 1 edge connected (9)
- Node 6 has 4 edges connected (0, 1, 3, 8)
- Node 7 has 0 edges connected
- Node 8 has 2 edges connected (4, 6)
- Node 9 has 3 edges connected (0, 2, 5)

Now, we can construct the 3-stars based on the nodes with exactly three edges connected:
- <0, (3, 6, 9)>
- <2, (3, 9, 0)>
- <5, (9, 0, 2)>
- <9, (0, 2, 5)>

Count of 3-stars in the graph: [4]
Unique 3-stars found: <0, (3, 6, 9)>, <2, (3, 9, 0)>, <5, (9, 0, 2)>, <9, (0, 2, 5)>
