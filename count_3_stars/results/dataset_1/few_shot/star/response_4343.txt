Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 5
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern. 

Given the adjacency list and edge information, we can manually examine each node to find 3-stars. 

Let's list the 3-stars found in the graph: 
<0, (3, 5, 7)>
<1, (3, 5, 6)>
<1, (3, 5, 9)>
<1, (5, 6, 9)>
<5, (0, 1, 9)>

Count of 3-stars in the graph: [5]
