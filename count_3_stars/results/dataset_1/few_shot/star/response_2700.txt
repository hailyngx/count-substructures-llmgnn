Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 6

Response:
Given the graph information, let's find the 3-stars (triangles where one node is connected to exactly three other nodes).

The central nodes in the 3-stars will be the nodes that have exactly 3 neighbors. From the adjacency list:
- Nodes 2, 3, and 5 have only 1 neighbor, so they cannot be central nodes.
- Nodes 1 and 4 have 2 neighbors, so they cannot be central nodes.
- Nodes 0, 6, 7, 8, and 9 have 3 neighbors each.

Let's consider each of these potential central nodes:
- For node 0: (0, 6, 7, 9) forms a 3-star. 
- For node 6: (6, 0, 9, 7) forms a 3-star. 
- For node 7: (7, 0, 1, 9) forms a 3-star. 
- For node 8: (8, 1, 4, 5) does not form a 3-star since 5 is not connected to 8. 
- For node 9: (9, 0, 6, 7) forms a 3-star. 

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are: 
<0, (6, 7, 9)>
<6, (0, 9, 7)>
<7, (0, 1, 9)>
<9, (0, 6, 7)>

Count of 3-stars in the graph: [4]
