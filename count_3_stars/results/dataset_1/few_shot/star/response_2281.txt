Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars step-by-step:

1. Looking at the adjacency list for each node, we can identify the 3-star configurations directly:
   
   - Node 0: <0, (3, 5, 7)>
   - Node 1: <1, (3, 6, 7)>
   - Node 4: <4, (2, 6, 7)>
   - Node 7: <7, (0, 8, 9)>

   These are the unique 3-stars found in the given graph.

2. Count the total number of unique 3-stars found: [4]

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
