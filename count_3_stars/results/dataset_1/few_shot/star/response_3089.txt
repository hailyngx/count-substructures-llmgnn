Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, 7, and node 9

Node 4 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star pattern. Here, we can see that a 3-star can be formed around each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's analyze the graph to find all such patterns.

The nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes are: 0, 1, 2, 6. 
For each of these nodes, we construct a 3-star pattern where the node itself is the center and the other three nodes are its neighbors. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (3, 4, 7)>
<1, (3)>
<2, (5, 9)>
<6, (3)>

Now we count the total number of 3-stars: we found 4 unique 3-stars in the graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
