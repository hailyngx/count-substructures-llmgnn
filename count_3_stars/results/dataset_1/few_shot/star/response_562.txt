Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 5, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

We'll go through each node in the graph and check if it forms a 3-star.  

From the adjacency list, we can see that the possible 3-stars in this graph are:
- Node 0: (1, 3, 6) and (1, 6, 7)
- Node 1: (0, 6, 7) and (0, 3, 8)
- Node 3: (0, 5, 8)
- Node 6: (0, 1, 8)
- Node 8: (1, 3, 9)

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the graph are: <0, (1, 3, 6)>, <0, (1, 6, 7)>, <1, (0, 6, 7)>, <1, (0, 3, 8)>, <3, (0, 5, 8)>, <6, (0, 1, 8)>, and <8, (1, 3, 9)>. 

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
