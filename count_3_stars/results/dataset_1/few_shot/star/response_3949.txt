Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 4, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6, and node 7

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are:
<0, (3, 8, 2)>
<2, (3, 6, 8)>
<3, (0, 5, 7)>
<6, (2, 7, 9)>
<7, (3, 4, 6)>
<7, (4, 6, 9)>
<8, (0, 2, 7)>
<9, (6, 7, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
