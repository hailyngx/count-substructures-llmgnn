Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 3) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 2

Response:
The central node in a 3-star graph is connected to exactly three other nodes. 
Let's find all the 3-stars in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Node 0:
   - Connected to nodes 2, 6, and 7
   - Possible 3-star with node 0 as the center: <0, (2, 6, 7)>

2. Node 1:
   - Connected to nodes 3, 5, and 7
   - Possible 3-star with node 1 as the center: <1, (3, 5, 7)>

3. Node 2:
   - Connected to nodes 0, 4, and 9
   - Possible 3-star with node 2 as the center: <2, (0, 4, 9)>

4. Node 3:
   - Connected to nodes 1 and 8
   - No 3-star centered at node 3 since it is only connected to 2 nodes.

5. Node 4:
   - Connected to nodes 2 and 6
   - No 3-star centered at node 4 since it is only connected to 2 nodes.

6. Node 5:
   - Connected to nodes 1 and 6
   - No 3-star centered at node 5 since it is only connected to 2 nodes.

7. Node 6:
   - Connected to nodes 0, 4, and 5
   - Possible 3-star with node 6 as the center: <6, (0, 4, 5)>

8. Node 7:
   - Connected to nodes 0 and 1
   - No 3-star centered at node 7 since it is only connected to 2 nodes.

9. Node 8:
   - Connected to node 3
   - No 3-star centered at node 8 since it is only connected to 1 node.

10. Node 9:
   - Connected to node 2
   - No 3-star centered at node 9 since it is only connected to 1 node.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (2, 6, 7)>
<1, (3, 5, 7)>
<2, (0, 4, 9)>
<6, (0, 4, 5)>
