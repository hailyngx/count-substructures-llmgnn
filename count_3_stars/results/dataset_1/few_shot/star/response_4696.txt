Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 7
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars where a node is at the center connected to exactly three other nodes.

Looking at the adjacency list and the definition of a 3-star graph, we can observe the following 3-stars:
1. <0, (3, 4, 8)>
2. <1, (3, 5, 6)>
3. <1, (3, 6, 8)>
4. <3, (0, 1, 7)>
5. <4, (0, 2, 5)>
6. <5, (1, 4, 6)>
7. <6, (1, 3, 5)>
8. <8, (0, 1, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
