Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 2

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list all unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<0, (1, 5, 9)>
<0, (1, 6, 8)>
<1, (0, 2, 5)>
<1, (0, 2, 6)>
<2, (1, 6, 7)>
<2, (1, 6, 9)>
<3, (4, 6, 7)>
<3, (4, 7, 8)>
<4, (3, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
