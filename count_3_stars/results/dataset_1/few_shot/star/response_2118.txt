Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible occurrences of a 3-star pattern, where one node is connected to three other nodes. In this case, we are looking for nodes connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's first identify the nodes that satisfy this condition based on the given adjacency list:
- Node 2: Connected to nodes 0 and 1
- Node 4: Connected to node 0
- Node 5: Connected to nodes 0 and 7
- Node 6: Connected to node 1 and 3
- Node 8: Connected to nodes 0, 1, and 7

Now, let's count the 3-stars by considering each of these nodes as the center of a potential 3-star:
1. Node 2: (2, 0, 1), (2, 0, 8), (2, 1, 0), and (2, 1, 8) --> Unique 3-star: <2, (0, 1, 8)>
2. Node 4: (4, 0, 9) and (4, 9, 0) --> Unique 3-star: <4, (0, 9, 0)>
3. Node 5: (5, 0, 9), (5, 0, 7), (5, 7, 0), and (5, 7, 9) --> Unique 3-star: <5, (0, 7, 9)>
4. Node 6: (6, 1, 3) and (6, 3, 1) --> Unique 3-star: <6, (1, 3, 1)>
5. Node 8: (8, 0, 1), (8, 0, 7), (8, 1, 0), and (8, 1, 7) --> Unique 3-star: <8, (0, 1, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5]. 
Unique 3-stars: <2, (0, 1, 8)>, <4, (0, 9, 0)>, <5, (0, 7, 9)>, <6, (1, 3, 1)>, <8, (0, 1, 7)>.
