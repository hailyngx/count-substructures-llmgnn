Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 5, 7, and node 8

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes (forming a 3-star) and count how many such instances exist.

Let's list out all the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<4, (2, 7, 8)>
<4, (7, 8, 9)>
<5, (2, 3, 9)>
<5, (3, 9, 0)>
<8, (7, 4, 9)>
