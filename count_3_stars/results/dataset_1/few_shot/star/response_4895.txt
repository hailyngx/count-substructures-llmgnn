Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 3

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. We can identify these nodes by checking if they are connected to exactly two nodes that are not connected to each other. 

In this graph, we have the following 3-stars:
<1, (2, 4, 8)>
<3, (7, 6, 9)>
<4, (1, 8, 5)>
<6, (7, 8, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
