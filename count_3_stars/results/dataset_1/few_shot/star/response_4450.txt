Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star individually. 

Let's identify the 3-stars step by step:
1. For Node 0: No 3-stars as it is connected to 4, 6, 7, and 8 which do not form a 3-star.
2. For Node 1: No 3-stars as it is connected to 6, 7, and 9 which do not form a 3-star.
3. For Node 2: No 3-stars as it is connected to 4, 5, 6, and 8 which do not form a 3-star.
4. For Node 3: No 3-stars as it is connected to 4, 7, and 9 which do not form a 3-star.
5. For Node 4: <4, (0, 2, 6)> forms a 3-star.
6. For Node 5: No 3-stars as it is connected to 2, 7, and 9 which do not form a 3-star.
7. For Node 6: <6, (0, 4, 1)> forms a 3-star.
8. For Node 7: No 3-stars as it is connected to 0, 1, 3, and 5 which do not form a 3-star.
9. For Node 8: <8, (0, 2, 6)> forms a 3-star.
10. For Node 9: No 3-stars as it is connected to 1, 3, 5, 6, and 8 which do not form a 3-star.

Hence, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<4, (0, 2, 6)>
<6, (0, 4, 1)>
<8, (0, 2, 6)>
