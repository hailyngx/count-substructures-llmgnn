Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 4, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 3

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

Unique 3-stars: 
<5, (0, 3, 9)>
<3, (5, 7, 9)>
<6, (1, 4, 5)>
<4, (5, 6, 7)>
