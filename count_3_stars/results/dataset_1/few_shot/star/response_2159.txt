Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star. 

In this graph, the central node and connected leaf nodes are as follows:
1. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 5
2. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 5, 6
3. Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 4
4. Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 8
5. Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 8, 9
6. Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 7

Therefore, the 3-stars in the given graph are:
<2, (0, 3, 5)>
<2, (0, 5, 6)>
<6, (1, 2, 4)>
<5, (2, 4, 8)>
<5, (2, 8, 9)>
<9, (2, 5, 7)>

Thus, there are a total of [6] 3-stars in the graph.
