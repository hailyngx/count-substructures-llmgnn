Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify sets of 3 nodes that form a 3-star around a central node. Since a 3-star has three leaves connected to a central node, we need to find all combinations of central node and three leaves that form valid 3-stars. 

Based on the given graph and adjacency list, let's identify the 3-stars:

1. <0, (1, 2, 3)>
2. <2, (0, 3, 4)>
3. <3, (0, 2, 8)>
4. <4, (2, 5, 6)>
5. <5, (4, 7, 9)>
6. <6, (4, 5, 9)>
7. <9, (5, 6, -)>

Note: Node 9 only forms a 3-star with nodes 5 and 6, as it does not have another connection to form a complete 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
