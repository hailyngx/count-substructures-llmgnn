Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern. Let's identify the 3-star patterns step by step:

1. Nodes 0, 1, 7 form a 3-star centered at node 0: <0, (1, 7)>
2. Nodes 0, 4, 6 form a 3-star centered at node 0: <0, (4, 6)>
3. Nodes 2, 4, 8 form a 3-star centered at node 2: <2, (4, 8)>
4. Nodes 2, 5, 7 form a 3-star centered at node 2: <2, (5, 7)>
5. Nodes 2, 6, 8 form a 3-star centered at node 2: <2, (6, 8)>
6. Nodes 2, 8, 9 form a 3-star centered at node 2: <2, (8, 9)>
7. Nodes 4, 5, 8 form a 3-star centered at node 4: <4, (5, 8)>
8. Nodes 4, 2, 9 form a 3-star centered at node 4: <4, (2, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
