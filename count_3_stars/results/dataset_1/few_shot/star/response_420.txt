Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 4, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Let's list down the unique 3-stars in the graph by finding all possible combinations where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes:
1. <0, (5, 8)>
2. <1, (2, 8)>
3. <2, (1, 4, 8)>
4. <3, (6, 8)>
5. <4, (2, 6)>
6. <5, (0, 7)>
7. <6, (3, 4, 7), (3, 8, 9), (4, 6, 7), (6, 7, 8)>
8. <7, (5, 6)>
9. <8, (0, 1, 2), (3, 6, 8)>
10. <9, (6)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars listed above, we find that there are [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
