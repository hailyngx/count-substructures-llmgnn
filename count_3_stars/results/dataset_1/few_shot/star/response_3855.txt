Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node and its 3 connected nodes for each 3-star. Let's go step by step:

1. **Identify Nodes Connected to 3 Different Nodes:**
   - Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 3.
   - Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 3.

2. **Identify 3-Stars:**
   - Possible 3-star centered at Node 2: <2, (0, 1, 3)>
   - Possible 3-star centered at Node 6: <6, (1, 2, 3)>

3. **Count the Number of 3-Stars:**
   - We have found 2 unique 3-stars.
