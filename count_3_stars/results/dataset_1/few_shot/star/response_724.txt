Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 5, and node 6

Response:
The given graph has a total of 10 nodes and 24 edges. To count the number of 3-stars, we need to find all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes forming a 3-star pattern with the node as the center. 

By examining the adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars:

<0, (3, 4, 9)>
<2, (4, 9, 7)>
<4, (2, 3, 5)>
<5, (4, 6, 9)>
<6, (5, 9, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5]. 
The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 4, 9)>
<2, (4, 9, 7)>
<4, (2, 3, 5)>
<5, (4, 6, 9)>
<6, (5, 9, 4)>
