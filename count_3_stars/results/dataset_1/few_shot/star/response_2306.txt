Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 7
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 7

Response:
The 3-star graphs can be identified by looking for nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them. 

From the given graph, the nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them are:
- Node 0
- Node 1
- Node 2
- Node 3
- Node 4
- Node 5
- Node 8
- Node 9

Now, let's identify the 3-star structures for each of these nodes:

- For Node 0:
  - <0, (4, 7, 8)>

- For Node 1:
  - <1, (3, 7, -)>

- For Node 2:
  - <2, (4, 7, -)>

- For Node 3:
  - <3, (1, 7, -)>

- For Node 4:
  - <4, (0, 2, 7)>

- For Node 5:
  - <5, (7, -, -)>

- For Node 8:
  - <8, (0, 7, -)>

- For Node 9:
  - <9, (7, -, -)>

As we can see, there are 8 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-star structures in the graph is [8].
