Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 3

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star configuration. 

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (1, 3, 9)>
<0, (2, 4, 9)>
<0, (7, 8, 9)>
<1, (0, 4, 5)>
<3, (0, 1, 9)>
<3, (5, 4, 9)>
<5, (1, 3, 4)>
<5, (6, 7, 8)>
<9, (0, 2, 3)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph: [9].
