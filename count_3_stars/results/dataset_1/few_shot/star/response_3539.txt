Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star by finding all possible combinations of a central node and three connected nodes. 

Let's list the 3-stars in the graph: 
<0, (6, 7, 8)>
<0, (6, 8, 9)>
<0, (7, 8, 9)>
<3, (6, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 3, 9)>
<9, (0, 5, 8)>

Therefore, there are [6] unique 3-stars in the graph.
