Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 6, and node 8

Response:
Given the graph and its adjacency list, let's identify all the 3-stars present. 

Here is the list of unique 3-stars found: 
<0, (1, 3)> 
<1, (0, 6, 9)> 
<2, (4, 5, 6)> 
<3, (0, 5, 8)> 
<6, (1, 2, 9)> 
<8, (3, 7, 9)> 

Count of 3-stars: [6]
