Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we follow these steps:

1. Identify nodes that are part of a 3-star pattern (center node connected to three other nodes).
2. For each identified node, check if it forms a 3-star pattern.
3. Count the total number of unique 3-star patterns found.

Let's go through the steps:

Nodes 0, 2, 5, and 6 have the potential to be the center nodes of 3-star patterns.

1. Node 0:
   - Connected to nodes 2, 5, and 7.
   - Forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 5, and 7. <0, (2, 5, 7)>

2. Node 2:
   - Connected to nodes 0, 4, 5, 6, and 9.
   - Forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 4, and 5. <2, (0, 4, 5)>

3. Node 5:
   - Connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, and 9.
   - Forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, and 2. <5, (0, 1, 2)>

4. Node 6:
   - Connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, and 9.
   - Forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 2, and 4. <6, (1, 2, 4)>

Count of unique 3-stars: [4]

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
