Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node and its three neighbors connected by edges. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we can find the 3-stars as follows:

<3, (0, 4, 6)>
<4, (3, 5, 6)>
<5, (2, 4, 7)>
<6, (3, 4, 8)>
<7, (5, 9)>
<8, (6, 9)>
<9, (7, 8)>

Counting all the unique 3-stars found, we get a total of [7] 3-stars in the graph.
