Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 9
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 6

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique occurrences where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Looking at the adjacency list of each node, we can identify the following 3-star configurations:
<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<1, (7, 8, 9)>
<3, (0, 2, 8)>
<4, (0, 1, 9)>
<6, (7, 8, 9)>
<7, (0, 1, 6)>
<8, (1, 3, 6)>
<9, (1, 3, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
