Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 6

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the 3-stars present. A 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Calculating the number of 3-stars in the graph:
- Start by identifying the nodes that have exactly 3 neighbors. These nodes can potentially be the center of a 3-star.
- For each of these nodes, check if they are indeed the center of a 3-star by examining their neighbors. If the neighbors form a complete 3-star with the center, count it.

Here are the nodes with exactly 3 neighbors:
- Node 0
- Node 2
- Node 3
- Node 8

Analyzing each of these nodes:
1. Node 0: <0, (2, 3, 8)> is a 3-star.
2. Node 2: <2, (0, 3, 6)> is a 3-star.
3. Node 3: <3, (0, 2, 8)> is a 3-star.
4. Node 8: <8, (0, 3, 5)> is a 3-star.

Count of 3-stars: [4]
Unique 3-stars: <<0, (2, 3, 8)>, <2, (0, 3, 6)>, <3, (0, 2, 8)>, <8, (0, 3, 5)>]
