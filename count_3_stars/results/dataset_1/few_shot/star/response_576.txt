Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 6
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
Based on the given information, we can find the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 0 forms a 3-star with (3, 6, 8)
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with (5, 6, 7)
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with (3, 6, 7)
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with (0, 2, 6)
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with (1, 6, 7)
- Node 6 forms three 3-stars: (0, 1, 2), (3, 5, 7), and (6, 7, 8)

Therefore, there are a total of [6] unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

<0, (3, 6, 8)>, <1, (5, 6, 7)>, <2, (3, 6, 7)>, <3, (0, 2, 6)>, <5, (1, 6, 7)>, and <6, (0, 1, 2)>, <6, (3, 5, 7)>, <6, (6, 7, 8)>
