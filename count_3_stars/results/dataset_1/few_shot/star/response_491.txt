Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 5
