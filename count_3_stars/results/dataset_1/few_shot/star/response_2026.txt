Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern.

Looking at the adjacency list for each node, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<1, (3, 4, 6)>
<2, (0, 6, 9)>
<3, (1, 6, 9)>
<4, (0, 6, 9)>
<5, (2, 7, 5)>
<6, (0, 1, 4)>
<7, (5, 8, 6)>
<8, (2, 3, 7)>
<9, (2, 3, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
