Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (2, 9) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, 7, and node 8
