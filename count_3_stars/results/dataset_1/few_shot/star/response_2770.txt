Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 7

Response:
Based on the given information, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:

1. First, identify which nodes in the graph have exactly three neighbors. These nodes can act as the center of a 3-star.
   Looking at the adjacency list, nodes 0, 1, 2, 5, and 8 have exactly three neighbors.

2. For each of these nodes, check their neighbors to see if they form a 3-star configuration.
   
   For Node 0:
   - <0, (2, 5, 6)>
   
   For Node 2:
   - <2, (0, 6, 3)>
   - <2, (0, 6, 8)>
   
   For Node 5:
   - <5, (0, 7, 7)>
   
   For Node 1:
   - No 3-star configuration as it has less than 3 neighbors.
   
   For Node 8:
   - <8, (1, 6, 7)>
   
3. Counting the unique 3-star configurations found:
   [<0, (2, 5, 6)>, <2, (0, 6, 3)>, <2, (0, 6, 8)>, <5, (0, 7, 7)>, <8, (1, 6, 7)>]

Hence, there are [5] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
