Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 9
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that have two edges connecting them to other nodes, along with a third edge connecting them to a unique node. This unique node will be the center of the 3-star. 

First, let's identify the nodes that can act as the center of a 3-star:
- Node 1 has edges to nodes 2 and 6.
- Node 2 has edges to nodes 1 and 9.
- Node 6 has edges to nodes 1 and 9.
- Node 9 has edges to nodes 2, 3, and 6.

Now, we can list the unique 3-stars found:
<1, (2, 6, 9)>
<2, (1, 9, 6)>
<6, (1, 9, 2)>
<9, (2, 3, 1)>
<9, (3, 6, 2)>
<9, (6, 1, 3)>

Count of 3-stars: [6]
