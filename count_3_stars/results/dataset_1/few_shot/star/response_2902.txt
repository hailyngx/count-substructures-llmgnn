Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 4, and node 5

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the possible instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

From the given information, we can see that the node that fits the definition of a 3-star is node 2. Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, and 5. 

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1].

Unique 3-star in the graph: 
<2, (1, 3, 4)>
