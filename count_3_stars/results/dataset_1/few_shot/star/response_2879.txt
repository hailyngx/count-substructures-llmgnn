Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 4

Response:
We will look for 3-stars in the given graph. 

Let's start by listing all the 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (3, 6, 4)>
<2, (3, 4, 8)>
<4, (2, 6, 7)>
<5, (7, 8, 5)>
<6, (0, 4, 7)>
<7, (4, 5, 6)>
<8, (2, 5, 8)>
<9, (1, 3, 4)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars in the graph: [8]
