Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 5

Response:

<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<1, (3, 5, 9)>
<2, (4, 8, 7)>
<3, (0, 1, 7)>
<4, (2, 9, 5)>
<5, (0, 1, 9)>
<6, (0, 7, 6)>
<7, (3, 6, 8)>
