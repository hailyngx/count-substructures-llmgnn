Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will look for each central node and the three nodes connected to it. 

Let's start with the central node 0:
Central Node 0: (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8)
This forms a 3-star <0, (6, 7, 8)>

Moving on to central node 1:
Central Node 1: (1, 4), (1, 6), (1, 8), (1, 9)
This forms two 3-stars <1, (4, 6, 8)> and <1, (6, 8, 9)>

For central node 2:
Central Node 2: (2, 6), (2, 7)
There are no 3-stars centered at node 2.

Central node 3:
Central Node 3: (3, 4), (3, 7)
There are no 3-stars centered at node 3.

Central node 4:
Central Node 4: (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 6), (4, 9)
This forms a 3-star <4, (1, 3, 6)> and <4, (1, 6, 9)>

Central node 5:
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes, so there are no 3-stars centered at node 5.

Central node 6:
Central Node 6: (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 9)
This forms two 3-stars <6, (0, 1, 2)> and <6, (1, 4, 9)>

Central node 7:
Central Node 7: (7, 0), (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 9)
This forms a 3-star <7, (0, 2, 3)> and <7, (0, 2, 9)>

Central node 8:
Central Node 8: (8, 0), (8, 1)
There are no 3-stars centered at node 8.

Central node 9:
Central Node 9: (9, 1), (9, 4), (9, 6), (9, 7)
This forms a 3-star <9, (1, 4, 6)> and <9, (1, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10]. 
The unique 3-stars found are <0, (6, 7, 8)>, <1, (4, 6, 8)>, <1, (6, 8, 9)>, <4, (1, 3, 6)>, <4, (1, 6, 9)>, <6, (0, 1, 2)>, <6, (1, 4, 9)>, <7, (0, 2, 3)>, <7, (0, 2, 9)>, <9, (1, 4, 6)>, and <9, (1, 6, 7)>.
