Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify sets of four nodes where the first node is connected to the other three nodes but the other three nodes are not connected to each other. These sets will represent 3-star structures with the first node as the center.

Looking at the adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-star structures:
<2, (3, 5, 8)>
<5, (1, 2, 8)>
<8, (1, 2, 5)>

After identifying these unique 3-stars, we can count them to find the total number. 
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
