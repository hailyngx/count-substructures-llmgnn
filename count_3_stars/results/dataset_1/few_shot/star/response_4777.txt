Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 8

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes forming a 3-star pattern.

Let's list the 3-stars present in the graph:

<0, (7, 8, 9)>
<2, (4, 5, 3)>
<3, (5, 7, 2)>
<4, (2, 5, 3)>
<5, (2, 3, 4)>
<6, (1, 7, 3)>
<7, (0, 6, 8)>
<8, (0, 9, 7)>
<9, (0, 8, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
