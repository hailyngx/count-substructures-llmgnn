Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6, and node 7

Response:
The central nodes should have exactly three edges to form a 3-star. Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 1 forms a 3-star with leaves 5, 7, and 9. <1, (5, 7, 9)>
2. Node 2 forms a 3-star with leaves 6, 8, and 9. <2, (6, 8, 9)>
3. Node 4 forms a 3-star with leaves 7, and 9. <4, (7, 9)>
4. Node 5 forms a 3-star with leaves 7, and 9. <5, (7, 9)>
5. Node 6 forms a 3-star with leaves 8, and 9. <6, (8, 9)>
6. Node 7 forms a 3-star with leaves 8, and 9. <7, (8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6]. <1, (5, 7, 9)> <2, (6, 8, 9)> <4, (7, 9)> <5, (7, 9)> <6, (8, 9)> <7, (8, 9)>
