Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 7
