Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 3

Response:
First, let's identify the central node and its adjacent nodes for each 3-star. 
- Node 0: (2, 3, 8)
- Node 1: (9)
- Node 2: (0, 7)
- Node 3: (0, 4, 7, 8, 9)
- Node 4: (3, 6)
- Node 6: (4)
- Node 7: (2, 3, 8)
- Node 8: (0, 3, 7)
- Node 9: (1, 3)

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:
- For Node 0: <0, (2, 3, 8)>
- For Node 3: <3, (0, 4, 7, 8)>
- For Node 9: <9, (1, 3)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
