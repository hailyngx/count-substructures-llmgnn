Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, and node 8

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

From the given graph and adjacency list, we can see that there are three potential 3-stars in this graph. Let's list them:

1. <1, (0, 6, 7)>
2. <3, (0, 4, 9)>
3. <9, (2, 3, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
