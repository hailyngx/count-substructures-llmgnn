Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible 3-stars. A 3-star is uniquely defined by its center node and its connected leaves. 

Given the adjacency list, we can quickly identify the 3-stars by looking for central nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's find the 3-stars step-by-step:
1. Node 0 has 4 connections: 1, 4, 5, and 8. It forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 4, and 8. Count: [1]
2. Node 1 has 3 connections: 0, 5, and 8. It forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 5, and 8. Count: [2]
3. Node 2 has 5 connections: 3, 5, 7, 8, and 9. It can potentially form two 3-stars: 
   - <2, (3, 5, 8)>
   - <2, (5, 7, 9)> 
   Count: [4]
4. Node 3 has 3 connections: 2, 4, and 8. It forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 4, and 8. Count: [5]
5. Node 4 has 4 connections: 0, 3, 7, and 8. It forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 3, and 8. Count: [6]
6. Node 5 has 4 connections: 0, 1, 2, and 8. It forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, and 8. Count: [7]
7. Node 6 has 2 connections: 8, and 9. It does not form a 3-star.
8. Node 7 has 4 connections: 2, 4, 8, and 9. It forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 4, and 8. Count: [8]
9. Node 8 has 8 connections: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. It forms four 3-stars:
   - <8, (0, 1, 3)>
   - <8, (0, 4, 5)>
   - <8, (2, 3, 4)>
   - <8, (2, 5, 7)>
   Count: [12]
10. Node 9 has 4 connections: 2, 4, 6, and 7. It forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 4, and 7. Count: [13]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [13].
