Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 8
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern. Since a 3-star consists of a central node connected to three other nodes, we will search for all such configurations.

Upon examining the adjacency list and the given edges, we can identify the following 3-star patterns:

<1, (0, 2, 8)>
<1, (0, 8, 9)>
<1, (2, 8, 9)>
<2, (1, 3, 7)>
<7, (3, 6, 9)>
<7, (6, 8, 9)>
<8, (1, 4, 7)>
<9, (1, 6, 7)>

Counting the unique 3-stars from above, we have found a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph. 

Therefore, the answer is [8].

Final answer: [8]
