Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 7

Response:
The center of a 3-star has a degree of 3, meaning it has 3 adjacent nodes. To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to look for nodes that have exactly 3 neighbors and then check if these neighbors form a 3-star with the center node.

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph.

1. **Node 0:** 0 is connected to 4 and 7. Nodes 4 and 7 are also connected to each other and to additional nodes, so 0 does not form a 3-star.

2. **Node 1:** 1 is connected to 7. Since 1 has only one neighbor, it cannot form a 3-star.

3. **Node 2:** 2 is connected to 6 and 7. Nodes 6 and 7 are also connected to additional nodes, so 2 does not form a 3-star.

4. **Node 3:** 3 is connected to 5. Since 3 has only one neighbor, it cannot form a 3-star.

5. **Node 4:** 4 is connected to 0, 6, and 7. Nodes 0, 6, and 7 are all connected to each other but have additional neighbors, so 4 does not form a 3-star.

6. **Node 5:** 5 is connected to 3, 7, and 8. Nodes 3 and 8 have no other connections to form a 3-star with 5. So, <5, (3, 8, 7)> is a 3-star.

7. **Node 6:** 6 is connected to 2 and 4. Nodes 2 and 4 have additional connections and do not form a 3-star with 6.

8. **Node 7:** 7 is connected to 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, and 9. Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, and 5 all have additional connections and do not form a 3-star with 7.

9. **Node 8:** 8 is connected to 5. Since 8 has only one neighbor, it cannot form a 3-star.

10. **Node 9:** 9 is connected to 7. Since 9 has only one neighbor, it cannot form a 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [].

List of 3-stars: 
<5, (3, 8, 7)>
