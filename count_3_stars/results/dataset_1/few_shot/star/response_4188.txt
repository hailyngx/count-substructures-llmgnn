Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
1. <1, (2, 5, 7)>
2. <1, (2, 7, 8)>
3. <1, (5, 6, 7)>
4. <2, (1, 4, 7)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph: 
[4]
