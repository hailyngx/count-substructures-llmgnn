Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 4, 7, and node 8

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are as follows:
<1, (3, 6, 7)>
<3, (1, 5, 6)>
<5, (2, 3, 4)>
<6, (1, 3, 5)>
<7, (1, 6, 9)>
<9, (1, 4, 7)>
