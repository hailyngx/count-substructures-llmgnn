Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 3) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first identify the central nodes (nodes that have exactly 3 neighbors) and then find the 3-stars centered at those nodes.

The central nodes in this graph are nodes 1, 4, 5, and 6.

Now, let's find the 3-stars centered at each of these central nodes:
1. Node 1: (1, (4, 5, 6))
2. Node 4: (4, (1, 2, 9))
3. Node 5: (5, (1, 2, 9))
4. Node 6: (6, (1, 2))

Count of 3-stars: [4]
Unique 3-stars: <1, (4, 5, 6)> <4, (1, 2, 9)> <5, (1, 2, 9)> <6, (1, 2)>
