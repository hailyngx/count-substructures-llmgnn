Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 6

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].

The unique 3-stars found:
<0, (1, 3, 5)>
