Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node:

Node 4 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 4, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 7

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can identify each unique 3-star configuration. Since a 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes, we need to look for nodes that have exactly three neighboring nodes. 

Let's go through the adjacency list and identify nodes that fit this criterion:

- Node 1 has 3 neighboring nodes: 2, 3, 7
    - <1, (2, 3, 7)>

- Node 3 has 1 neighboring node, which is less than 3.

- Node 5 has 2 neighboring nodes, which is less than 3.

- Node 9 has 3 neighboring nodes: 5, 6, 7
    - <9, (5, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: <1, (2, 3, 7)> and <9, (5, 6, 7)>.
