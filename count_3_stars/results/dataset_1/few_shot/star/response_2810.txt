Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Let's list the unique 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (2, 8, 6)>
<2, (0, 6, 9)>
<6, (2, 8, 4)>
<8, (0, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
