Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 5, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's start by listing the 3-stars present in the graph:

<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<0, (3, 5, 9)>
<0, (3, 6, 9)>
<3, (0, 5, 9)>
<3, (0, 7, 9)>
<3, (5, 7, 9)>
<5, (0, 3, 9)>
<5, (3, 7, 9)>
<5, (0, 6, 9)>
<6, (0, 3, 9)>
<6, (0, 8, 9)>
<6, (8, 9, 5)>
<9, (0, 3, 5)>
<9, (0, 5, 6)>
<9, (0, 3, 7)>

Counting the unique 3-stars listed above, we can see that there are [15] 3-stars in the given graph.
