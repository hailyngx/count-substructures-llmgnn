Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 4, and node 9

Node 4 is connected to node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 8

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph step by step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, and 9. This forms the following 3-stars:
    - <0, (1, 2, 3)>
    - <0, (1, 2, 4)>
    - <0, (1, 2, 9)>
    - <0, (1, 3, 4)>
    - <0, (1, 3, 9)>
    - <0, (1, 4, 9)>
    - <0, (2, 3, 4)>
    - <0, (2, 3, 9)>
    - <0, (2, 4, 9)>
    - <0, (3, 4, 9)>

2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 6, and 7. This forms the following 3-star:
    - <1, (0, 6, 7)>

3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0 and 3. However, there are no 3-stars formed by these connections.

4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0 and 2. Since both connections are already covered in step 1, there are no new 3-stars here.

5. Node 4 is connected to node 0. But this connection is already covered in step 1.

6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 7 and 8. However, there are no 3-stars formed by these connections.

7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 1 and 9. However, there are no 3-stars formed by these connections.

8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 1 and 5. However, there are no 3-stars formed by these connections.

9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 9. However, there are no 3-stars formed by these connections.

10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 6, and 8. This forms the following 3-stars:
    - <9, (0, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15]. 

Here are the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (1, 2, 3)>, <0, (1, 2, 4)>, <0, (1, 2, 9)>, <0, (1, 3, 4)>, <0, (1, 3, 9)>, <0, (1, 4, 9)>, <0, (2, 3, 4)>, <0, (2, 3, 9)>, <0, (2, 4, 9)>, <0, (3, 4, 9)>, <1, (0, 6, 7)>, <9, (0, 6, 8)>
