Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star-like pattern. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we can see that the possible central nodes could be 0, 1, 3, 4, 7, and 8 since they have at least 3 connections. 

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
- For node 0: <0, (1, 3, 4)>, <0, (1, 4, 5)>, <0, (3, 4, 5)>
- For node 1: <1, (0, 5, 5)>
- For node 3: <3, (0, 2, 2)>
- For node 4: <4, (0, 7, 7)>
- For node 7: <7, (4, 6, 8)>

Now, we count the total number of 3-stars which is [5]. 

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
