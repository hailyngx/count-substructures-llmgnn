Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. This forms the structure of a 3-star graph.

Analyzing the given graph:

- Node 0: Not part of any 3-star.
- Node 1: Forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 5, and 6. <1, (3, 5, 6)>
- Node 2: Not part of any 3-star.
- Node 3: Forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 7, and 8. <3, (1, 7, 8)>
- Node 4: Forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 7, and 9. <4, (0, 7, 9)>
- Node 5: Not part of any 3-star.
- Node 6: Not part of any 3-star.
- Node 7: Not part of any 3-star.
- Node 8: Not part of any 3-star.
- Node 9: Not part of any 3-star.

Count of 3-stars in the given graph: [3]
Unique 3-stars: <1, (3, 5, 6)>, <4, (0, 7, 9)>, <3, (1, 7, 8)>
