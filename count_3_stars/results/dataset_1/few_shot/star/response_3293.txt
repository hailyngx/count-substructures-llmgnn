Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

Based on the definition of a 3-star, we need to find nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Looking at the adjacency list:
- Nodes 0 and 3 do not form 3-stars as they are connected to only one other node each.
- Node 4 forms a 3-star: <4, (5, 7)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star: <5, (4, 6, 7)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star: <6, (0, 5, 8)>
- Node 7 does not form a 3-star as it is connected to only two other nodes.
- Node 8 does not form a 3-star as it is connected to only two other nodes.
- Nodes 1, 2, and 9 do not form 3-stars as they are not connected to any other nodes.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3] and the unique 3-stars found are:
<4, (5, 7)>
<5, (4, 6, 7)>
<6, (0, 5, 8)>
