Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star pattern in the graph. 

Let's first identify the central nodes and their corresponding leaves based on the given edges and adjacency list:

1. Central node 0 has leaves 1, 4, and 8
2. Central node 1 has leaves 0, 3, and 7
3. Central node 4 has leaves 0, 2, 5, 6, 8, and 9
4. Central node 5 has leaves 4 and 9

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:

- For central node 0: 
  - <0, (1, 4, 8)>
  
- For central node 1: 
  - <1, (0, 3, 7)>
  
- For central node 4: 
  - <4, (0, 2, 5)>
  - <4, (0, 2, 8)>
  - <4, (0, 5, 9)>
  - <4, (0, 6, 8)>
  - <4, (2, 5, 9)>
  - <4, (2, 6, 8)>
  
- For central node 5: 
  - <5, (4, 9)>
  
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
