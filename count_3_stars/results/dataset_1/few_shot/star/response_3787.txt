Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 3

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star subgraphs in the given graph:

<0, (4, 8, 9)>
<1, (5, 6, 9)>
<2, (3, 4, 5)>
<3, (2, 8, 9)>
<4, (0, 2, 5)>
<5, (1, 2, 4)>
<5, (2, 4, 7)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph.
