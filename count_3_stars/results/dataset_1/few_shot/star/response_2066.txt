Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through each node and find the 3-stars:

1. **Node 0:** Not a part of any 3-star.
   
2. **Node 1:** <1, (0, 3, 4)> is a 3-star.

3. **Node 2:** Not a part of any 3-star.

4. **Node 3:** <3, (1, 2, 5)> is a 3-star.

5. **Node 4:** <4, (1, 7, 9)> is a 3-star.

6. **Node 5:** Not a part of any 3-star.

7. **Node 6:** Not a part of any 3-star.

8. **Node 7:** Not a part of any 3-star.

9. **Node 8:** <8, (3, 5, 9)> is a 3-star.

10. **Node 9:** <9, (2, 4, 6)> and <9, (4, 7, 8)> are 3-stars.

So, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is **5**.

Therefore, the final answer is **[5]**.
