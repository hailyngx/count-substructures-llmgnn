Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 7

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star subgraphs in the given graph. 
A 3-star subgraph consists of a central node connected to three other nodes by edges. 

Starting from each node, we look for its neighbors and check if they form a 3-star. Let's write down the identified 3-stars:

<0, (4, 5)>
<1, (5, 8)>
<2, (4, 8)>
<3, (7, 9)>
<4, (0, 2, 9)>
<5, (0, 1, 6)>
<7, (3, 8, 9)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the given graph.
