Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 8
