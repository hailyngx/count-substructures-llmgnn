Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6)

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph step by step.

Step 1: Identify the 3-stars

From the given adjacency list, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 2, 6: <0, (1, 2, 6)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 2, 9: <1, (0, 2, 9)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, 7: <2, (0, 1, 7)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, 6: <7, (0, 1, 6)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, 6: <9, (0, 1, 6)>

Step 2: Count the number of 3-stars

From Step 1, we found 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].

<List of unique 3-stars: <0, (1, 2, 6)>, <1, (0, 2, 9)>, <2, (0, 1, 7)>, <7, (0, 1, 6)>, <9, (0, 1, 6)>]
