Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are: 
<1, (6, 7, 8)>
<1, (6, 8, 9)>
