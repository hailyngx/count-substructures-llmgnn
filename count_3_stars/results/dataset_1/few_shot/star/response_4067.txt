Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 4, 6, and node 8

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all unique 3-stars where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Given the adjacency list and the edges provided, we can observe the following 3-stars:
<0, (2, 4, 8)>
<1, (6, 7, 8)>
<3, (8, 9, 9)>
<4, (0, 5, 9)>
<5, (4, 8, 8)>
<6, (1, 7, 8)>
<7, (1, 6, 8)>
<8, (0, 3, 5)>
<9, (3, 4, 6)>

Counting these unique 3-stars, we have a total of [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
