Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. In this case, we are looking for nodes that form a 3-star pattern.

Looking at the adjacency list, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:

<1, (2, 3, 4)>
<3, (1, 4, 9)>
<4, (1, 2, 3)>
<6, (3, 5, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4]. 
The unique 3-stars found are <1, (2, 3, 4)>, <3, (1, 4, 9)>, <4, (1, 2, 3)>, and <6, (3, 5, 8)>.
