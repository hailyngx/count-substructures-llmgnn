Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<3, (4, 5, 7)>
<3, (5, 6, 7)>
<3, (5, 7, 9)>
<5, (0, 3, 7)>
<7, (3, 5, 9)>
