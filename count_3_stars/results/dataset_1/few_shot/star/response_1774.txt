Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 7

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

From the adjacency list:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 5, and 6.
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 3, and 7.
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, and 8.
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 6, and 8.
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 6, and 8.
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 4, and 9.
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 8, and 9.

So, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are:
<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<1, (2, 3, 7)>
<2, (1, 3, 8)>
<4, (2, 6, 8)>
<5, (0, 6, 8)>
<6, (0, 4, 9)>
<7, (1, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
