Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 4

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible configurations where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's go node by node to find the 3-stars:
1. For node 0: Possible 3-stars are <0, (1, 2, 4)>, <0, (1, 4, 7)>, <0, (1, 7, 9)>, and <0, (2, 4, 7)>
2. For node 1: Possible 3-stars are <1, (0, 2, 4)>, <1, (0, 4, 7)>, <1, (0, 7, 9)>, and <1, (2, 4, 7)>
3. For node 2: Possible 3-stars are <2, (0, 1, 4)>, <2, (0, 4, 7)>, and <2, (0, 7, 8)>
4. For node 3: No 3-stars as it's only connected to 2 nodes.
5. For node 4: Possible 3-stars are <4, (0, 1, 7)> and <4, (0, 1, 9)>
6. For node 5: No connections to form any 3-stars.
7. For node 6: No connections to form any 3-stars.
8. For node 7: Possible 3-stars are <7, (0, 1, 2)>, <7, (0, 1, 4)>, <7, (0, 1, 8)>, <7, (2, 3, 4)>, and <7, (2, 4, 8)>
9. For node 8: No 3-stars as it's only connected to 2 nodes.
10. For node 9: No 3-stars as it's only connected to 2 nodes.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12]. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 2, 4)>, <0, (1, 4, 7)>, <0, (1, 7, 9)>, <0, (2, 4, 7)>, <1, (0, 2, 4)>, <1, (0, 4, 7)>, <1, (0, 7, 9)>, <1, (2, 4, 7)>, <2, (0, 1, 4)>, <2, (0, 4, 7)>, <2, (0, 7, 8)>, <7, (0, 1, 2)>.
