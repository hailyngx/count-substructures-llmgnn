Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 5

Response:
There are two 3-stars in this graph. 

<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<2, (6, 7, 8)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
