Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 2

Response:
Looking at the graph provided, we can identify the following 3-stars: 

<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<1, (0, 2, 4)>
<2, (1, 8, 9)>
<4, (1, 3, 8)>
<9, (0, 2, -)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
