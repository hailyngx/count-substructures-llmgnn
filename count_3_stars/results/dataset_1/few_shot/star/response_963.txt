Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Here are the steps to find and count the 3-stars:

1. Identify all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
   - Node 0: connected to nodes 3, 8, and 9
   - Node 1: connected to nodes 2, 7, and 8
   - Node 2: connected to nodes 1, 4, and 8
   - Node 3: connected to nodes 0, 7, and 8
   - Node 5: connected to nodes 6, 7, and 8
   - Node 8: connected to nodes 0, 1, and 3
  
2. For each of the identified nodes, check if they form a 3-star by being connected to exactly three other nodes.

Following the steps above, we find the following unique 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (3, 8, 9)>
<1, (2, 7, 8)>
<2, (1, 4, 8)>
<3, (0, 7, 8)>
<8, (0, 1, 3)>

Count of 3-stars: [5]
