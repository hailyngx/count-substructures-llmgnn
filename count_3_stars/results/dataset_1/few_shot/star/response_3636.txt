Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

From the provided adjacency list, we can see that the nodes with exactly three neighbors are: 
- Node 1
- Node 2
- Node 4
- Node 6

Now, let's determine the unique 3-stars in the graph:
- <1, (3, 6, 8)>
- <2, (3, 4, 6)>
- <4, (2, 3, 8)>
- <6, (1, 2, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
