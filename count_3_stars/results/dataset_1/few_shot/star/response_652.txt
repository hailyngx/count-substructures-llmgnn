Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 5, and node 8

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 
We will look for nodes that have exactly 3 neighbors, which is a characteristic of the center of a 3-star.

In this case, the nodes that satisfy this condition are:
- Node 0 with neighbors 3, 4, and none (degree: 2)
- Node 3 with neighbors 0, 2, and 7 (degree: 3)
- Node 4 with neighbors 0 and none (degree: 1)
- Node 5 with neighbors 1, 2, 6, and 9 (degree: 4)
- Node 6 with neighbors 2, 5, and 7 (degree: 3)
- Node 8 with neighbors 1, 2, 7, and 9 (degree: 4)
- Node 9 with neighbors 5 and 8 (degree: 2)

Now let's count the number of unique 3-stars in the graph.

<0, (3, 4)>
<3, (0, 2, 7)>
<5, (1, 2, 6)>
<6, (2, 5, 7)>
<8, (1, 2, 9)>
<2, (1, 3, 5)>
<9, (5, 8)>
