Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8)

Node 6 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can identify each 3-star based on the definition provided. 

In a 3-star, the central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through each node and its connections to see if there are any 3-stars.

Let's start by listing all the possible 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<2, (3, 4, 5)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<4, (1, 2, 6)>
<5, (0, 2, 6)>
<6, (2, 4, 5)>
<7, (0, 4, 8)>
<8, (3, 4, 7)>
<9, (1, 8)>

So, there are 9 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
