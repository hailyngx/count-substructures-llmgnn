Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph and list them, we will first identify the nodes that form 3-stars in the graph. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Nodes forming 3-stars:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 7
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 7
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 4
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 8
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 8, 9
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 9
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 5, 6
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 7

Now, we list the unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 4, 7)>
<1, (0, 3, 7)>
<3, (1, 2, 4)>
<5, (3, 4, 8)>
<6, (2, 8, 9)>
<7, (0, 1, 9)>
<8, (0, 5, 6)>
<9, (2, 5, 7)>

Count of 3-stars: 8
