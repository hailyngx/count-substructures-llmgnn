Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 3

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 0: (1, 5, 8)
2. Node 1: (0, 5, 6)
3. Node 3: (2, 6, 9)
4. Node 5: (0, 1, 6)

So, in total, there are [<0, (1, 5, 8)>, <1, (0, 5, 6)>, <3, (2, 6, 9)>, <5, (0, 1, 6)>].  
Thus, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
