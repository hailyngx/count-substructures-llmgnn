Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the 3-stars present. 

Looking at the graph, we can see that a 3-star is formed when a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. We will list all the unique 3-stars in the graph.

Let's list the unique 3-stars below: 

<0, (2, 6, 4)>
<1, (2, 3, 8)>
<2, (0, 1, 9)>
<3, (1, 4, 9)>
<4, (3, 6, 8)>
<5, (6, 9, 5)>
<6, (0, 4, 5)>
<8, (1, 4, 9)>

Count of 3-stars: [8]
