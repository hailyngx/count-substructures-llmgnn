Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 7

Response:
There are 5 unique 3-star subgraphs in the given graph. 
The 3-star subgraphs are:
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<0, (2, 3, 9)>
<2, (0, 7, 9)>
<3, (0, 4, 6)>
<4, (1, 3, 9)>
