Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 5, and node 8

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 9. Hence, the possible 3-star centered at node 0 is <0, (4, 5, 9)>.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 7, and 8. Hence, the possible 3-star centered at node 1 is <1, (2, 7, 8)>.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 7, and 9. Hence, the possible 3-star centered at node 2 is <2, (1, 7, 9)>.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 5, 7, and 9. Hence, the possible 3-star centered at node 3 is <3, (5, 7, 9)>.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, and 9. Hence, the possible 3-star centered at node 5 is <5, (0, 3, 4)> and <5, (0, 4, 9)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5]. 
The unique 3-stars are: <0, (4, 5, 9)>, <1, (2, 7, 8)>, <2, (1, 7, 9)>, <3, (5, 7, 9)>, <5, (0, 3, 4)>
