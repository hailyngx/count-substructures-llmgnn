Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 7

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are as follows:

<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<0, (1, 7, 9)>
<2, (0, 5, 6)>
<6, (1, 2, 9)>
<7, (0, 1, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
