Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern.

Looking at the adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars:

<0, (3, 8, 9)>
<1, (3, 5, 6)>
<2, (4, 6, 7)>
<4, (2, 8, 9)>
<5, (1, 6, 9)>
<7, (1, 2, 3)>
<8, (0, 4, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7]. 

Unique 3-stars found:
<0, (3, 8, 9)>
<1, (3, 5, 6)>
<2, (4, 6, 7)>
<4, (2, 8, 9)>
<5, (1, 6, 9)>
<7, (1, 2, 3)>
<8, (0, 4, 9)>
