Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, creating a 3-star pattern.

Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:
<0, (3, 4, 9)>
<2, (5, 9, 3)>
<3, (0, 5, 9)>
<9, (0, 2, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
