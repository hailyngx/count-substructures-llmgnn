Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8)

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars present in the graph.

Looking at the definition of a 3-star graph, we see that it consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Therefore, in this graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 8: <0, (1, 5, 8)>
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4: <1, (0, 2, 4)>
3. Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 5: <4, (1, 2, 5)>
4. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 7: <5, (0, 4, 7)>
5. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 6, 9: <8, (0, 6, 9)>
6. Node 9 is connected to nodes 7, 8, 2: <9, (7, 8, 2)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5] when counting unique 3-stars only once.
