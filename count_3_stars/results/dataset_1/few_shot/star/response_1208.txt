Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 4

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

First, let's identify the nodes with degree 3, as those are potential centers of 3-stars:
- Node 0, Node 6, and Node 8 have a degree of 4 (they are connected to 4 other nodes each).
- Node 1, Node 3, and Node 4 have a degree of 3 (they are connected to 3 other nodes each).
- Node 2, Node 5, and Node 7 have a degree of 2 (they are not suitable to be centers of 3-stars).

Next, let's consider the potential 3-star configurations with nodes of degree 3:
1. Node 1 as the center:
   - (1, 0, 8), (1, 3, 2), (1, 8, 6)
2. Node 3 as the center:
   - (3, 1, 0), (3, 2, 6), (3, 9, 4)
3. Node 4 as the center:
   - (4, 0, 7), (4, 9, 3)

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is 8.
[8]

Unique 3-stars found:
<1, (0, 8, 6)>
<1, (3, 2, 6)>
<3, (1, 0, 8)>
<3, (9, 4, 0)>
<4, (0, 7, 9)>
