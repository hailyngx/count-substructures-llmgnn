Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 6

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star in the graph. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we can see that nodes with exactly three neighbors are potential center nodes of 3-stars. These nodes are 1, 3, 8, and 9. Let's further investigate:

1. Node 1 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 8, and 9: This gives us the 3-stars with center node 1: <1, (4, 5, 8)> and <1, (4, 5, 9)>. (Note: We don't count duplicates like <1, (4, 5, 8)> twice.)

2. Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 8: This gives us the 3-star with center node 3: <3, (2, 5, 8)>.

3. Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 5: This gives us the 3-star with center node 8: <8, (1, 3, 5)>.

4. Node 9 is connected to nodes 1 and 6: However, since node 9 doesn't have exactly three neighbors, it cannot be the center of a 3-star.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: 
<1, (4, 5, 8)>
<1, (4, 5, 9)>
<3, (2, 5, 8)>
