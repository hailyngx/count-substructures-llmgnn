Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 1

Response:
First, identify the 3-stars in the given graph based on the definition provided. Each 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

The 3-stars in the given graph are:
<0, (1, 5, 9)>
<1, (0, 5, 9)>
<1, (6, 7, 9)>
<1, (5, 6, 7)>
<3, (0, 8, -)>
<4, (2, 8, -)>
<5, (0, 1, -)>
<6, (1, 7, -)>
<7, (1, 6, 8)>
<8, (3, 4, 7)>
<9, (0, 1, -)>

Now, count the total number of unique 3-stars found in the graph: 
[10]
