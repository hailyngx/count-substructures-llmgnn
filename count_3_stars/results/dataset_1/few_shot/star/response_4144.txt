Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the central nodes and their respective leaves. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we can determine the central nodes and their corresponding leaves:
- Node 0 has leaves 3, 4, 5, 8, 9
- Node 1 has leaves 3, 4, 7, 9
- Node 3 has leaves 0, 1, 2, 6
- Node 4 has leaves 0, 1, 7
- Node 7 has leaves 1, 4, 8, 9
- Node 9 has leaves 0, 1, 5, 7

Based on the information above, we can find the unique 3-star configurations in the graph:
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<0, (3, 4, 8)>
<0, (3, 4, 9)>
<1, (3, 4, 7)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<3, (0, 1, 6)>
<4, (0, 1, 7)>
<7, (1, 4, 8)>
<7, (1, 4, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
