Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the 3-stars. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Since the graph has 10 nodes, we will examine each node to see if it is the central node of a 3-star. 

Starting with Node 0:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 5. This does not form a 3-star.

Moving on to Node 1:

- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, 7, and 8. 
  - <1, (0, 4, 5)>
  - <1, (2, 3, 8)>
  - <1, (4, 7, 8)>

Checking Node 2:

- Node 2 is connected to node 1. This does not form a 3-star.

Checking Node 3:

- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 6, and 9. 
  - <3, (1, 4, 6)>
  - <3, (4, 6, 9)>

Checking Node 4:

- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, 5, and 8. 
  - <4, (0, 5, 1)>
  - <4, (1, 3, 8)>
  - <4, (3, 5, 0)>
  - <4, (5, 8, 0)>

Checking Node 5:

- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0 and 4. This does not form a 3-star.

Checking Node 6:

- Node 6 is connected to nodes 3 and 9. This does not form a 3-star.

Checking Node 7:

- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1 and 8. This does not form a 3-star.

Checking Node 8:

- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 7. 
  - <8, (1, 4, 7)>
  - <8, (4, 7, 1)>

Checking Node 9:

- Node 9 is connected to nodes 3 and 6. This does not form a 3-star.

Therefore, the number of unique 3-stars in the given graph is [10]. 
The 3-stars found are: 
<1, (0, 4, 5)>, <1, (2, 3, 8)>, <1, (4, 7, 8)>, <3, (1, 4, 6)>, <3, (4, 6, 9)>, <4, (0, 5, 1)>, <4, (1, 3, 8)>, <4, (3, 5, 0)>, <4, (5, 8, 0)>, <8, (1, 4, 7)>, <8, (4, 7, 1)>.
