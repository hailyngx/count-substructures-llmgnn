Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will first identify all the 3-stars and then count them.

Here are the steps we will follow:
1. Identify all the 3-stars in the graph.
2. Count the total number of unique 3-stars found in the graph.

Let's start by identifying the 3-stars in the graph.
