Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly 3 other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern. In this case, we can identify the following unique 3-stars:

<0, (4, 8, 9)>
<1, (2, 7, 9)>
<4, (0, 5, 8)>
<7, (1, 5, 8)>

Since each 3-star is mentioned only once, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
