Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 8

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star configurations in the given graph:

- Node 0: (5, 6, 9) -> <0, (5, 6, 9)>
- Node 1: (3, 4, 6) -> <1, (3, 4, 6)>
- Node 2: (3, 6, 9) -> <2, (3, 6, 9)>
- Node 3: (1, 2, 8) -> <3, (1, 2, 8)>
- Node 4: (1, 5, 8) -> <4, (1, 5, 8)>
- Node 5: (0, 4, 8) and (0, 8, 9) -> <5, (0, 4, 8)>
- Node 6: (0, 1, 2) -> <6, (0, 1, 2)>
- Node 8: (1, 3, 4), (1, 5, 8), and (1, 8, 9) -> <8, (1, 3, 4)>

There are a total of 8 unique 3-stars in this graph. So, the number of 3-stars in this graph is [8].
