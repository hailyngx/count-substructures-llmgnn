Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star and then count them. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<1, (2, 4, 5)>
<2, (1, 7, 9)>
<3, (1, 4, 7)>
<4, (2, 3, 7)>
<5, (0, 1, 7)>
<7, (1, 2, 5)>
<9, (2, 7, -)>

The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
