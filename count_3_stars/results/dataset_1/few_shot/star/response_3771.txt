Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (5, 6, 1)>
<1, (2, 9, 5)>
<4, (5, 9, 8)>
<9, (1, 7, 4)>

Therefore, there are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.
