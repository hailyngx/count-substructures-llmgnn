Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star-like pattern. Let's go step by step to find all the 3-stars:

1. Nodes 0, 2, and 4 form a 3-star <0, (2, 4)>
2. Nodes 0, 2, and 5 form a 3-star <0, (2, 5)>
3. Nodes 0, 6, and 3 form a 3-star <0, (6, 3)>
4. Nodes 0, 7, and 3 form a 3-star <0, (7, 3)>
5. Nodes 0, 8, and 2 form a 3-star <0, (8, 2)>
6. Nodes 2, 1, and 4 form a 3-star <2, (1, 4)>
7. Nodes 2, 8, and 5 form a 3-star <2, (8, 5)>
8. Nodes 4, 3, and 5 form a 3-star <4, (3, 5)>
9. Nodes 3, 6, and 7 form a 3-star <3, (6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
<0, (2, 4)>
<0, (2, 5)>
<0, (6, 3)>
<0, (7, 3)>
<0, (8, 2)>
<2, (1, 4)>
<2, (8, 5)>
<4, (3, 5)>
<3, (6, 7)>
