Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 8

Response:
The unique 3-stars in the given graph are:
<0, (1, 6, 6)>
<1, (0, 5, 6)>
<2, (3, 5, 9)>
<3, (2, 6, 6)>
<4, (8, 8, 9)>
<5, (1, 2, 6)>
<6, (0, 1, 3)>
<8, (4, 6, 9)>
<9, (2, 6, 8)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
