Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 4

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph can be identified by finding nodes that have exactly 3 neighbors, which form a star pattern with the node as the center. Let's identify the 3-stars:

<0, (2, 4, 7)>
<1, (2, 4, 9)>
<2, (0, 1, 5)>
<4, (0, 1, 9)>

After identifying the unique 3-stars, we can count the total number of 3-stars in the graph:

[4]
