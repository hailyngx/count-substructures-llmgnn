Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible 3-stars.

Starting with the definition of a 3-star where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes, we look for such configurations in the graph:

1. The center node could be any node from 0 to 9.
2. For each center node, we check if it is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's go through each node to identify the 3-stars:

Node 0:
- Node 0 is not a center of any 3-star since it is connected to only one other node.

Node 1:
- Node 1 is not a center of any 3-star since it is connected to two other nodes.

Node 2:
- Node 2 is not a center of any 3-star since it is connected to two other nodes.

Node 3:
- Node 3 is not a center of any 3-star since it is connected to two other nodes.

Node 4:
- Node 4 is the center of a 3-star <4, (0, 1, 2)>.

Node 5:
- Node 5 is the center of a 3-star <5, (4, 7, 8)>.

Node 6:
- Node 6 is not a center of any 3-star since it is connected to two other nodes.

Node 7:
- Node 7 is the center of a 3-star <7, (3, 4, 5)>.

Node 8:
- Node 8 is the center of a 3-star <8, (1, 3, 5)>.

Node 9:
- Node 9 is not a center of any 3-star since it is connected to two other nodes.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [3]. 

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<4, (0, 1, 2)>, 
<5, (4, 7, 8)>, 
<7, (3, 4, 5)>.
