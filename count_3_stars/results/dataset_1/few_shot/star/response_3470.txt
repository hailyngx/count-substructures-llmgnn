Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (2, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 5
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible instances where a node forms a 3-star with exactly three other nodes.

Let's go node by node to find all 3-stars:

1. Node 0: <0, (1, 6, 5)>
2. Node 1: No 3-stars as it is only connected to node 0.
3. Node 2: No 3-stars as it is only connected to node 4.
4. Node 3: No 3-stars as it is only connected to node 7.
5. Node 4: <4, (2, 7, 0)>
6. Node 5: No 3-stars as it is only connected to nodes 6 and 8.
7. Node 6: <6, (0, 5, 7)>
8. Node 7: No 3-stars as it is only connected to nodes 3, 4, and 6.
9. Node 8: No 3-stars as it is only connected to node 5.
10. Node 9: No connections, so no 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: <<0, (1, 6, 5)>, <4, (2, 7, 0)>, <6, (0, 5, 7)>>.
