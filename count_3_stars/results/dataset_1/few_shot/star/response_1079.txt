Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of nodes where one node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Based on the adjacency list provided and the definition of a 3-star, we can identify the following 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<1, (0, 6, 7)>
<3, (2, 5, 7)>
<3, (5, 8, 9)>
<4, (6, 8, 9)>
<9, (3, 8, 4)>

There are [6] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
