Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 7

Response:
Starting with Node 0:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 4 and 8. 
    - Thus, there is one 3-star centered at Node 0: <0, (4, 8)>
Next, Node 1:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2 and 5.
    - Thus, there are no 3-stars centered at Node 1.
Moving on to Node 2:
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1 and 5.
    - Thus, there are no 3-stars centered at Node 2.
Proceeding to Node 3:
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 5, 8, and 9. 
    - Thus, there is one 3-star centered at Node 3: <3, (5, 8, 9)>
Moving to Node 4:
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 7, and 9.
    - Thus, there is one 3-star centered at Node 4: <4, (0, 7, 9)>
Next, Node 5:
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, and 7.
    - Thus, there is one 3-star centered at Node 5: <5, (1, 2, 7)>
Moving to Node 6:
- Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Thus, there are no 3-stars centered at Node 6.
Moving on to Node 7:
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 9.
    - Thus, there is one 3-star centered at Node 7: <7, (4, 5, 9)>
Next, Node 8:
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0 and 3.
    - Thus, there are no 3-stars centered at Node 8.
Finally, Node 9:
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 7.
    - Thus, there is one 3-star centered at Node 9: <9, (3, 4, 7)>
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
