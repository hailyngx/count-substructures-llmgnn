Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify the central node and its three connected nodes for each 3-star.

Given the graph with 10 nodes and 18 edges, the <central node, (leaves)> for each 3-star is as follows:
<0, (4, 6)>
<1, (6, 9)>
<6, (0, 1, 7)>
<2, (3, 4)>
<9, (1, 5)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we get a total of [5].
