Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 7

Response:
The given graph has one 3-star, which is:

<0, (1, 4, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1].
