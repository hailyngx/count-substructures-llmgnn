Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 4

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

From the adjacency list, we can see that the nodes with 3 connections are:
- Node 0 (connected to 4, 7, 8)
- Node 4 (connected to 0, 2, 8)
- Node 8 (connected to 0, 3, 4)
- Node 9 (connected to 0, 1, 3)

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0: (0, 4, 7, 8) is a 3-star. (3-stars count: 1)
- Node 4: (4, 0, 2, 8) is a 3-star. (3-stars count: 2)
- Node 8: (8, 0, 3, 4) is a 3-star. (3-stars count: 3)
- Node 9: (9, 0, 1, 3) is a 3-star. (3-stars count: 4)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (4, 7, 8)>
<4, (0, 2, 8)>
<8, (0, 3, 4)>
<9, (0, 1, 3)>
