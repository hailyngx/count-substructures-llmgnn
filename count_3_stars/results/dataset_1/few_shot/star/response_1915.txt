Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars (triangles) in the given graph, we can look for each possible 3-star centered at each node. A 3-star is formed when the center node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's go through each node and identify the 3-stars:

- For node 0: No 3-star as it is only connected to one node.
- For node 1: No 3-star as it is connected to two nodes.
- For node 2: No 3-star as it is connected to four nodes.
- For node 3: No 3-star as it is connected to two nodes.
- For node 4: <4, (1, 2, 0)>
- For node 5: <5, (2, 6, 9)>
- For node 6: No 3-star as it is connected to three nodes, but they do not form a 3-star configuration.
- For node 7: No 3-star as it is connected to three nodes, but they do not form a 3-star configuration.
- For node 8: No 3-star as it is only connected to one node.
- For node 9: <9, (1, 3, 5)>, <9, (1, 3, 7)>, <9, (1, 5, 6)>, <9, (1, 7, 5)>, <9, (3, 5, 6)>, <9, (3, 5, 7)>, <9, (3, 6, 5)>, <9, (3, 7, 5)>, <9, (5, 6, 1)>, <9, (5, 6, 3)>, <9, (5, 6, 9)>, <9, (5, 7, 1)>, <9, (5, 7, 3)>, <9, (5, 9, 6)>, <9, (6, 1, 5)>, <9, (6, 3, 5)>, <9, (6, 5, 9)>, <9, (6, 9, 0)>, <9, (6, 9, 5)>, <9, (7, 1, 5)>, <9, (7, 3, 5)>, <9, (7, 5, 6)>, <9, (9, 1, 6)>, <9, (9, 3, 5)>, <9, (9, 5, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2]. 
<4, (1, 2, 0)>, <5, (2, 6, 9)>
