Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars present. 
Let's list all the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (1, 4, 7)>
<1, (0, 3, 7)>
<2, (4, 5, 7)>
<3, (1, 7, 9)>
<4, (0, 2, 7)>
<5, (2, 7, 4)>
<7, (0, 3, 4)>
<9, (3, 8, 7)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the given graph inside brackets [].
