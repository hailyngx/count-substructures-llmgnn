Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 4, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern. Here are the 3-stars present in the given graph:

[4]
<0, (1, 3, 7)>
<1, (0, 3, 9)>
<3, (0, 1, 9)>
<6, (0, 7, 9)>
<7, (0, 1, 9)>
<9, (1, 3, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
