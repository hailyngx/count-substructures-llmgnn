Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 8

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph.

1. From the adjacency list, we can see that Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 4, and 6. So, one 3-star is <0, (1, 4, 6)>.

2. Similarly, we have another 3-star at Node 2 with nodes 3, 6, and 7. So, another 3-star is <2, (3, 6, 7)>.

3. Lastly, Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 5 and 9. So, the final 3-star is <8, (5, 9)>.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
