Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a 3-star pattern.

Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<0, (1, 7, 8)>
<1, (0, 3, 6)>
<1, (0, 6, 9)>
<2, (0, 5, 6)>
<2, (0, 6, 7)>
<4, (0, 9, 5)>
<5, (0, 2, 6)>
<5, (0, 6, 9)>
<6, (1, 2, 7)>
<6, (1, 7, 8)>
<9, (1, 4, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [13].
