Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 10 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 7) (2, 8) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 7

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.
First, let's list the unique 3-stars present in the graph:

<2, (7, 8, 9)>
<4, (5, 7, 2)>
<5, (4, 7, 2)>
<7, (2, 5, 9)>
<8, (2, 7, 5)>
<9, (7, 2, 5)>

Now, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
