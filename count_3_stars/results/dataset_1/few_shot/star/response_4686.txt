Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 9
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all possible 3-stars by checking each node's connections. 

Let's list the 3-stars in the graph: 
<0, (1, 4, 9)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<3, (1, 2, 4)>
<3, (1, 4, 6)>
<3, (1, 4, 7)>
<3, (1, 4, 9)>
<3, (2, 4, 6)>
<3, (2, 4, 7)>
<3, (4, 6, 7)>
<3, (4, 6, 9)>
<3, (4, 7, 9)>
<4, (0, 1, 3)>
<4, (0, 3, 9)>
<4, (1, 3, 9)>
<6, (3, 4, 7)>
<9, (0, 3, 4)>

Count of 3-stars: [15]
