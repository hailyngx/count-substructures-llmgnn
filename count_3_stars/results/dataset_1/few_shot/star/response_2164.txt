Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:

[<0, (5, 6, 7)>, <4, (3, 5, 6)>] 

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
