Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 6

Response:
Based on the given graph information, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<2, (3, 6, 8)>
<3, (2, 4, 6)>
<6, (0, 2, 8)>
<6, (2, 3, 9)>
