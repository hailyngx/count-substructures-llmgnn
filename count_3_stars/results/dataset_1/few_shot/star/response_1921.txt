Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 6, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we'll look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. Based on the adjacency list provided, the nodes that fit this criteria are:
- Node 0: connected to nodes 1, 6, and 7
- Node 1: connected to nodes 0, 6, and 9
- Node 6: connected to nodes 0, 1, and 7
- Node 7: connected to nodes 0, 6, and 9
- Node 9: connected to nodes 0, 1, and 8

By identifying the valid 3-stars, we can count them and provide the final answer.
Here is the list of unique 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<1, (0, 6, 9)>
<6, (0, 1, 7)>
<7, (0, 6, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 8)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
