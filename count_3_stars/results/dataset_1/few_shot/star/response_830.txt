Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 8

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes with exactly three neighbors. These are nodes with a degree of 3 in the graph. 
From the adjacency list, the nodes with a degree of 3 are nodes 0, 3, and 8. 

Next, we will list all 3-stars that can be formed in the given graph: 

<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<3, (0, 2, 8)>
<8, (1, 3, 4)>
<8, (3, 4, 6)>
<8, (3, 6, 7)>
<8, (4, 6, 7)>
<8, (6, 7, 9)>
<8, (7, 6, 9)>
<8, (6, 9, 4)>
<8, (7, 9, 4)>
<8, (9, 6, 4)>
<8, (9, 4, 3)>

Finally, counting the number of unique 3-stars, we get: [12].
