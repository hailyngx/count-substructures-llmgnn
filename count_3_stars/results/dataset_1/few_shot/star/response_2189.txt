Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's analyze the graph:

The nodes and their connections can be represented as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 6
- Node 1 is connected to node 4
- Node 2 is connected to node 9
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 6
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, and 7
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0 and 3
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 7
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 8
- Node 8 is connected to node 7
- Node 9 is connected to node 2

Observations/3-stars found:
1. Node 0 forms a 3-star: <0, (4, 5, 6)>
2. Node 3 forms a 3-star: <3, (4, 5, 6)>
3. Node 4 forms a 3-star: <4, (0, 1, 3)>
4. Node 6 forms a 3-star: <6, (0, 3, 7)>

Total number of 3-stars: [4]
