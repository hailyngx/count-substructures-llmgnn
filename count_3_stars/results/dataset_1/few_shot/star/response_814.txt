Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a central node (center) is connected to exactly three other nodes (leaves). Let's find these 3-stars step-by-step:

1. Counting 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: <0, (2, 4, 5)>, <0, (2, 4, 6)>, <0, (2, 5, 6)>, <0, (4, 5, 6)>
- Node 1: No 3-stars (as it is only connected to 2 other nodes)
- Node 2: <2, (0, 3, 6)>, <2, (0, 4, 6)>, <2, (3, 4, 6)>
- Node 3: No 3-stars
- Node 4: <4, (0, 6, 8)>, <4, (1, 7, 8)>, <4, (6, 7, 8)>
- Node 5: <5, (0, 6, 7)>
- Node 6: <6, (0, 4, 8)>, <6, (2, 4, 8)>, <6, (4, 7, 8)>
- Node 7: <7, (1, 4, 8)>, <7, (5, 6, 8)>
- Node 8: No 3-stars
- Node 9: No 3-stars

2. Counting total 3-stars:
Adding the unique 3-stars found above: <0, (2, 4, 5)>, <0, (2, 4, 6)>, <0, (2, 5, 6)>, <0, (4, 5, 6)>, <2, (0, 3, 6)>, <2, (0, 4, 6)>, <2, (3, 4, 6)>, <4, (0, 6, 8)>, <4, (1, 7, 8)>, <4, (6, 7, 8)>, <5, (0, 6, 7)>, <6, (0, 4, 8)>, <6, (2, 4, 8)>, <6, (4, 7, 8)>, <7, (1, 4, 8)>, <7, (5, 6, 8)>
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [16].
  
[<0, (2, 4, 5)>, <0, (2, 4, 6)>, <0, (2, 5, 6)>, <0, (4, 5, 6)>, <2, (0, 3, 6)>, <2, (0, 4, 6)>, <2, (3, 4, 6)>, <4, (0, 6, 8)>, <4, (1, 7, 8)>, <4, (6, 7, 8)>, <5, (0, 6, 7)>, <6, (0, 4, 8)>, <6, (2, 4, 8)>, <6, (4, 7, 8)>, <7, (1, 4, 8)>, <7, (5, 6, 8)>]
