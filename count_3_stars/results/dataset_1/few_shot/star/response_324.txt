Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 3

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the graph. 

From the adjacency list, we can see that the central nodes (with exactly 3 connecting edges) are nodes 0, 3, 6, and 9. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (2, 4, 7)>
<0, (2, 7, 9)>
<0, (3, 4, 9)>
<3, (0, 5, 9)>
<3, (5, 6, 9)>
<6, (2, 5, 8)>
<6, (5, 7, 8)>

Counting the number of unique 3-star configurations, we have a total of [7].
