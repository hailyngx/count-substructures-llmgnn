Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 3) (7, 2) (7, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 3
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 3

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are:
<0, (1, 2, 9)>
<2, (0, 3, 7)>
<3, (1, 2, 5)>
<7, (2, 4, 7)>
<9, (0, 3, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
