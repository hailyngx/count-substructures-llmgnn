Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 7

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are as follows:
<[0, (1, 4, 5)]>
<[1, (0, 5, 8)]>
<[4, (0, 7, 8)]>
<[5, (0, 1, 2)]>
<[7, (1, 4, 9)]>
<[8, (1, 4, -)]>
<[9, (3, 4, 7)]>
[7]
