Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 5, and node 6

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star structures in the given graph. Remember that a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

We find the following 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<1, (0, 2, 5)>
<2, (1, 3, 4)>
<3, (2, 5, 9)>
<4, (0, 1, 2)>
<5, (1, 3, 9)>
<6, (0, 7, 8)>
<9, (1, 4, 6)>

Count of 3-stars: [8]
