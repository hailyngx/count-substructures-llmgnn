Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern. 

The nodes and their connections that form 3-stars are as follows:
<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<1, (0, 2, 6)>
<2, (0, 1, 5)>
<3, (1, 6, 7)>
<6, (0, 1, 5)>
<7, (3, 6, 9)>
<9, (2, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7]. 

<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<1, (0, 2, 6)>
<2, (0, 1, 5)>
<3, (1, 6, 7)>
<6, (0, 1, 5)>
<7, (3, 6, 9)>
<9, (2, 7, 9)>
