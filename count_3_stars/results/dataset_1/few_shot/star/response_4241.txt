Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 8
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star in the graph. Let's start by identifying the 3-stars one by one:

1. Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 6, and 9: <0, (4, 6, 9)>
2. Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 5, and 8: <4, (0, 5, 8)>
3. Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 5, and 9: <8, (1, 5, 9)>
4. Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 7, and 8: <9, (0, 7, 8)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the given graph:
[4]
