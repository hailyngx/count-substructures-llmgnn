Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 5) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all the unique instances where a node is the center of a 3-star. 

Based on the provided information, the 3-stars in this graph are:
- <2, (0, 5, 9)>
- <3, (1, 4, 6)>
- <5, (2, 7, 8)>
- <9, (2, 4, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
