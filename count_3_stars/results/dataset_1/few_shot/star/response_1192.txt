Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find each unique combination of a central node and its three connected nodes. Let's go through the process step by step:

1. Identify the central node and its connected nodes:
- From the adjacency list, we can see which nodes are connected to each node. 
- Based on the definition of a 3-star graph, the central node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

2. List the unique 3-stars:
- Using the information provided, we can find the unique 3-stars in the graph.
- We will list each unique 3-star in the format <central node, (connected nodes...)>

3. Count the number of 3-stars:
- Finally, we will count the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph.

Let's start by identifying the unique 3-stars:
