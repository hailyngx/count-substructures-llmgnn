Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the 3-stars by finding central nodes connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<2, (3, 5, 8)>
<7, (1, 6, 8)>
<7, (6, 8, 9)>
<8, (2, 3, 9)>

Count of 3-stars: [5]
