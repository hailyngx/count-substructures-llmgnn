Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 6
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 1

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to look for each possible configuration where a node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern.

Given the graph information, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<1, (0, 4, 9)>
<2, (4, 6, 7)>
<2, (4, 6, 8)>
<2, (6, 3, 8)>
<4, (1, 2, 3)>
<4, (1, 3, 6)>
<8, (2, 3, 4)>

Therefore, there are a total of [7] 3-stars in the graph.
