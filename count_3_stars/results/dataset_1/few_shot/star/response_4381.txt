Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 4, 7, and node 8

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify every valid 3-star, which consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Based on the provided information, we can see that the central node should have exactly 3 adjacent nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars:

1. <0, (2, 4, 6)>
2. <2, (0, 6, 7)>
3. <3, (5, 6, 7)>
4. <4, (0, 6, 7)>
5. <6, (0, 2, 4)>
6. <7, (2, 4, 6)>
7. <9, (2, 4, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
