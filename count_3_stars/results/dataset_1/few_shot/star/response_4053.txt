Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 8

Response:
The central nodes for a 3-star graph in this case can be any of the nodes 0, 2, 7, or 9. Let's find the number of 3-stars for each potential central node:

For node 0:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8
- Possible 3-stars with node 0 as the center:
  - <0, (2, 5, 6)>
  - <0, (2, 5, 7)>
  - <0, (2, 5, 8)>
  - <0, (6, 1, 7)>
  - <0, (7, 4, 5)>
  - <0, (7, 4, 6)>
- Total: 6

For node 2:
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 9
- Possible 3-stars with node 2 as the center:
  - <2, (0, 5, 7)>
  - <2, (0, 6, 1)>
  - <2, (0, 7, 4)>
  - <2, (0, 7, 5)>
  - <2, (0, 7, 6)>
- Total: 5

For node 7:
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 5
- Possible 3-stars with node 7 as the center:
  - <7, (0, 5, 7)>
  - <7, (0, 6, 1)>
  - <7, (0, 7, 4)>
  - <7, (0, 5, 6)>
- Total: 4

For node 9:
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2 and 8
- Possible 3-stars with node 9 as the center:
  - <9, (2, 0, 6)>
  - <9, (2, 0, 7)>
  - <9, (2, 3, 0)>
- Total: 3

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6 + 5 + 4 + 3] = [18].
