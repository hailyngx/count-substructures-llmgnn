Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 6

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph. 
A 3-star is formed when a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list the 3-stars found in this graph:

<0, (3, 4, 6)>
<3, (0, 7, 9)>
<4, (0, 1, 5)>
<6, (0, 2, 9)>

Now, we count the number of unique 3-stars found in the graph [4].
