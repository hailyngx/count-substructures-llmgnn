Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 3

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star pattern.

Looking at the provided graph, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (4, 9)>
<1, (5, 8)>
<2, (4, 6)>
<3, (9)>
<4, (0, 2)>
<5, (1, 8)>
<6, (2, 7)>
<7, (6)>
<8, (1, 5)>
<9, (0, 3)>

Counting the unique 3-stars found is [10].
