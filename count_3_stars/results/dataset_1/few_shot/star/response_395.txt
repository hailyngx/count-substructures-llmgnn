Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Looking at the adjacency list and the given edges, we can determine the 3-stars in the graph:

<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<1, (0, 4, 7)>
<1, (2, 3, 7)>
<1, (3, 4, 9)>
<3, (1, 4, 9)>
<4, (1, 3, 9)>
<7, (1, 3, 9)>
<9, (1, 3, 4)>

There are a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
