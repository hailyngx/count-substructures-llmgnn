Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will look for each unique 3-star pattern.

The 3-star patterns in this graph are:
<0, (9, 1, 7)>
<1, (9, 0, 7)>
<2, (4, 7, 8)>
<3, (5, 6, 7)>
<4, (2, 7, 8)>
<4, (7, 2, 8)>
<5, (3, 6, 7)>
<5, (6, 3, 7)>
<6, (5, 3, 7)>
<7, (4, 2, 8)>
<7, (4, 7, 8)>
<7, (4, 8, 2)>
<7, (6, 5, 3)>
<7, (6, 3, 5)>
<7, (8, 4, 2)>
<7, (8, 2, 4)>
<8, (4, 2, 7)>
<8, (4, 7, 2)>
<9, (0, 1, 7)>
<9, (1, 0, 7)>
