Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique instance where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

The 3-stars in this graph are:
<0, (5, 7, 8)>
<1, (2, 5, 7)>
<5, (0, 1, 9)>
<6, (3, 5, 7)>
<7, (0, 1, 2)>

Count of 3-stars: [5]
