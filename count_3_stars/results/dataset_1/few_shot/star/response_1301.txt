Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern.

Let's analyze the graph:

Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 7, and 8.
Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 6, and 8. (This forms a 3-star with 2 as the central node: <2, (1, 6, 8)>)
Node 3 is connected to nodes 4 and 5.
Node 4 is connected to nodes 3 and 6.
Node 5 is connected to nodes 3, 6, and 7.
Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 5, and 9. (This forms a 3-star with 6 as the central node: <6, (2, 4, 5)>)
Node 7 is connected to nodes 1 and 5.
Node 8 is connected to nodes 1 and 2.
Node 9 is connected to node 6.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are:
<2, (1, 6, 8)>
<6, (2, 4, 5)>

As there are 2 unique 3-stars in the graph, the final count is [2].
