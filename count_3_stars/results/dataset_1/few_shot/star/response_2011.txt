Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 7

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
- Node 0: <0, (2, 3, 7)>
- Node 1: <1, (3, 7, 9)>
- Node 2: <2, (0, 4, 6)> and <2, (0, 6, 8)>
- Node 3: <3, (0, 1, 5)> and <3, (1, 5, 8)>
- Node 7: <7, (0, 1, 9)>
- Node 9: <9, (1, 7, 0)>

Therefore, there are a total of [7] 3-stars in the given graph.
