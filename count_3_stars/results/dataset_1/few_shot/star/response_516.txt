Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 7

Response:
The 3-star graphs can be identified by finding nodes that are connected to exactly 3 other nodes. Let's list the 3-stars found in the given graph:

<3, (5, 7, 9)>
<4, (6, 7, -)> where '-' represents an isolated node
<7, (0, 3, 8)>
<8, (2, 7, -)> where '-' represents an isolated node
<9, (3, 7, -)> where '-' represents an isolated node

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
