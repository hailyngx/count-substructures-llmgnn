Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars in the given graph.
Since a 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes, we need to find nodes in the graph that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

From the adjacency list, nodes 1, 4, and 8 are connected to exactly three other nodes each. These nodes can serve as the center of a 3-star.

Now, let's list the 3-stars using the identified center nodes:
<1, (3, 7, 8)>
<4, (5, 6, -)>
<8, (0, 1, 7)>

There are a total of three 3-stars in the given graph.
Therefore, the final answer is [3].
