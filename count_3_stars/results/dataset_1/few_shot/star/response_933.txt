Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 3

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars, we need to identify each unique 3-star in the graph and then count them. 

The unique 3-stars in the given graph are:
<0, (2, 4, 7)>
<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<0, (4, 1, 8)>
<2, (0, 4, 7)>
<2, (5, 1, 6)>
<2, (6, 0, 4)>
<5, (1, 4, 8)>
<5, (3, 0, 7)>
<5, (4, 1, 8)>
<6, (0, 3, 5)>
<6, (1, 4, 8)>
<6, (2, 5, 7)>
<7, (0, 2, 5)>
<7, (2, 5, 1)>
<7, (5, 1, 4)>
<8, (1, 4, 6)>
<8, (4, 1, 5)>
<8, (6, 1, 4)>

By counting the number of unique 3-stars, we find that there are [18] 3-stars in the given graph.
