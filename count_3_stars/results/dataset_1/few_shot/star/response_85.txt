Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 5, 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern.

From the adjacency list provided, the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 5, 9)>
<1, (0, 5, 9)>
<3, (5, 9, 0)>
<6, (1, 7, 8)>
<8, (6, 7, 9)>

Therefore, there are [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
