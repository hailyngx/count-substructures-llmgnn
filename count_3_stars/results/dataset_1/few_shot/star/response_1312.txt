Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, and node 8

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<2, (1, 6, 9)>
<3, (1)>
<4, (0, 7, 9)>
<5, (1, 8, 9)>
<6, (0, 2, 9)>
<7, (4, 9)>
<8, (5, 9)>
<9, (0, 2, 4)>

Total number of 3-stars: [9]
