Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a star-like structure. 

Let's go through the nodes one by one to find all 3-stars:

1. Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 4, and 6: <0, (2, 4, 6)>
2. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 3, and 5: <1, (2, 3, 5)>
3. Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, and 9: <2, (0, 1, 9)>
4. Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 4, and 9: <3, (1, 4, 9)>
5. Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 7, and 9: <5, (1, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
