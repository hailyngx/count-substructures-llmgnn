Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-star structures in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes (forming a 3-star pattern).

From the adjacency list provided, we can identify the following 3-star structures:
<1, (0, 4, 5)>
<2, (5, 7, 8)>
<3, (4, 5, 6)>
<4, (1, 3, 7)>
<5, (1, 2, 3)>
<9, (1, 2, 3)>

Therefore, we have identified 6 unique 3-star structures in the given graph.
