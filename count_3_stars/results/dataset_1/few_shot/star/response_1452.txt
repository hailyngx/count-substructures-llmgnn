Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to understand that a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. In this graph, we are looking for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

From the adjacency list provided, we can identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 0: Connected to nodes 4, 5, 6 (3 nodes)
- Node 1: Connected to nodes 2, 3, 4 (3 nodes)
- Node 2: Connected to nodes 1, 3, 5 (3 nodes)
- Node 4: Connected to nodes 0, 1, 5 (3 nodes)
- Node 5: Connected to nodes 0, 2, 4 (3 nodes)
- Node 6: Connected to nodes 0, 1, 2 (3 nodes)
- Node 9: Connected to nodes 2, 3, 4 (3 nodes)

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

There are <0, (4, 5, 6)> and <1, (2, 3, 4)>.
Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
