Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 7

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph:

<1, (4, 7, 8)>
<3, (0, 7, 8)>
<5, (3, 4, 6)>
<7, (1, 3, 9)>
<8, (1, 3, 5)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-star graphs in the given graph.
