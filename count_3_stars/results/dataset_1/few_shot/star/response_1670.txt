Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 4
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
There are 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph. <0, (2, 5, 8)> and <5, (1, 3, 6)>.  
So, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
