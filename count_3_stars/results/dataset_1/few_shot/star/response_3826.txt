Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 7
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 7

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the graph by finding the central node and its connected nodes.

1. Central Node: Count the degree of each node. The node with a degree of 3 will be considered the central node in each 3-star.

2. Connected Nodes: For each central node found in the previous step, list the nodes it is connected to.

Let's find the 3-stars step by step.

Degree of each node:
- Node 0: 1
- Node 1: 1
- Node 2: 2
- Node 3: 2
- Node 4: 0
- Node 5: 3
- Node 6: 0
- Node 7: 2
- Node 8: 1
- Node 9: 2

3-stars found:
<2, (0, 5)>
<3, (8, 9)>
<5, (1, 2, 7)>
<7, (5, 9)>
