Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify the 3-stars by looking for central nodes connected to exactly three other nodes.

The three nodes connected to each central node will form the leaves of the 3-star.

Let's list the unique 3-stars found:

<1, (2, 5, 7)>
<2, (1, 3, 8)>
<5, (0, 1, 3)>
<5, (1, 3, 6)>
<6, (4, 5, 9)>
<7, (1, 4, 5)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph [6].
