Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the 3-star subgraphs in the graph. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we can identify the central nodes (nodes with exactly 3 neighbors) and the corresponding leaves. Let's list them:

<0, (2, 5, 7)>
<1, (2, 7, 8)>
<2, (0, 1, 5)>
<4, (5, 7, 9)>
<5, (0, 2, 4)>
<7, (0, 1, 2)>
<9, (3, 4, 5)>

Count of 3-stars: [7]
