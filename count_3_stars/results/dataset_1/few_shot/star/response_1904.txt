Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 6, and node 8

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 

Taking each node as the center of a potential 3-star: 

1. Node 0: <0, (2, 5, 6)> - Not a 3-star because not all leaf nodes are connected directly to the center node.
2. Node 1: <1, (2, 4, 6)> - Not a 3-star because not all leaf nodes are connected directly to the center node.
3. Node 2: <2, (0, 1, 3)>
4. Node 3: No 3-star centered at Node 3.
5. Node 4: <4, (1, 3, 7)>
6. Node 5: <5, (0, 6, -)> - Not a 3-star because it doesn't have three connected leaves.
7. Node 6: <6, (0, 1, 9)>
8. Node 7: No 3-star centered at Node 7.
9. Node 8: No 3-star centered at Node 8.
10. Node 9: <9, (6, 8, -)> - Not a 3-star because it doesn't have three connected leaves.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: <2, (0, 1, 3)> and <6, (0, 1, 9)>.
