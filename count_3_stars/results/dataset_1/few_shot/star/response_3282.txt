Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 7, and node 8

Response:
We know that a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars in this given graph step-by-step:

1. Start with the central node, its adjacent nodes should be exactly three to form a 3-star.
2. For each node, check if its neighbors can form a 3-star along with the central node.

Here are the 3-stars in the given graph:

[6] (0, 2, 7)
[8] (2, 4, 9)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
