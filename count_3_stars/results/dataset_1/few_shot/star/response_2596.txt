Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 6, and node 8

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are as follows: 
<1, (2, 3, 8)>
<2, (1, 6, 7)>
<6, (2, 4, 5)>
<8, (1, 9, -)>
<9, (6, 8, -)>

Therefore, there are [5] 3-stars in the graph.
