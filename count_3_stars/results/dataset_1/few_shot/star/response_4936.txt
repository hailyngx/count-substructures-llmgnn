Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that have exactly three neighbors forming a 3-star pattern with that node as the center. 

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 0: (4, 6, 9)
2. Node 2: (1, 9, 0)
3. Node 6: (4, 0, 9)
4. Node 9: (0, 2, 6)

Therefore, there are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

The final answer is [4].

<0, (4, 6, 9)>
<2, (1, 9, 0)>
<6, (4, 0, 9)>
<9, (0, 2, 6)>
