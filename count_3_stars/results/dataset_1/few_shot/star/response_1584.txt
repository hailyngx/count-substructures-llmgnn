Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern. Let's identify the 3-stars:

<0, (5, 6, 7)>
<2, (3, 5, 8)>
<3, (2, 4, 5)>
<5, (0, 2, 6)>
<5, (2, 3, 8)>
<7, (1, 4, 9)>
<7, (4, 5, 8)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
