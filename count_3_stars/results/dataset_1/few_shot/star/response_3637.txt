Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's start by identifying the 3-stars in the graph:

<1, (3, 4, 9)>
<4, (1, 5, 8)>
<5, (4, 6, 9)>
<7, (5, 6, 8)>
<8, (4, 7, 9)>
<9, (1, 5, 8)>

Count of 3-stars: [6]
