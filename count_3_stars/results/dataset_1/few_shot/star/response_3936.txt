Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 4, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify these 3-stars:

<0, (2, 5, 6)>
<0, (2, 5, 8)>
<0, (2, 5, 9)>
<0, (2, 6, 8)>
<0, (2, 6, 9)>
<0, (2, 8, 9)>
<0, (5, 6, 8)>
<0, (5, 6, 9)>
<0, (5, 8, 9)>
<5, (0, 6, 8)>
<5, (0, 6, 9)>

[The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 10]
