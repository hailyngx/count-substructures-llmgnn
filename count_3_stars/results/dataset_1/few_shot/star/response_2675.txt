Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star individually. 

Let's list down the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (4, 9, 2)>
<4, (0, 6, 2)>
<6, (3, 5, 9)>
<9, (0, 6, 8)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph.
