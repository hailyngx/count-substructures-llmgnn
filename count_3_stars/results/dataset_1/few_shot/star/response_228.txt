Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 6

Response:
First, we need to identify all the 3-stars in the given graph. 
Let's list them:

<0, (3, 7, 4)>
<1, (4, 8, 2)>
<2, (8, 5, 4)>
<4, (7, 1, 9)>
<7, (3, 0, 4)>
<8, (1, 2, 5)>
<9, (2, 4, 6)>

Counting the number of 3-stars in the graph, we find a total of [7].
