Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 7
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 8

Response:
The first step is to identify all the 3-stars present in the graph. 

Next, let's find the 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (3, 5, 7)>
<3, (0, 8, 7)>
<7, (0, 4, 6)>
<8, (3, 9, -)>

Count of 3-stars: [4]
