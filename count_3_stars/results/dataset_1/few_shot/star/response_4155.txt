Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all unique instances where a node is at the center of a 3-star configuration. 

Looking at the adjacency list for each node, we can see that a 3-star occurs when a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify these 3-stars:

1. Node 0: <0, (1, 6, 7)>
2. Node 1: <1, (0, 3, 5)>
3. Node 2: <2, (5, 7, 9)>
4. Node 3: <3, (1, 5, 9)>
5. Node 5: <5, (1, 2, 9)>
6. Node 7: <7, (0, 2, 5)>
7. Node 9: <9, (0, 3, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
