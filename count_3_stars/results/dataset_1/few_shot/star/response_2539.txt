Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for each node that has exactly three neighbors, with the condition that the three neighbors are not connected to each other. 

Based on the information provided, below are the 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<2, (1, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
