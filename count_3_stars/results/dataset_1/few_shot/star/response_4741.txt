Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 8

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (4, 5, 6)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star: <5, (0, 1, 2)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star: <6, (1, 4, 9)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star: <8, (4, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
