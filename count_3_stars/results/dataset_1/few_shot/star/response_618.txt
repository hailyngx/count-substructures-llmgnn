Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a 3-star structure. 

Looking at the provided graph, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (3, 6, 7)>
<1, (4, 5, 7)>
<1, (5, 4, 8)>
<5, (1, 4, 6)>
<5, (4, 1, 8)>
<5, (6, 0, 8)>

Counting these unique 3-star structures, we find a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
