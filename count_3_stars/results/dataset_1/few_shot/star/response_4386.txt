Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 8

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we can see that the nodes that meet this criterion are: 
- Node 0: Connected to nodes 5, 6, and 8
- Node 1: Connected to nodes 4, 5, and 7
- Node 2: Connected to nodes 4 and 7
- Node 6: Connected to nodes 0, 3, and 8
- Node 7: Connected to nodes 1, 2, and 8
- Node 8: Connected to nodes 0, 6, and 7
- Node 9: Connected to nodes 5, 7, and 8

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are: 
<0, (5, 6, 8)>
<1, (4, 5, 7)>
<6, (0, 3, 8)>
<7, (1, 2, 8)>
<8, (0, 6, 7)>
<9, (5, 7, 8)>

So, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
