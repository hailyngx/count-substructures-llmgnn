Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 8

Response:
Given the graph and the adjacency list, we can analyze the connections to identify the 3-star subgraphs. 

We observe that the 3-star subgraphs can be identified by finding nodes with exactly three neighbors. 
Let's list the nodes with 3 neighbors:
- Node 1 has neighbors 3, 4, and 8
- Node 3 has neighbors 1, 2, and 8
- Node 4 has neighbors 1, 5, and 8
- Node 8 has neighbors 0, 1, and 9

Now, we can form the 3-star subgraphs:
<1, (3, 4, 8)>
<3, (1, 2, 8)>
<4, (1, 5, 8)>
<8, (0, 1, 9)>

There are [4] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
