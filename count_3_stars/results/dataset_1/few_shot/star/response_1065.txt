Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 8

Response:
Given the graph information, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Start by looking for nodes that are connected to exactly 3 other nodes. These nodes will act as the centers of potential 3-stars.

2. For each potential center node, check if it is connected to exactly 3 other nodes and if these nodes are not connected to each other (to ensure they form a single 3-star).

Based on the provided information, the 3-stars in the graph are as follows:

<1, (3, 6, 8)>
<1, (3, 8, 9)>
<3, (1, 2, 7)>
<3, (1, 7, 8)>
<3, (2, 7, 4)>
<8, (1, 3, 6)>
<8, (1, 3, 7)>
<8, (4, 7, 9)>
<8, (6, 7, 9)>
<8, (0, 9, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
