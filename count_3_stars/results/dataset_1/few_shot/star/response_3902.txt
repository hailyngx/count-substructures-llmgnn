Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 3

Response:
There are 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

The 3-stars are:

<2, (1, 7, 9)>
<5, (3, 7, 8)>
<6, (2, 3, 4)>
<7, (1, 2, 4)>
<8, (2, 4, 5)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
