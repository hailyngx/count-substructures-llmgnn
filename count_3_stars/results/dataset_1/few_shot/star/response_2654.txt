Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 4

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Starting from each node, we will look for connected nodes that form a 3-star with the current node as the center. Let's list the unique 3-stars we find:

<0, (3, 7)>
<1, (2, 7, 8)>
<2, (1, 5, 8)>
<3, (0, 4, 5)>
<4, (3, 5, 6)>
<5, (2, 4, 6)>
<6, (4, 5, 8)>
<7, (0, 1, 8)>
<8, (1, 5, 6)>
<9, (4)>

Counting the unique 3-stars gives us a total of [9].
