Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph, we need to identify the central node and the three leaves for each 3-star.

Let's analyze the graph to find all possible 3-star configurations:

1. Node 0: No 3-star can be formed around node 0 as it only has one connection.

2. Node 1: <1, (0, 9, 2)>.

3. Node 2: <2, (4, 7, 9)>.

4. Node 3: No 3-star can be formed around node 3 as it only has one connection.

5. Node 4: <4, (2, 5, 6)>.

6. Node 5: No 3-star can be formed around node 5 as it only has one connection.

7. Node 6: No 3-star can be formed around node 6 as it only has two connections.

8. Node 7: <7, (2, 8, 9)>.

9. Node 8: No 3-star can be formed around node 8 as it only has one connection.

10. Node 9: <9, (1, 2, 7)>.

So, there are a total of [3] 3-star graphs in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (0, 9, 2)>
<2, (4, 7, 9)> 
<4, (2, 5, 6)>
<7, (2, 8, 9)>
