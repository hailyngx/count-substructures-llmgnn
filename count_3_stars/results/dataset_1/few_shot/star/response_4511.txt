Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 5, and node 7

Response:
There are 4 3-stars in this graph. Here are the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (1, 5, 9)>
<1, (0, 2, 7)>
<3, (1, 4, 9)>
<9, (0, 3, 4)> 

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
