Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can first identify the central nodes and their corresponding leaves. 

The central nodes in this graph are nodes 0, 2, and 8 since they each have exactly 3 neighbors.

For each central node:
- Node 0 has leaves 2, 6, and 7
- Node 2 has leaves 0, 3, and 8
- Node 8 has leaves 0, 1, and 9

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars:
<0, (2, 6, 7)>
<2, (0, 3, 8)>
<8, (0, 1, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
