Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Looking at the adjacency list, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:
1. <1, (5, 7, 8)>
2. <2, (5, 7, 8)>
3. <5, (1, 2, 8)>
4. <7, (1, 2, 8)>
5. <8, (1, 5, 7)>

Count of 3-stars: [5]
