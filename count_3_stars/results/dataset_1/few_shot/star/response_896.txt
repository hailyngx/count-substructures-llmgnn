Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes (forming a 3-star pattern).

Looking at the adjacency list and listening the possible 3-stars we have:
<0, (2, 4, 8)>
<1, (5, 7)>
<2, (0, 5, 7)>
<3, (5, 7, 9)>
<4, (0, 8)>
<5, (1, 2, 3)>
<6, (0, 5, 8)>
<7, (1, 2, 3)>
<8, (0, 4, 5)>
<9, (2, 3, 7)>

So, there are 9 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
Therefore, the final answer is [9].
