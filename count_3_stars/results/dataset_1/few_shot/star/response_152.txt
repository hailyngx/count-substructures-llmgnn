Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 5, and 8
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 2, and 4
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 2, and 6
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 3, and 4

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].

Unique 3-stars: 
- <0, (1, 5, 8)>
- <1, (0, 2, 4)>
- <5, (0, 2, 6)>
- <8, (0, 3, 4)>
