Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 7

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that can act as the center of a 3-star. 
Looking at the adjacency list, nodes 0, 2, 6, and 9 have connections with exactly 3 other nodes, which makes them potential centers for 3-stars.

Now, let's explore each potential center:
1. For node 0: 
   - Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 6, and 8. Potential 3-stars:
     <0, (1, 2, 6)>
     <0, (1, 2, 8)>
     [2 unique 3-stars with 0 as the center]
  
2. For node 2:
   - Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 9. Potential 3-star:
     <2, (0, 3, 9)>
     [1 unique 3-star with 2 as the center]
  
3. For node 6:
   - Node 6 is connected to nodes 0 and 1. Since it doesn't have 3 connections, it cannot be the center of a 3-star.

4. For node 9:
   - Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 5, and 7. Potential 3-star:
     <9, (2, 3, 5)>
     <9, (2, 3, 7)>
     [2 unique 3-stars with 9 as the center]

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars in the given graph is [5]. 
The unique 3-stars are <0, (1, 2, 6)>, <0, (1, 2, 8)>, <2, (0, 3, 9)>, <9, (2, 3, 5)>, and <9, (2, 3, 7)>.
