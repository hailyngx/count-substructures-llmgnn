Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 6

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- Node 0: <0, (4, 5, 6)>
- Node 5: <5, (0, 2, 3)>
- Node 6: <6, (0, 2, 7)>
