Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star configuration.

Upon reviewing the graph and adjacency list provided, we can list the 3-stars as follows:

<1, (3, 5, 7)>
<7, (1, 6, 9)>
<9, (7, 8, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
