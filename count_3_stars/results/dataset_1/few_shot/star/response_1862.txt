Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 1) (9, 0) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 1

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node has exactly three edges (which form 3-stars with that node as the center).

Nodes 0 and 1 each have degree 3, which means they are the centers of two 3-stars. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (1, 5, 9)>
<1, (0, 5, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
