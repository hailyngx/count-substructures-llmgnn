Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 7

Response:
Given the information provided, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph. Let's list them step by step:

1. Identifying nodes with 3 edges:
   - Node 1 and Node 4 have 3 edges, making them potential centers of 3-stars.

2. Checking the neighbors of these potential center nodes:
   - For Node 1: (0, 3, 6)
   - For Node 4: (2, 3, 7, 8, 9)

3. Counting the number of 3-stars:
   - For Node 1: There is one 3-star centered at Node 1: <1, (0, 3, 6)>
   - For Node 4: There is no 3-star centered at Node 4.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1].
The unique 3-star found is <1, (0, 3, 6)>.
