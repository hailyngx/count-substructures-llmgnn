Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (9, 1) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 5
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 5

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step by step to identify these 3-stars:

1. Node 0: Forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 3, and 5. <0, (2, 3, 5)>
2. Node 1: Does not form a 3-star since it is connected to only two nodes.
3. Node 2: Does not form a 3-star since it is connected to only two nodes.
4. Node 3: Does not form a 3-star since it is connected to only two nodes.
5. Node 4: Does not form a 3-star since it is connected to only two nodes.
6. Node 5: Forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 6, and 7. <5, (0, 6, 7)>
7. Node 6: Does not form a 3-star since it is connected to only two nodes.
8. Node 7: Does not form a 3-star since it is connected to only three nodes and not one other node.
9. Node 8: Does not form a 3-star since it is not connected to any other nodes.
10. Node 9: Does not form a 3-star since it is connected to only two nodes.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2]. The unique 3-stars found are <0, (2, 3, 5)> and <5, (0, 6, 7)>.
