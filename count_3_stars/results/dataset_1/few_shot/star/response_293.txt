Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (3, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list the 3-stars found in the given graph:
<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<0, (6, 7, 9)>
<6, (0, 1, 5)>
<6, (0, 7, 9)>
<7, (0, 1, 6)>
<7, (0, 6, 9)>
<9, (0, 7, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
