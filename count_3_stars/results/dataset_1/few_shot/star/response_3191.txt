Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 7

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be found by first identifying nodes that have exactly three neighbors to form 3-stars. Then, we count the number of 3-stars by considering each qualifying node as the center.

Nodes with exactly three neighbors: Node 0, Node 3, and Node 4 have exactly three neighbors each.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars centered at each of these nodes:

For Node 0:
- <0, (2, 5, 6)>

For Node 3:
- <3, (5, 6, 8)>

For Node 4:
- <4, (2, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
