Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can iterate through each node and check if it satisfies the conditions of being a 3-star. 

Observations:
1. For a 3-star to exist, the center node needs to have exactly three neighbors.
2. For each neighbor of the center node, those neighbors should not be directly connected to each other. This is to ensure that the 3-star is not part of a larger connected structure.

Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. For Node 0:
    - Node 0 meets the condition of having exactly three neighbors: 1, 2, and 3.
    - Checking neighbors of 0:
        - (1, 6) and (3, 6) are connected, violating the 3-star condition.

2. For Node 1:
    - Node 1 meets the condition of having exactly three neighbors: 0, 8, and 9.
    - Checking neighbors of 1:
        - (0, 6) is connected, violating the 3-star condition.

3. For Node 2:
    - Node 2 does not have three neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.

4. For Node 3:
    - Node 3 does not have three neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.

5. For Node 4:
    - Node 4 does not have three neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.

6. For Node 5:
    - Node 5 does not have three neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.

7. For Node 6:
    - Node 6 meets the condition of having exactly three neighbors: 0, 1, and 5.
    - Possible 3-star: <6, (0, 1, 5)>
    - Visually, we can see that (0, 1) and (1, 5) are not directly connected, so this forms a valid 3-star.

8. For Node 7:
    - Node 7 does not have three neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.

9. For Node 8:
    - Node 8 does not have three neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.

10. For Node 9:
    - Node 9 does not have three neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.

Based on the analysis above, the <6, (0, 1, 5)> 3-star is found in the given graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1].
