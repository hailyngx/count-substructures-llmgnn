Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through each node one by one:

- Node 0: Not part of any 3-star.
- Node 1: Forms a 3-star with nodes (2, 5, 7). <1, (2, 5, 7)>
- Node 2: Forms a 3-star with nodes (1, 3, 7). <2, (1, 3, 7)>
- Node 3: Forms a 3-star with nodes (2, 4, 7). <3, (2, 4, 7)>
- Node 4: Forms a 3-star with nodes (0, 3, 9). <4, (0, 3, 9)>
- Node 5: Not part of any 3-star.
- Node 6: Not part of any 3-star.
- Node 7: Forms a 3-star with nodes (1, 2, 3) and (3, 6, 7). <7, (1, 2, 3)> <7, (3, 6, 7)>
- Node 8: Not part of any 3-star.
- Node 9: Not part of any 3-star.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5]. The unique 3-stars are <1, (2, 5, 7)>, <2, (1, 3, 7)>, <3, (2, 4, 7)>, <4, (0, 3, 9)>, <7, (1, 2, 3)>, and <7, (3, 6, 7)>.
