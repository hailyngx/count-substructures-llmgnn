Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 3

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph based on the definition provided. 

The central node of a 3-star must have degree 3 and be connected to exactly three leaves. 

From the given information, the nodes that satisfy this condition are:
- Node 2: Connected to 3, 4, 6, 7, and 9
- Node 3: Connected to 2, 5, 7, 8, and 9
- Node 4: Connected to 1, 2, 6, and 7
- Node 6: Connected to 0, 2, 4, and 8

Let's list the unique 3-stars present in the graph:
<2, (3, 4, 6)>
<3, (2, 4, 7)>
<4, (1, 6, 7)>
<6, (0, 2, 4)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars: [4].
