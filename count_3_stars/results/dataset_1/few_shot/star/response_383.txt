Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, and node 7

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:
Based on the definition of a 3-star graph, we are looking for each central node and its three connected nodes forming a 3-star pattern.

1. For Node 1:
<1, (2, 4, 8)>
<1, (2, 4, 9)>

2. For Node 2:
<2, (1, 6, 8)>
<2, (1, 7, 8)>
<2, (1, 6, 9)>
<2, (1, 7, 9)>

3. For Node 3:
No 3-star centered at Node 3.

4. For Node 4:
No 3-star centered at Node 4.

5. For Node 5:
No 3-star centered at Node 5.

6. For Node 6:
No 3-star centered at Node 6.

7. For Node 7:
No 3-star centered at Node 7.

8. For Node 8:
<8, (1, 2, 6)>
<8, (1, 2, 7)>

9. For Node 9:
No 3-star centered at Node 9.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
