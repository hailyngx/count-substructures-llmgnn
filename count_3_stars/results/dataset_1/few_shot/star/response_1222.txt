Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 2

Response:
The graph contains the following 3-stars:
<0, (2, 8, 9)>
<2, (0, 4, 9)>
<4, (0, 2, 8)>
<8, (0, 1, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
