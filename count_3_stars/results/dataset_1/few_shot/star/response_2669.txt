Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (4, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to find all possible 3-stars by looking for nodes that have exactly three neighbors and forming stars around them.

In this graph, the potential center nodes are 2, 5, and 6 because they each have exactly three neighbors. Let's go through each of them and find the 3-stars:

For node 2:
- <2, (0, 1, 7)>
- <2, (1, 5, 6)>
Total: 2

For node 5:
- <5, (2, 7, 9)>
- <5, (7, 2, 9)>
Total: 2

For node 6:
- <6, (2, 3, 8)>
- <6, (2, 8, 9)>
Total: 2

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
