Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

1. Node 0: (0, 3, 5, 6)
2. Node 1: (1, 2, 4, 6)
3. Node 2: (1, 2, 3, 5)
4. Node 3: (0, 2, 6)
5. Node 4: (1, 2, 8, 9)
6. Node 5: (0, 2, 6, 7)
7. Node 6: (0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 8)
8. Node 8: (4, 5, 6)
9. Node 9: (4)

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].  

Unique 3-stars found: 
<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<2, (1, 3, 5)>
<4, (1, 2, 8, 9)>
<5, (0, 2, 6, 7)>
