Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 3

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will identify each unique 3-star and then count them. 

Let's start by finding the 3-stars in the graph:
1. <0, (2, 8)>
2. <1, (3, 4, 7)>
3. <3, (1, 7, 9)>
4. <4, (1, 5, 7)>
5. <7, (1, 3, 4)>
6. <8, (0, 5, 7)>

Now that we have listed all the unique 3-stars, let's count them.
