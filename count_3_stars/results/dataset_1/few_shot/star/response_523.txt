Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars present. 

Starting from the given graph information, we list out the unique 3-stars below:

<0, (4, 6, 7)>
<1, (2, 4, 5)>
<1, (4, 7, 9)>
<2, (1, 7, 9)>
<7, (0, 1, 3)>
<7, (1, 2, 9)>

Count of 3-stars in the graph: [6]
