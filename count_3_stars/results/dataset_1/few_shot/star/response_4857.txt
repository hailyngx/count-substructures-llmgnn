Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, as per the definition of a 3-star.

Here are the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<2, (4, 5, 8)>
<2, (4, 5, 9)>
<2, (4, 8, 9)>
<3, (4, 6, 9)>
<3, (4, 8, 9)>
<3, (6, 8, 9)>
<5, (0, 2, 9)>
<5, (2, 7, 9)>
<6, (3, 8, 9)>

Count of 3-stars: [9]
