Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 7

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each instance where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through each node and find all unique 3-stars:

<1, (3, 5, 6)>
<1, (3, 6, 7)>
<1, (5, 6, 7)>
<4, (5, 6, 9)>
<4, (5, 7, 9)>
<4, (6, 7, 9)>
<5, (1, 4, 8)>
<5, (1, 6, 9)>
<5, (4, 6, 9)>
<5, (6, 8, 9)>
<6, (1, 4, 7)>
<6, (1, 7, 9)>
<6, (4, 7, 9)>
<6, (7, 8, 9)>
<7, (1, 6, 8)>
<7, (1, 6, 9)>
<7, (6, 8, 9)>
<9, (4, 5, 7)>
<9, (5, 7, 9)>

Count of 3-stars: [19]
