Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6

Response:
Based on the given information, let's calculate the number of 3-stars in the graph:

1. Identify the nodes that form 3-stars:
    - Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 5, 6, 7, 8
    - Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 2, 3, 6
    - Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 1, 6, 7
    - Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 1, 4, 8
    - Node 4 has 2 neighbors: 3, 5
    - Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 0, 4, 6, 8
    - Node 6 has 6 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 5, 8, 9
    - Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 0, 2, 8
    - Node 8 has 5 neighbors: 0, 3, 5, 6, 7
    - Node 9 has 1 neighbor: 6

2. Count the number of 3-stars:
    - Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 6, 7 as leaves: <0, (5, 6, 7)>
    - Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 6, 8 as leaves: <5, (0, 6, 8)>
    - Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, 5 as leaves: <6, (0, 1, 5)>
