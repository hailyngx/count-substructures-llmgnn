Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes, which forms a 3-star pattern. 

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 0: Connected to nodes 3, 6, and 9
2. Node 4: Connected to nodes 1, 6, and 9
3. Node 8: Connected to nodes 3, 7, and 9

Therefore, there are 3 unique 3-stars in the given graph: 
<0, (3, 6, 9)>
<4, (1, 6, 9)>
<8, (3, 7, 9)>

[The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 3.]
