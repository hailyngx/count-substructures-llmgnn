Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (8, 3) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 6
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the given graph, we can identify the following 3-star structures:
<0, (4, 6, 9)>
<3, (4, 8, -)>
<4, (0, 3, -)>
<6, (0, 1, -)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4]. 
Here are the unique 3-stars: 
<0, (4, 6, 9)>
<3, (4, 8, -)>
<4, (0, 3, -)>
<6, (0, 1, -)>
