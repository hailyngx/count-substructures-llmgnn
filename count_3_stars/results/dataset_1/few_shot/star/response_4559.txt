Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars present in the graph.

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<1, (0, 8, 9)>
<1, (7, 8, 9)>
<(0, 1, 8), 9>
<(1, 8, 9), 7> 

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph:
[4]
