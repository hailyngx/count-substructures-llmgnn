Node 8 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 7

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's start by examining each node and its connections to identify 3-stars:

1. For Node 0:
   Node 0 is not part of any 3-star as it is only connected to node 8.

2. For Node 1:
   Node 1 is part of the following 3-stars:
   <1, (2, 3, 7)> 

3. For Node 2:
   Node 2 is part of the following 3-stars:
   <2, (1, 3, 5)>

4. For Node 3:
   Node 3 is part of the following 3-stars:
   <3, (1, 2, 4)>
   <3, (1, 4, 7)>
   
5. For Node 4:
   Node 4 is not part of any 3-star as it is connected to 4 nodes.

6. For Node 5:
   Node 5 is not part of any 3-star as it is connected to only 2 nodes.

7. For Node 6:
   Node 6 is not part of any 3-star as it is connected to only 2 nodes.

8. For Node 7:
   Node 7 is part of the following 3-stars:
   <7, (1, 3, 4)>
   <7, (1, 4, 9)>

9. For Node 8:
   Node 8 is not part of any 3-star as it is connected to only 3 nodes.

10. For Node 9:
    Node 9 is not part of any 3-star as it is connected to 4 nodes.

Based on the above analysis, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4] and they are:
<1, (2, 3, 7)>
<2, (1, 3, 5)>
<3, (1, 2, 4)>
<7, (1, 3, 4)>
