Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 7
