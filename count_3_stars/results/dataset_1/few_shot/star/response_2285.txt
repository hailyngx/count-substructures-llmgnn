Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 2) (6, 2) (7, 2) (8, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 2
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes and their adjacent nodes. 
Central nodes have exactly three neighbors. 
From the given graph:
- Node 2 is a central node with 5 neighbors.
- Node 1 is a central node with 3 neighbors.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:
- For node 2, the possible 3-stars are <2, (1, 4, 6)>, <2, (1, 4, 7)>, <2, (1, 4, 8)>.
- For node 1, the possible 3-star is <1, (2, 3, 4)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
<2, (1, 4, 6)>, <2, (1, 4, 7)>, <2, (1, 4, 8)>, <1, (2, 3, 4)>
