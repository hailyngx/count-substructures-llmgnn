Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 8

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star structures in the graph:

1. Node 0: <0, (1, 2, 3)>
2. Node 2: <2, (0, 4, 6)>
3. Node 7: <7, (1, 4, 6)>
4. Node 9: <9, (2, 3, 8)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
