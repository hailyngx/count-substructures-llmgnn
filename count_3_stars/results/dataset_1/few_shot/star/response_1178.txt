Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Based on the given information, let's identify the 3-stars:

1. Node 1: (1, 2, 4, 5), (1, 5, 6, 7)
2. Node 5: (5, 1, 4, 6), (5, 6, 9, 1)
3. Node 6: (6, 1, 5, 7), (6, 5, 7, 8)
4. Node 7: (7, 1, 2, 6), (7, 6, 8, 1)
5. Node 8: (8, 3, 6, 7), (8, 6, 7, 9)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5]. 

<1, (2, 4, 5)>, <1, (5, 6, 7)>, <5, (1, 4, 6)>, <5, (6, 9, 1)>, <6, (1, 5, 7)>, <6, (5, 7, 8)>, <7, (1, 2, 6)>, <7, (6, 8, 1)>, <8, (3, 6, 7)>, <8, (6, 7, 9)>
