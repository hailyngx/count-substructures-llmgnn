Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 7

Response:
The 3-star structures in the given graph are as follows:
<0, (6, 9)>
<1, (6, 8)>
<2, (4, 7, 8)>
<4, (2, 5, 7)>
<7, (2, 4, 9)>

Therefore, there are a total of [5] 3-star structures in the graph.
