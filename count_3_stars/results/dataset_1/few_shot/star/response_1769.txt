Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node has exactly three neighbors and one of them is the center node connected to the other two.

Let's identify all the 3-stars in the graph:
1. <0, (1, 9)>
2. <1, (0, 2, 4)>
3. <1, (0, 5, 8)>
4. <2, (1, 4, 5)>
5. <2, (1, 5, 7)>
6. <3, (2, 6)>
7. <4, (1, 2)>
8. <5, (1, 2, 8)>
9. <8, (1, 5)>

Count of 3-stars in the given graph: [9]
