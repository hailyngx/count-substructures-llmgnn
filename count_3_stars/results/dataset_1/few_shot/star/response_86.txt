Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 3

Response:
The graph described has the following 3-stars: 

<0, (1, 9, 3)>
<2, (4, 8, 9)>
<3, (1, 6, 7)>
<5, (7, 8, 3)>
