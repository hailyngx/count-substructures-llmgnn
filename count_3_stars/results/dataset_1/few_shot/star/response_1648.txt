Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (5, 3) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 9
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 8

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are as follows: 
<0, (2, 1, 8)>
<1, (2, 3, 9)>
<8, (0, 1, 9)>
<9, (1, 3, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
