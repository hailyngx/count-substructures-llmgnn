Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 5

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Let's go through each node to identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0: <0, (2, 5, 6)>, <0, (2, 6, 7)>, <0, (2, 7, 8)>, <0, (5, 6, 8)> (4 3-stars)
- Node 1: <1, (6, 7, 8)>, <1, (6, 7, 9)> (2 3-stars)
- Node 2: This node is not part of any 3-star as it is connected to only two nodes.
- Node 3: This node is not part of any 3-star as it is connected to only two nodes.
- Node 4: <4, (2, 7, 6)> (1 3-star)
- Node 5: <5, (0, 8, 9)>, <5, (8, 9, 1)> (2 3-stars)
- Node 6: <6, (0, 1, 7)> (1 3-star)
- Node 7: <7, (0, 1, 6)> (1 3-star)
- Node 8: <8, (0, 1, 5)> (1 3-star)
- Node 9: This node is not part of any 3-star as it is connected to only two nodes.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [11]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (2, 5, 6)>, <0, (2, 6, 7)>, <0, (2, 7, 8)>, <0, (5, 6, 8)>, <1, (6, 7, 8)>, <1, (6, 7, 9)>, <4, (2, 7, 6)>, <5, (0, 8, 9)>, <5, (8, 9, 1)>, <6, (0, 1, 7)>, <7, (0, 1, 6)>
