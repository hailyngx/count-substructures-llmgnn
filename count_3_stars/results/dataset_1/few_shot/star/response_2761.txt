Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node has exactly three neighbors forming a 3-star. Let's go step by step:

1. Nodes 0, 5, and 9 have 3 neighbors each, forming 3-stars:
   - <0, (1, 3, 5)>
   - <5, (0, 3, 7)>
   - <9, (1, 3, 4)>

2. Let's count the unique 3-stars found:
   - <0, (1, 3, 5)>
   - <5, (0, 3, 7)>
   - <9, (1, 3, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
