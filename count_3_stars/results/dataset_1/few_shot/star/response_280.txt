Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all the 3-stars present. 

Let's find the 3-stars:

In a 3-star graph, the center node is connected to exactly three other nodes. From the given adjacency list, we can identify the following unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<0, (4, 8, 9)>
<0, (5, 6, 8)>
<0, (8, 9, 1)>
<2, (3, 9, 0)>
<3, (2, 4, 0)>
<4, (0, 6, 7)>
<5, (0, 6, 7)>
<6, (4, 5, 7)>
<7, (4, 5, 6)>
<8, (0, 5, 6)>
<9, (0, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
