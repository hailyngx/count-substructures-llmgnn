Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for each node that has exactly 3 neighbors and consider it as the center of a 3-star graph. Here are the 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<1, (0, 2, 8)>
<2, (0, 1, 6)>
<3, (7, 9, None)>
<4, (0, 7, 8)>
<5, (0, 1, None)>
<6, (2, 8, 9)>
<7, (0, 3, 4)>
<8, (1, 2, 4)>
<9, (3, 6, 8)>

Therefore, there are a total of [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
