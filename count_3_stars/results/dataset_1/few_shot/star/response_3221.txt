Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 1

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the 3-stars by finding the nodes that form such structures. 

A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars present in the graph:

1. Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 7, and 8: <0, (5, 7, 8)>
2. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 7, and 9: <1, (5, 7, 9)>
3. Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 4, and 6: <3, (2, 4, 6)>
4. Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 8 and 7 (also counting node 3 as the center): <3, (7, 8, 3)>
5. Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, and 5: <7, (0, 1, 5)>
6. Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 6, and 7: <8, (0, 6, 7)>

Count of 3-stars in the graph: [6]
