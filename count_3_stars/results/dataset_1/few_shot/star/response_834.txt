Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all possible 3-stars. As per the definition, each 3-star has a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's analyze the graph:

From the adjacency list, we can see that the nodes that have exactly three neighbors are: 2, 3, 6, and 9. These nodes can be central nodes of the 3-stars.

Let's enumerate the unique 3-stars present in the graph:

<2, (3, 4, 8)>
<3, (2, 7, 8)>
<6, (4, 5, 8)>
<9, (0, 1, 4)>

Count of 3-stars in the given graph: [4]
