Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 6
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 3

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify all possible 3-star subgraphs. 

First, let's list all unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<1, (0, 6, 9)>
<2, (0, 3, 9)>
<3, (0, 2, 9)>
<6, (0, 1, 2)>
<7, (1, 3, 8)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars by counting the occurrences of each unique 3-star:

Occurrences:
- <0, (1, 2, 3)> occurs 1 time
- <1, (0, 6, 9)> occurs 1 time
- <2, (0, 3, 9)> occurs 1 time
- <3, (0, 2, 9)> occurs 1 time
- <6, (0, 1, 2)> occurs 1 time
- <7, (1, 3, 8)> occurs 1 time

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
