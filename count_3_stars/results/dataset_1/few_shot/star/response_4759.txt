Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 5

Response:
Based on the information provided, let's identify the 3-stars present in the graph:

<Node 0, (4, 5, 6)>
<Node 1, (2, 3, 8)>
<Node 2, (1, 3, 8)>
<Node 4, (0, 1, 9)>
<Node 5, (0, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
