Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 6) (3, 5) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that serves as the center of a 3-star. Since a 3-star has the center connected to exactly three other nodes, we can identify them based on the connectivity patterns. 

Here are the 3-stars found in the given graph:

[3]

<0, (8, 9)>
<1, (6, 7)>
<4, (5, 6, 7)>
<5, (3, 4, 6)>
<6, (1, 2, 4)>
<7, (1, 4, 9)>
<9, (0, 6, 7)>

Total number of 3-stars: [7]
