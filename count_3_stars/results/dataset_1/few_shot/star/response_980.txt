Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 3

Response:
The total number of 3-star graphs can be found by checking each node and its neighbors to see if they form a 3-star pattern. 

We will now list the unique 3-stars found in the graph: 
[<0, (5, 7, 1)>, <2, (3, 4, 9)>, <2, (4, 5, 7)>]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
