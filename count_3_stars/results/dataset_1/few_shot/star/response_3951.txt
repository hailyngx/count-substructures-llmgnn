Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes, which represents a 3-star with that node as the center.

Nodes 1, 5, and 6 are each connected to exactly three other nodes, forming 3-stars:
<1, (3, 5, 6)>
<5, (1, 6, 7)>
<6, (1, 2, 3)>

There are a total of [3] 3-stars in the given graph.
