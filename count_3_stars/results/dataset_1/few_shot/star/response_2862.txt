Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that has exactly three neighbors. Each such node will be the center of a 3-star. 

Based on the adjacency list provided, the nodes that have exactly three neighbors are:
- Node 0 with neighbors 1, 2, and 3
- Node 3 with neighbors 0, 1, and ??
- Node 6 with neighbors 1, 2, and ??

Let's find the missing neighbors of Node 3 and Node 6:
- Node 3 is missing neighbor 2.
- Node 6 is missing neighbor 4.

Therefore, the 3-stars in the given graph are:
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<6, (1, 2, 4)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
