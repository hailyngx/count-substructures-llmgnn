Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 8

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 

1. Node 1 can form a 3-star with nodes 2, 4, 8. So the 3-star is <1, (2, 4, 8)>.
2. Node 2 can form a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, 8. So the 3-star is <2, (1, 3, 8)>.
3. Node 3 can form a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, 2. So the 3-star is <3, (0, 1, 2)>.
4. Node 4 can form a 3-star with nodes 1, 8, 9. So the 3-star is <4, (1, 8, 9)>.
5. Node 8 can form a 3-star with nodes 1, 2, 4. So the 3-star is <8, (1, 2, 4)>.
6. Node 9 can form a 3-star with nodes 0, 4, 8. So the 3-star is <9, (0, 4, 8)>.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
