Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all possible 3-stars. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Given the adjacency list, we can see which nodes each node is connected to. We'll search for all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, which will form a 3-star.

Here are the 3-stars found in the graph:
<1, (0, 6, 8)>
<1, (2, 3, 9)>
<4, (6, 7, 9)>
<4, (6, 7, 8)>
<7, (4, 5, 8)>
<7, (5, 6, 8)>

Count of 3-stars: [6]
