Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's start by listing the 3-stars one by one:

<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<0, (3, 4, 8)>
<0, (3, 5, 8)>
<0, (4, 5, 8)>
<1, (2, 4, 7)>
<1, (2, 7, 8)>
<1, (4, 7, 9)>
<2, (1, 7, 8)>
<3, (0, 6, 8)>
<4, (0, 1, 2)>
<4, (0, 2, 8)>
<4, (1, 2, 7)>
<4, (1, 7, 8)>
<6, (3, 4, 7)>
<7, (1, 2, 4)>
<7, (1, 4, 8)>
<7, (2, 4, 8)>
<7, (4, 6, 8)>
<8, (0, 2, 3)>
<8, (0, 3, 5)>
<8, (0, 4, 5)>
<8, (2, 5, 7)>
<8, (3, 4, 6)>
<8, (4, 5, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [24].
