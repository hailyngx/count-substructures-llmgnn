Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star. 

Here are the unique 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (5, 7, 8)>
<0, (5, 7, 9)>
<0, (5, 8, 9)>
<0, (7, 8, 9)>
<2, (5, 7, 9)>
<2, (5, 8, 9)>
<2, (7, 8, 9)>
<6, (1, 4, 7)>
<6, (1, 2, 7)>
<6, (1, 2, 4)>
<6, (1, 2, 6)>
<6, (2, 4, 7)>
<6, (2, 4, 9)>
<6, (2, 6, 7)>
<6, (2, 6, 9)>
<6, (4, 6, 7)>
<6, (4, 6, 9)>
<6, (6, 7, 9)>
<7, (0, 5, 9)>
<7, (0, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 5, 9)>
<8, (0, 7, 9)>
<9, (0, 5, 7)>
<9, (0, 5, 8)>
<9, (0, 7, 8)>

Count of 3-stars: [25]
