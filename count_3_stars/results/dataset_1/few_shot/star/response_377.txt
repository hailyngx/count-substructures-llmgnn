Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 5

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that can act as the center of a 3-star in this graph. 
Nodes with exactly three neighbors can be the centers of a 3-star.
From the given information, nodes 2 and 4 have less than three neighbors, so they cannot be the center. 

Nodes 0, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 9 have exactly three neighbors, so each of these nodes can be the center of a 3-star. 

Now, let's list the 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<0, (1, 5, 9)>
<0, (3, 5, 9)>
<0, (5, 6, 9)>
<3, (0, 2, 4)>
<3, (0, 4, 7)>
<3, (2, 4, 7)>
<5, (0, 6, 8)>
<5, (0, 8, 9)>
<5, (6, 8, 9)>
<6, (0, 5, 9)>
<7, (0, 1, 3)>
<7, (1, 3, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 5)>
