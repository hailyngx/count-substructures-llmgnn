Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to first identify the 3-stars present. A 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three leaf nodes.

We can identify the 3-stars in this graph by examining each node and its neighbors. A node will form a 3-star if it has exactly 3 neighbors and those neighbors are not connected to each other (excluding the center node). Let's list the unique 3-stars found in this graph:

<1, (4, 6, 9)>
<3, (5, 7, 9)>

Now, count the total number of 3-stars.[
    There are 2 unique 3-stars found in the given graph, so the total number of 3-stars is [2].
