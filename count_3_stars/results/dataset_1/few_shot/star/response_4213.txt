Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 6) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars, we should look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

1. Nodes connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 6, 2, and 3.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 6, 1, and 3.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 6, 1, and 2.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 9. 

Therefore, there are 3 unique 3-stars in this graph. 

Thus, the final answer is: [3]

Unique 3-stars found:
<1, (6, 2, 3)>
<2, (6, 1, 3)>
<7, (4, 6, 9)>
