Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's begin by examining each node and its connections to find the 3-stars:

1. Node 0: Not part of any 3-star.
2. Node 1: Forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 7, and 8. <1, (5, 7, 8)>
3. Node 2: Forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 4, and 5. <2, (3, 4, 5)>
4. Node 3: Not part of any 3-star.
5. Node 4: Forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 2, and 9. <4, (0, 2, 9)>
6. Node 5: Forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 2, and 7. <5, (1, 2, 7)>
7. Node 6: Not part of any 3-star.
8. Node 7: Forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, and 5. <7, (1, 3, 5)>
9. Node 8: Forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 9, and 2. <8, (1, 9, 2)>
10. Node 9: Forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 4, and 6. <9, (2, 4, 6)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].  
The unique 3-stars found are: <1, (5, 7, 8)>, <2, (3, 4, 5)>, <4, (0, 2, 9)>, <5, (1, 2, 7)>, <7, (1, 3, 5)>, <8, (1, 9, 2)>.
