Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that have exactly 3 neighbors and form a 3-star centered at that node. Since a 3-star graph consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we need to identify such structures in the graph.

Here are the steps to find the 3-stars in the given graph:
1. Identify nodes with exactly 3 neighbors.
2. Check if these nodes form valid 3-star structures.
3. Count the total number of unique 3-stars.

Let's start by listing the nodes that can potentially be the center of a 3-star based on having exactly 3 neighbors:
- Nodes 0, 1, 5, 8

Next, we will examine each of these nodes to determine if they form valid 3-star structures. Let's analyze each node:

1. Node 0:
   - Neighbors: 3, 4
   - Forms a 3-star: <0, (3, 4)>

2. Node 1:
   - Neighbors: 7
   - Does not form a 3-star.

3. Node 5:
   - Neighbor: 6
   - Does not form a 3-star.

4. Node 8:
   - Neighbors: 2, 4
   - Does not form a 3-star.

Based on the analysis, the unique 3-star structure found is <0, (3, 4)>. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1].
