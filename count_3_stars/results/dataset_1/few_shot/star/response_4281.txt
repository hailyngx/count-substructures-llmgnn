Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a star shape.

Let's list down the 3-stars:
<0, (1, 2, 8)>
<2, (0, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 2, 4)>
<4, (6, 8, 8)>
<9, (2, 5, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [5].
