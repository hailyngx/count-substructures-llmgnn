Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 8

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars. 

Let's list them step by step:
1. For node 0:
   - <0, (2, 4, 6)>
   - <0, (4, 7, 8)>
   - <0, (4, 8, 9)>

2. For node 1:
   - <1, (2, 3, 4)>
   - <1, (1, 8, 9)>

3. For node 2:
   - No 3-stars as it only has two neighbors.

4. For node 3:
   - No 3-stars as it only has two neighbors.

5. For node 4:
   - <4, (0, 7, 8)>
   - <4, (1, 7, 8)>
   - <4, (0, 8, 9)>

6. For node 5:
   - No 3-stars as it only has two neighbors.

7. For node 6:
   - No 3-stars as it only has two neighbors.

8. For node 7:
   - No 3-stars as it only has one neighbor.

9. For node 8:
   - <8, (0, 5, 9)>
   - <8, (1, 4, 9)>
   - <8, (1, 5, 9)>
   - <8, (4, 5, 9)>

10. For node 9:
    - No 3-stars as it only has two neighbors.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [11]. 
The unique 3-stars are <0, (2, 4, 6)>, <0, (4, 7, 8)>, <0, (4, 8, 9)>, <1, (2, 3, 4)>, <1, (1, 8, 9)>, <4, (0, 7, 8)>, <4, (1, 7, 8)>, <4, (0, 8, 9)>, <8, (0, 5, 9)>, <8, (1, 4, 9)>, and <8, (1, 5, 9)>.
