Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 4, 7, and node 8

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (1, 2, 7)>
2. <0, (1, 5, 7)>
3. <1, (0, 9, 7)>
4. <2, (0, 3, 5)>
5. <3, (2, 5, 6)>
6. <4, (6, 8, 9)>
7. <5, (0, 3, 6)>
8. <7, (0, 6, 9)>
9. <9, (1, 4, 8)>

[Total number of 3-stars: [9]]
