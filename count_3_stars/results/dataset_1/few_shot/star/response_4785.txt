Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 7

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we can identify each valid 3-star by selecting a central node and then finding its neighbors which are connected to exactly two other nodes (since it's a 3-star graph).

Let's go through the nodes one by one:
1. Node 0: (0, 2, 5), (0, 2, 9), (0, 3, 5), (0, 3, 9), (0, 5, 2), (0, 5, 9), (0, 9, 2), (0, 2, 5) - <0, (2, 5, 9)>
2. Node 1: Not connected to any other nodes, so no 3-stars.
3. Node 2: (2, 0, 5), (2, 0, 9), (2, 5, 0), (2, 5, 9), (2, 6, 0), (2, 9, 0) - <2, (0, 5, 9)>, <2, (5, 0, 9)>
4. Node 3: (3, 0, 4) - <3, (0, 4, 3)>
5. Node 4: (4, 3, 7) - <4, (3, 7, 4)>
6. Node 5: (5, 0, 2), (5, 0, 9), (5, 2, 0), (5, 2, 9) - <5, (0, 2, 9)>, <5, (2, 0, 9)>
7. Node 6: No 3-stars.
8. Node 7: (7, 4, 3), (7, 4, 8), (7, 9, 0) - <7, (4, 3, 7)>
9. Node 8: No 3-stars.
10. Node 9: (9, 0, 2), (9, 0, 7), (9, 2, 0), (9, 7, 0) - <9, (0, 2, 7)>, <9, (2, 0, 7)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6]. 
The unique 3-stars are <0, (2, 5, 9)>, <2, (0, 5, 9)>, <2, (5, 0, 9)>, <3, (0, 4, 3)>, <4, (3, 7, 4)>, <7, (4, 3, 7)>.
