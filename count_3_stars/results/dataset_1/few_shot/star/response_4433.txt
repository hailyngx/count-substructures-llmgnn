Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's analyze the connectivity of each node:

- Node 0: Not a part of any 3-star as it is connected to 2 nodes only.
- Node 1: Forms a 3-star with (0, 5) and (3, 4, 6).
- Node 2: Not a part of any 3-star as it is connected to 1 node only.
- Node 3: Forms a 3-star with (1, 5) and (8, 9, 6).
- Node 4: Not a part of any 3-star as it is connected to 1 node only.
- Node 5: Not a part of any 3-star as it is connected to 3 nodes only.
- Node 6: Forms 3-stars with (1, 3) and (8, 9, 7).
- Node 7: Not a part of any 3-star as it is connected to 1 node only.
- Node 8: Not a part of any 3-star as it is connected to 3 nodes only.
- Node 9: Not a part of any 3-star as it is connected to 3 nodes only.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].

Unique 3-stars: 
<0, (1, 5)>
<1, (3, 4, 6)>
<3, (1, 5)>
<6, (1, 3)>
