Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Here are the steps to find and count the 3-stars:

1. Identify nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
   - Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and 8.
   - Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and 8.
   - Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and 9.

2. List the unique 3-stars:
   - <1, (2, 3, 4)>
   - <3, (1, 2, 8)>
   - <4, (1, 3, 5)>

3. Count the number of unique 3-stars listed: 
   - [3] 

Therefore, there are 3 unique 3-stars in the given graph. [3]
