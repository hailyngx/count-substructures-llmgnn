Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 2) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 2
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 1

Response:
The central node in a 3-star graph will be connected to exactly three other nodes. 
After examining the provided graph, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (1, 3, 6)>
<0, (1, 7, 9)>
<0, (6, 7, 9)>
<1, (0, 2, 9)>
<3, (0, 7, -)>
<6, (0, 8, -)>
<7, (0, 3, 8)>
<8, (6, 7, -)>
<9, (0, 1, -)>
