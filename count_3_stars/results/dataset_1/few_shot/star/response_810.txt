Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all the occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a star pattern.

In this graph:
- Node 1 forms 3-stars with nodes 2, 4, 7, and 9. So, there are 4 different 3-stars involving node 1: <1, (2, 4, 7)>, <1, (2, 4, 9)>, <1, (2, 7, 9)>, <1, (4, 7, 9)>
- Node 2 forms 3-star with nodes 1, 8, and 9: <2, (1, 8, 9)>
- Node 4 forms 3-star with nodes 1, 5, and 7: <4, (1, 5, 7)>
- Node 5 forms 3-star with nodes 0, 4, and 7: <5, (0, 4, 7)>
- Node 8 forms 3-star with nodes 2, 3, and 9: <8, (2, 3, 9)>
- Node 9 forms 3-stars with nodes 1, 6, and 8. So, there are 2 different 3-stars involving node 9: <9, (1, 6, 8)>, <9, (1, 8, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
<1, (2, 4, 7)>, <1, (2, 4, 9)>, <1, (2, 7, 9)>, <1, (4, 7, 9)>, <2, (1, 8, 9)>, <4, (1, 5, 7)>, <5, (0, 4, 7)>, <8, (2, 3, 9)>
