Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 5

Response:
There are 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<0, (3, 5, 7)>
<0, (4, 5, 9)>
<5, (0, 3, 4)>
<5, (0, 3, 9)>
<7, (0, 1, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
