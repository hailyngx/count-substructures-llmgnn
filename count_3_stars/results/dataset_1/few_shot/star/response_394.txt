Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 2

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Upon examining the adjacency list and the edges provided, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (4, 7, 2)>
<1, (5, 9, 2)>
<2, (3, 7, 9)>
<3, (2, 8, 7)>
<5, (1, 7, 8)>
<7, (0, 5, 8)>
<8, (3, 5, 7)>
<9, (1, 2, 0)>

Count of 3-stars: [8]
