Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we look for nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them. These nodes will act as the centers of the 3-stars. 

Here are the 3-stars found in the given graph:
<0, (6, 9)>
<2, (1, 7, 9)>
<4, (5, 9)>
<5, (4, 7)>
<7, (2, 5, 8)>
<9, (0, 2, 4)>

There are a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
