Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 7

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, and 4.
2. Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 5, and 8.
3. Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 7, and 8.
4. Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 8, and 9.

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the given graph. 

[4]

Therefore, the answer is [4].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<2, (4, 5, 8)>
<6, (5, 7, 8)>
<7, (6, 8, 9)>
