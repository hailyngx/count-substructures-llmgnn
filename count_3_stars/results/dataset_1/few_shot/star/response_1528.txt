Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 1

Response:
Let's first identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
1. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 8, and 9: <1, (0, 8, 9)>
2. Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 6, and 7: <4, (1, 6, 7)>
3. Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 4, and another occurrence of 1: <8, (1, 4, 1)>
4. Node 9 forms a 3-star with node 1 and two unconnected nodes: <9, (1, 2, 5)>

Count of 3-stars: [4]
