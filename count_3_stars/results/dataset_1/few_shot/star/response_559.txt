Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 5

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<1, (5, 7, -)>
<2, (6, 8, -)>
<3, (0, 8, -)>
<4, (6, 7, 9)>
<5, (0, 1, 6)>
<6, (0, 2, 4)>
<7, (1, 4, 5)>
<8, (2, 3, -)>
<9, (4, 5, -)>

Counting the unique 3-stars gives us a total of [9].
