Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (4, 2) (6, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 6
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 2
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for sets of nodes that form the structure of a 3-star. As per the definition given, a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Looking at the graph and the given adjacency list, we can identify the 3-stars as follows:

<0, (1, 2, 8)>
<1, (0, 2, 8)>
<2, (0, 1, 4)>
<2, (0, 1, 6)>
<8, (0, 1, 9)>
<9, (7, 8)>
