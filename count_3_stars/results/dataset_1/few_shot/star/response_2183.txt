Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's go step by step:

1. Identify all nodes that are part of a 3-star pattern:
   - Node 0 is part of the 3-star: <0, (3, 7, 9)>
   - Node 3 is part of the 3-star: <3, (0, 8, 9)>
   - Node 4 is part of the 3-star: <4, (1, 5, 9)>
   - Node 6 is part of the 3-star: <6, (4, 7, 9)>
   - Node 8 is part of the 3-star: <8, (1, 5, 7)>

2. Count the total number of unique 3-stars found:
   - There are 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
