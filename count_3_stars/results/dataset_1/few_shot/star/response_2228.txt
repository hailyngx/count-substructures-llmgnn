Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 3

Response:
Step 1: Identify 3-stars in the graph.
- Start by identifying nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes forming 3-stars.
- Let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<2, (1, 4, 7)>

Step 2: Count the number of unique 3-stars.
- Since we found 2 unique 3-stars, the final answer is [2].
