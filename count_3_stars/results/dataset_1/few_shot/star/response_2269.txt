Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes of the 3-stars in the graph. Since a 3-star has a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we will look for nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them.

The nodes with exactly three edges connected to them are:
- Node 1 (connected to nodes 2, 3, 5)
- Node 3 (connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, 6, 7)
- Node 6 (connected to nodes 3, 5)

Now, let's enumerate the 3-stars in the graph:
<1, (2, 3, 5)>
<3, (1, 2, 4)>
<3, (1, 2, 6)>
<3, (4, 6, 7)>
<6, (1, 3, 5)>

Count of 3-stars: [5]
Unique 3-stars: <1, (2, 3, 5)>, <3, (1, 2, 4)>, <3, (1, 2, 6)>, <3, (4, 6, 7)>, <6, (1, 3, 5)>
