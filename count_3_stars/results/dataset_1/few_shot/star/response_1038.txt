Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 6

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph can be determined by counting the number of times a node has exactly three neighbors. Let's find the 3-stars:

<1, (5, 6, 9)>
<4, (5, 6, 8)>
<5, (1, 4, 8)>
<6, (1, 4, 9)>
