Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 4) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 3
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star-like pattern. 

Based on the given information, we can identify the following 3-stars:

<0, (1, 4, 8)>
<1, (0, 4, 8)>
<3, (4, 5, 8)>
<4, (0, 1, 3)>
<4, (0, 1, 8)>
<4, (0, 3, 8)>
<4, (1, 3, 8)>

Count of 3-stars: 7

Therefore, the final answer is [7].
