Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that satisfy the definition of a 3-star. 
Since a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can iterate through each node and check its neighbors to see if they form a 3-star centered at that node.

Here are the 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<0, (2, 5, 7)>
<0, (4, 5, 7)>
<3, (1, 5, 8)>
<3, (5, 6, 8)>
<5, (0, 3, 7)>
<5, (3, 4, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
