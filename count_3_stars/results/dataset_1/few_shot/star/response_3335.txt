Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 6

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with leaves 3, 7, and 9: <1, (3, 7, 9)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with leaves 4, 6, and 9: <2, (4, 6, 9)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with leaves 2, 5, and 7: <6, (2, 5, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
