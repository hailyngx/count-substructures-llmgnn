Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 6, and node 7

Response:
Given the graph information, let's identify the 3-stars:

1. Node 0: <0, (2, 3, 9)>
2. Node 2: <2, (0, 8, 9)>
3. Node 3: <3, (0, 5, 9)>
4. Node 5: <5, (1, 3, 6)>
5. Node 6: <6, (4, 5, 9)>
6. Node 9: <9, (0, 2, 3)>
7. Node 9: <9, (6, 7, 0)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
