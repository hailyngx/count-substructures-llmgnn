Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 44 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 5

Response:
In this graph, the 3-star configurations can be identified by looking at nodes that are connected to exactly 3 other nodes through edges. 

Nodes that are connected to exactly 3 other nodes:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 4
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 8
- Node 9 is connected to node 1, 5

Therefore, there are 3 unique 3-stars in the given graph: <0, (1, 2, 4)>, <7, (3, 5, 8)>, <9, (1, 5)>. 

Finally, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is counted to be [3].
