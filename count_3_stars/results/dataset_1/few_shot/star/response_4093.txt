Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 7

Response:
First, we identify the 3-stars based on the definition provided.

Node 0 is not part of any 3-star since it has only 2 edges.
Node 1 is not part of any 3-star since it has 3 edges.
Node 2 is part of one 3-star: <2, (4, 5, 8)>.
Node 3 is not part of any 3-star since it has only 1 edge.
Node 4 is part of three 3-stars: <4, (2, 5, 8)>, <4, (3, 5, 6)>, <4, (6, 5, 8)>.
Node 5 is part of two 3-stars: <5, (0, 4, 6)>, <5, (2, 4, 7)>.
Node 6 is not part of any 3-star since it has 4 edges.
Node 7 is not part of any 3-star since it has 3 edges.
Node 8 is not part of any 3-star since it has 3 edges.
Node 9 is not part of any 3-star since it has 2 edges.

Therefore, there are a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph.  
The unique 3-stars are: 
<2, (4, 5, 8)>
<4, (2, 5, 8)>
<4, (3, 5, 6)>
<4, (6, 5, 8)>
<5, (0, 4, 6)>
<5, (2, 4, 7)>
