Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify every 3-star configuration. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

By examining the adjacency list, we can identify each 3-star by looking at the nodes connected to a particular node.

There are 4 unique 3-stars in the provided graph. Here they are:

<2, (3, 4, 9)>
<4, (2, 5, 8)>
<6, (0, 1, 8)>
<7, (1, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
