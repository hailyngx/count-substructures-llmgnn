Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star by finding all occurrences of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's determine the 3-stars in this graph step-by-step:

1. Calculate the degree of each node:
- Node 0: Degree = 3
- Node 1: Degree = 1
- Node 2: Degree = 3
- Node 3: Degree = 0
- Node 4: Degree = 2
- Node 5: Degree = 4
- Node 6: Degree = 4
- Node 7: Degree = 4
- Node 8: Degree = 2
- Node 9: Degree = 5

2. Identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 is the central node of the 3-star: <0, (5, 7, 9)>
- Node 2 is the central node of the 3-star: <2, (6, 7, 9)>
- Node 5 is the central node of the 3-star: <5, (0, 4, 9)>
- Node 6 is the central node of the 3-star: <6, (2, 4, 9)>
- Node 7 is the central node of the 3-star: <7, (0, 2, 8)>
- Node 9 is the central node of the 3-star: <9, (0, 5, 6)>

3. Count the total number of unique 3-stars: [5]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
