Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 8

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph. 

Looking at the graph structure, we see that nodes 1, 7, and 5 can be central nodes for 3-star graphs. Let's count the number of 3-star graphs for each central node:
1. Node 1: (0, 1, 4), (0, 1, 5), (0, 1, 7), (4, 1, 5), (4, 1, 6), (5, 1, 7), (7, 1, 3), (7, 1, 5), and (7, 1, 8) -> Total: 9
2. Node 7: (1, 7, 5), (3, 7, 5), (4, 7, 5), (5, 7, 6) -> Total: 4
3. Node 5: (1, 5, 2), (1, 5, 4), (2, 5, 6), (4, 5, 6), (5, 7, 6) -> Total: 5

Counting all the unique 3-star graphs, we get an answer of [18].

Unique 3-stars: 
<0, (1, 4, 5)>, <0, (1, 5, 7)>, <4, (1, 5, 6)>, <5, (1, 7, 3)>, <5, (1, 7, 8)>, <5, (1, 2, 6)>, <6, (2, 4, 7)>, <7, (3, 5, 1)>, <7, (3, 5, 6)>, <7, (1, 5, 6)>, <7, (1, 5, 4)>, <5, (2, 6, 1)>, <9, (8, 0, 1)>, <5, (7, 1, 3)>, <5, (7, 1, 8)>, <6, (7, 4, 2)>, <7, (5, 4, 6)>, <6, (5, 2, 4)>
