Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (3, 5) (3, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 8

Response:
Given the graph information, we can identify the 3-star subgraphs by looking for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a "star" around a central node. Let's find these 3-stars step by step.

1. Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 5, and 7:
<0, (1, 5, 7)>

2. Node 1 does not form a 3-star as it is connected to only two nodes.

3. Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 6, and 7:
<3, (5, 6, 7)>

4. Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 3, and 6:
<5, (0, 3, 6)>

5. Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 5, and 7:
<6, (1, 5, 7)>

6. Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 3, and 6:
<7, (0, 3, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
