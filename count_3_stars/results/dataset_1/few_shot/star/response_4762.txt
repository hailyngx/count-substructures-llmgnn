Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes as a central node of a 3-star pattern.

Based on the provided information, we can see that the only nodes that meet this criteria are nodes 0, 3, and 7, as they each have degree 3 and are connected to exactly three other nodes.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 3. 

[3]

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (2, 5, 7)>
<3, (6, 8, 9)>
<7, (0, 1, 8)>
