Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star pattern in the graph.

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<3, (0, 6, 8)>
<5, (0, 7, 8)>
<6, (0, 2, 7)>

Count of 3-stars: [6]
