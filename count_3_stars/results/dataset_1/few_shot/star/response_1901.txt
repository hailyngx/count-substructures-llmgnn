Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are as follows:

<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<1, (0, 2, 8)>
<2, (1, 7, 8)>
<3, (4, 5, 8)>
<4, (3, 5, 9)>
<5, (0, 3, 8)>
<7, (2, 9, 1)>
<9, (1, 3, 7)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
