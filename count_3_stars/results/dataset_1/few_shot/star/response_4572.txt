Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 7) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 7
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node has exactly three neighbors forming a 3-star around it.

Looking at the adjacency list for each node:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors (1, 5, 6, 8, 9) but doesn't form a 3-star.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors (0, 4, 5, 7) and forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 5, and 6.
- Node 2 has 1 neighbor (7) and doesn't form a 3-star.
- Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors (1, 5, 8) and forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 5, and 8.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors (0, 1, 4) and forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, and 4.
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors (0, 9) and doesn't form a 3-star.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors (1, 2, 8) and forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 2, and 8.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors (0, 4, 7) and forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 4, and 7.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors (0, 6) and doesn't form a 3-star.

Therefore, the 3-stars in the given graph are: 
<1, (0, 5, 6)>
<4, (1, 5, 8)>
<5, (0, 1, 4)>
<7, (1, 2, 8)>
<8, (0, 4, 7)>

Count of 3-stars: [5]
