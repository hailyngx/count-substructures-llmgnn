Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 4, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the subgraphs where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we can see the possible 3-stars in the graph. Let's list them:
1. <0, (1, 2, 3)>
2. <0, (1, 3, 4)>
3. <1, (0, 3, 7)>
4. <1, (0, 3, 8)>
5. <1, (0, 3, 9)>
6. <2, (0, 3, 4)>
7. <3, (0, 1, 2)>
8. <3, (0, 1, 4)>
9. <4, (0, 2, 3)>
10. <4, (0, 2, 7)>
11. <4, (0, 2, 8)>
12. <7, (1, 4, 6)>
13. <8, (1, 4, 6)>
14. <9, (1, 5, 6)>
15. <9, (1, 5, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].
