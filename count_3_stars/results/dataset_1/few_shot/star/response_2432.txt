Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 4, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 4

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes of potential 3-stars. The center nodes must have a degree equal to 3 in order to form a 3-star. 

From the given adjacency list:
- Node 1, 7, and 9 do not have a degree of 3.
- Node 0, 2, 4, and 5 have a degree of 6.
- Node 3 and 8 have a degree of 4.
- Node 6 has a degree of 3.

Therefore, the potential center nodes for 3-stars are node 0, 2, 4, 5, and 6.

Next, let's check the neighbors of each potential center node to determine the 3-stars:
- For node 0: (2, 4, 5), (2, 5, 9), (4, 5, 9), (5, 6, 1), (5, 6, 3), (5, 6, 7)
- For node 2: (0, 4, 5), (0, 5, 6)
- For node 4: (0, 2, 5), (0, 5, 6), (0, 5, 9)
- For node 5: (0, 1, 2), (0, 2, 4), (0, 4, 6), (0, 6, 7)
- For node 6: (0, 3, 8)

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are:
<0, (2, 4, 5)>, <0, (2, 5, 9)>, <0, (4, 5, 9)>, <0, (5, 6, 1)>, <0, (5, 6, 3)>, <0, (5, 6, 7)>, <2, (0, 4, 5)>, <2, (0, 5, 6)>, <4, (0, 2, 5)>, <4, (0, 5, 6)>, <4, (0, 5, 9)>, <5, (0, 1, 2)>, <5, (0, 2, 4)>, <5, (0, 4, 6)>, <5, (0, 6, 7)>, <6, (0, 3, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].
