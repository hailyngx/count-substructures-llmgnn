Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, 7, and node 8

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be determined by finding all combinations of 3 nodes that are connected to a common center node. We can identify the 3-star patterns by looking at the adjacency list of each node to see which nodes are connected to it.

Based on the given information, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<1, (2, 4, 9)>
<2, (1, 3, 5)>
<3, (0, 2, 7)>
<4, (1, 2, 8)>
<5, (2, 9)>
<7, (3, 8, 9)>
<8, (4, 7, 9)>
<9, (1, 3, 5, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
