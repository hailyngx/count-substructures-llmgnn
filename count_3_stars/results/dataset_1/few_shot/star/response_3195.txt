Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 9) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 9
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 9
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star structure.

Looking at the adjacency list, we see that the nodes connected to exactly three other nodes are:
- Node 0 (connected to nodes 2, 3, 9)
- Node 2 (connected to nodes 0, 7, 8)
- Node 3 (connected to nodes 0, 6, 8)
- Node 8 (connected to nodes 2, 3, 9)
- Node 9 (connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 4)

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars present in the graph:

There are three unique 3-star structures:
<0, (2, 3, 9)>
<2, (0, 8, 9)>
<3, (0, 6, 8)>
<8, (2, 3, 9)>
<9, (0, 2, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5]. 
This is because there are five unique 3-star structures as listed above.
