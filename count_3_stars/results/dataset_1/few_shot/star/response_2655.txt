Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible 3-stars. A 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three leaf nodes.

Let's first list the 3-stars in the given graph:
<0, (8, 9)>
<1, (2, 3, 4)>
<1, (3, 4, 6)>
<1, (4, 5, 7)>
<1, (6, 2, 7)>
<3, (1, 6, 8)>
<8, (0, 3, 6)>
<4, (1, 9, 5)>
<9, (0, 4, 5)>

Count of 3-stars: [9]
