Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 6

Response:
Given the information provided, we need to identify all the 3-stars in the graph.

Based on the definition of a 3-star graph, each 3-star consists of a central node connected to three other nodes. We will look at each node and see if it is the center of a 3-star.

Let's start with the nodes:
- Node 0: <0, (2, 4, 7)>
- Node 1: <1, (2, 6, 7)>
- Node 2: <2, (0, 1, 7)>
- Node 3: Not a center of a 3-star.
- Node 4: <4, (0, 6, 9)>
- Node 5: Not connected to any other nodes.
- Node 6: <6, (1, 3, 4)>
- Node 7: <7, (0, 1, 2)>
- Node 8: Not a center of a 3-star.
- Node 9: <9, (0, 1, 6)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7]. 
The unique 3-stars found are <0, (2, 4, 7)>, <1, (2, 6, 7)>, <2, (0, 1, 7)>, <4, (0, 6, 9)>, <6, (1, 3, 4)>, <7, (0, 1, 2)>, <9, (0, 1, 6)>.
