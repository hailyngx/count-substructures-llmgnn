Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 8

Response:
Let's start by finding the 3-stars in the given graph step-by-step.

1. Identify the possible central nodes:
   - Node 1, Node 4, Node 6, and Node 9 are the potential central nodes as they have exactly 3 neighbors.

2. Identify the 3-stars:
   - For Node 1: (1, 0, 3, 7), (1, 3, 6, 9) -> 2 3-stars
   - For Node 4: (4, 2, 5, 7) -> 1 3-star
   - For Node 6: (6, 3, 5, 7), (6, 5, 7, 9) -> 2 3-stars
   - For Node 9: (9, 1, 6, 8) -> 1 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: <1, (0, 3, 7)>, <1, (3, 6, 9)>, <4, (2, 5, 7)>, <6, (3, 5, 7)>, <6, (5, 7, 9)>, <9, (1, 6, 8)>.
