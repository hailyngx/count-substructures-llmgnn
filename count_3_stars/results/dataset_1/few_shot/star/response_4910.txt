Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star, which consists of a center node and three leaves that are connected to the center.

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (2, 4, 9)>
<1, (8, 9, 5)>
<2, (0, 5, 7)>
<5, (2, 8, 9)>
<5, (3, 6, 8)>
<5, (6, 9, 0)>
<6, (3, 5, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
