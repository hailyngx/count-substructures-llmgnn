Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 4
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star pattern. 
Let's go through the adjacency list of each node to find the 3-stars:

- Node 0: Not a part of any 3-stars.
- Node 1: Not a part of any 3-stars.
- Node 2: Not a part of any 3-stars.
- Node 3: Possible 3-star <3, (5, 6, 8)>
- Node 4: Possible 3-star <4, (1, 5, 8)>
- Node 5: Possible 3-star <5, (3, 4, 8)>
- Node 6: Possible 3-star <6, (3, 9, 9)>
- Node 7: Not a part of any 3-stars.
- Node 8: Possible 3-star <8, (3, 4, 5)>
- Node 9: Possible 3-star <9, (4, 5, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
Unique 3-stars: 
<3, (5, 6, 8)>, <4, (1, 5, 8)>, <5, (3, 4, 8)>, <6, (3, 9, 9)>, <8, (3, 4, 5)>, <9, (4, 5, 6)>
