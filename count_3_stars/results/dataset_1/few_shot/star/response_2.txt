Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 7, and node 8

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the unique sets of nodes that form a 3-star. 

In a 3-star, one node (the center) is connected to three other nodes (leaves). We will iterate through each node and check if it satisfies this condition. Once we identify a 3-star, we will list it as <center, (leaf1, leaf2, leaf3)>.

Here are the 3-stars in the given graph:
<1, (3, 5, 6)>
<2, (3, 4, 6)>
<3, (1, 2, 5)>
<4, (2, 7, 8)>
<5, (1, 3, 6)>
<6, (1, 2, 5)>
<7, (4, 5, 8)>
<8, (4, 5, 6)>
<9, (7, 8, 0)>

Count of 3-stars: [9]
