Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern.

Looking at the adjacency list, we can determine the possible 3-stars:

<1, (2, 6, 7)>
<2, (1, 9, 3)>
<3, (4, 6, 9)>
<4, (3, 6, 9)>
<6, (1, 3, 4)>
<9, (1, 2, 3)>

So, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
