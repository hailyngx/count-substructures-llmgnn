Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for each node that has exactly three neighbors and count those as 3-stars. 

Based on the description of the graph, the nodes that have exactly three neighbors are: 

- Node 1: (1, 3) (1 is the center, and 3 is the only leaf)
- Node 2: (2, 0, 4, 8)
- Node 5: (5, 4, 7, 8)
- Node 7: (7, 4, 5, 9)
- Node 9: (9, 3, 7)

Therefore, there are a total of 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph.
