Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 3

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph. 

From the given edges and adjacency list, we can see that the 3-stars in this graph are:
<0, (6, 8, 9)>
<1, (2, 3, 8)>
<2, (1, 3, 8)>
<3, (1, 2, 8)>
<8, (0, 1, 2)>
<8, (1, 2, 3)>
<8, (2, 3, 5)>
<8, (3, 1, 9)>
<8, (5, 2, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
