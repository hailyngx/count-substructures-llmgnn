Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 5

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify nodes that have exactly 3 neighbors and then check if these neighbors form a 3-star with the node.

Nodes with exactly 3 neighbors:
- Node 0 has 1 neighbor
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors
- Node 8 has 1 neighbor

Nodes with exactly 3 neighbors are: 1, 6, 7, and 9.

Let's check each of these nodes to see if they form 3-stars:
- Node 1: (1, 5, 9), (1, 6, 7) [<1, (5, 9)>, <1, (6, 7)>]
- Node 6: (6, 1, 7), (6, 2, 4) [<6, (1, 7)>, <6, (2, 4)>]
- Node 7: (7, 1, 6) [<7, (1, 6)>]
- Node 9: (9, 1, 5), (9, 3, 5) [<9, (1, 5)>, <9, (3, 5)>]

Count of 3-stars in the given graph: [5]
