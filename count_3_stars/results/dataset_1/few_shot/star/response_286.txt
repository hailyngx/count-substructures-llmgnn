Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 6

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph.

From the adjacency list:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 5, and 6: <0, (1, 5, 6)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 4, and 5: <1, (0, 4, 5)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 6, and 8: <4, (1, 6, 8)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, and 2: <5, (0, 1, 2)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 3, and 4: <6, (0, 3, 4)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 6, and 1: <9, (4, 6, 1)>

Count of 3-star graphs: [6]
Unique 3-stars: <0, (1, 5, 6)>, <1, (0, 4, 5)>, <4, (1, 6, 8)>, <5, (0, 1, 2)>, <6, (0, 3, 4)>, <9, (4, 6, 1)>
