Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 1) (3, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 7

Response:
Let's find the number of 3-stars in the given graph: 

[4]

Unique 3-stars: 
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<1, (0, 5, 8)>
<1, (2, 0, 3)>
<1, (3, 0, 2)>
