Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a star pattern. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Identify the central node and the leaf nodes:
   
    Central Node: Node 0
   
    Leaf Nodes: Nodes 1, 2, 6, 7, 8

2. Count the number of 3-stars:
   
    3-star with central node 0:
    <0, (1, 2, 6)>
   
    3-star with central node 2 and its adjacent nodes:
    <2, (0, 1, 5)>
    <2, (0, 3, 6)>
   
    3-star with central node 6 and its adjacent nodes:
    <6, (0, 2, 4)>
    <6, (0, 4, 7)>
   
    3-star with central node 7:
    <7, (0, 3, 5)>
    <7, (0, 4, 6)>
    <7, (0, 5, 8)>

3. Count the total number of unique 3-stars found: [7]
