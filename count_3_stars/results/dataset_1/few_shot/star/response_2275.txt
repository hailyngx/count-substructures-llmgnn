Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 4, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars present based on the provided edges and adjacency list.

Given the definition of a 3-star graph as having a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can see that the central node of a 3-star should have degree 3 and the other three leaves should have degree 1.

Let's go through the nodes to identify 3-stars:

1. Node 0 -> Degree: 1, Not a central node of a 3-star.
2. Node 1 -> Degree: 2, Not a central node of a 3-star.
3. Node 2 -> Degree: 4, Not a central node of a 3-star.
4. Node 3 -> Degree: 3, Possible central node of a 3-star. (1, 2, 5) forms a 3-star.
5. Node 4 -> Degree: 1, Not a central node of a 3-star.
6. Node 5 -> Degree: 2, Not a central node of a 3-star.
7. Node 6 -> Degree: 2, Not a central node of a 3-star.
8. Node 7 -> Degree: 0, Not a central node of a 3-star.
9. Node 8 -> Degree: 2, Not a central node of a 3-star.
10. Node 9 -> Degree: 5, Not a central node of a 3-star.

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1].

<3, (1, 2, 5)>
