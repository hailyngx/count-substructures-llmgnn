Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will form the centers of the 3-stars. Let's identify the 3-stars:

Since the center of a 3-star is connected to exactly three other nodes, we can look at the nodes and check if each node has exactly three neighbors. The nodes that satisfy this condition will be the centers of the 3-stars.

In this graph, nodes 0, 1, 2, 6, and 8 have exactly three neighbors each, so they can potentially be the centers of 3-stars. Let's now list out the 3-stars:

<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<1, (0, 4, 7)>
<6, (7, 8, 9)>

Therefore, there are [3] 3-stars in the given graph.
