Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is at the center of a 3-star pattern. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we can see that a 3-star pattern requires the central node to be connected to exactly 3 other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 4, and 7. (<1, (0, 4, 7)>)
2. Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 4, and 5. (<2, (1, 4, 5)>)
3. Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 4, and 8. (<6, (2, 4, 8)>)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
