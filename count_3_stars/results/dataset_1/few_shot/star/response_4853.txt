Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 5, and node 8

Response:
The central nodes in the 3-stars can be any of the 10 nodes in the graph. We will now check each node to see if it forms a 3-star. 

For Node 0:
Node 0 is connected to nodes 6 and 7. So, <0, (6, 7)> is a 3-star.

For Node 1:
Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 7. So, <1, (2, 3, 7)> is a 3-star.

For Node 2:
Node 2 is connected to nodes 1 and 8. Since it does not have exactly 3 connections, it does not form a 3-star.

For Node 3:
Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 7, and 8. So, <3, (1, 7, 8)> is a 3-star.

For Node 4:
Node 4 is connected to node 8 only. Since it does not have exactly 3 connections, it does not form a 3-star.

For Node 5:
Node 5 is connected to nodes 8 and 9. Since it does not have exactly 3 connections, it does not form a 3-star.

For Node 6:
Node 6 is connected to node 0 only. Since it does not have exactly 3 connections, it does not form a 3-star.

For Node 7:
Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 3. So, <7, (0, 1, 3)> is a 3-star.

For Node 8:
Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, 5, and 9. So, <8, (2, 4, 5)> is a 3-star.

For Node 9:
Node 9 is connected to nodes 5 and 8. Since it does not have exactly 3 connections, it does not form a 3-star.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are: <0, (6, 7)>, <1, (2, 3, 7)>, <3, (1, 7, 8)>, <7, (0, 1, 3)>, and <8, (2, 4, 5)>.

Count of 3-stars in the given graph: [5]
