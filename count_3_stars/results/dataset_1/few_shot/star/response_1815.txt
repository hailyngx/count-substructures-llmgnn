Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all unique 3-stars in the graph. 

Let's list out the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (6, 7, 9)>
<1, (4, 5, 8)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph and output the answer inside brackets.
