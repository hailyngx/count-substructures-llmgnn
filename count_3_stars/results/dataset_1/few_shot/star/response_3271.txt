Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (2, 5) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 4

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we can see that the nodes connected to exactly 3 other nodes are: node 5 and node 8. 

Next, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<5, (0, 2, 4)>
<5, (4, 6, 7)>
<5, (6, 7, 8)>
<5, (0, 2, 6)>
<5, (2, 6, 8)>
<5, (0, 4, 6)>
<8, (3, 4, 6)>
<8, (3, 4, 5)>
<8, (4, 5, 6)>

Count the number of 3-stars and provide the final answer inside brackets []:
[9]
