Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 8

- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2 and 8
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1 and 9
- Node 3 is connected to node 8
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 6, 7, 8, and 9
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 6, 7, and 8
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 4 and 5
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 4 and 5
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, and 5
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 4

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph.

There are a total of [9] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars: 
<0, (4, 8, 9)>
<1, (2, 8, -)>
<2, (1, 9, -)>
<3, (8, -, -)>
<4, (0, 6, 7)>
<4, (0, 8, 9)>
<4, (6, 5, -)>
<5, (6, 7, -)>
<5, (6, 8, -)>
