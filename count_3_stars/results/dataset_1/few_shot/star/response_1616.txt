Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars present in the graph. 

Here are the unique 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (3, 5, 1)>
<1, (3, 5, 0)>
<1, (5, 7, 8)>
<1, (8, 7, 5)>
<2, (5, 4, 8)>
<2, (8, 4, 5)>
<3, (0, 5, 6)>
<3, (5, 0, 1)>
<3, (1, 0, 5)>
<4, (5, 7, 8)>
<4, (8, 7, 5)>
<5, (0, 3, 1)>
<5, (1, 3, 0)>
<5, (1, 7, 4)>
<5, (1, 4, 7)>
<5, (2, 4, 8)>
<5, (2, 8, 4)>
<5, (3, 0, 6)>
<5, (3, 6, 0)>
<5, (4, 2, 8)>
<5, (4, 8, 2)>
<5, (7, 1, 4)>
<5, (7, 4, 1)>
<6, (3, 0, 5)>
<6, (5, 0, 3)>
<7, (1, 5, 4)>
<7, (4, 5, 1)>
<8, (1, 5, 4)>
<8, (5, 1, 4)>
<8, (2, 4, 5)>
<8, (5, 4, 2)>
<8, (4, 2, 5)>
<8, (4, 5, 2)>
<9, (3, 5, 4)>
<9, (5, 3, 4)>

Count of 3-stars in the graph: [35]
