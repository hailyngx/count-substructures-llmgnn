Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we'll look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes, making it the center of a 3-star. 

From the adjacency list provided, we see that:
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 4
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 6
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 9
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 9

Therefore, the list of unique 3-stars in the graph is:
<2, (0, 1, 4)>
<4, (1, 2, 6)>
<6, (4, 5, 9)>
<8, (3, 5, 9)>

Total number of 3-stars in the given graph: [4]
