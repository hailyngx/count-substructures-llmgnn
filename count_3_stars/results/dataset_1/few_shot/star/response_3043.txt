Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8)

Node 8 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible 3-stars.

Let's start by checking each node and its connections to see if it forms any 3-stars.

The nodes that are connected to exactly 3 nodes are potential centers for 3-stars.

Potential 3-stars centered at node 0:
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<0, (1, 2, 4)>

Potential 3-stars centered at node 1:
<1, (0, 2, 4)>

Potential 3-stars centered at node 2:
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<2, (0, 1, 4)>

Potential 3-stars centered at node 3:
<3, (0, 2, 4)>
<3, (2, 4, 9)>

Potential 3-stars centered at node 4:
<4, (0, 1, 2)>
<4, (0, 1, 3)>
<4, (8, 2, 5)>
<4, (8, 2, 9)>

Potential 3-stars centered at node 8:
<8, (4, 2, 5)>
<8, (4, 2, 9)>
<8, (5, 2, 9)>

Potential 3-stars centered at node 9:
<9, (5, 2, 8)>
<9, (3, 2, 4)>
<9, (3, 2, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [13]. 

<0, (1, 2, 3)>, <0, (1, 2, 4)>, <1, (0, 2, 4)>, <2, (0, 1, 3)>, <2, (0, 1, 4)>, <3, (0, 2, 4)>, <3, (2, 4, 9)>, <4, (0, 1, 2)>, <4, (0, 1, 3)>, <4, (8, 2, 5)>, <4, (8, 2, 9)>, <8, (4, 2, 5)>, <8, (4, 2, 9)>, <8, (5, 2, 9)>
