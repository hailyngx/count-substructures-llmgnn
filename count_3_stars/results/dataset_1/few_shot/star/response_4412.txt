Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, and node 8

Response:
Let's analyze the graph to find the 3-stars present. 

From the adjacency list, we can see that there are 5 nodes with degree 3: nodes 1, 4, 8, 9, and 3.

Now, we will look for all possible 3-stars in the graph based on these nodes.

1. For node 1:
   - <1, (0, 2, 8)>
   
2. For node 4:
   - <4, (0, 3, 8)>
   
3. For node 8:
   - <8, (1, 4, 5)>
   - <8, (4, 9, 1)>
   - <8, (5, 9, 4)>

4. For node 9:
   - <9, (3, 6, 8)>
   - <9, (5, 6, 8)>
   - <9, (6, 8, 3)>
   - <9, (8, 1, 3)>

5. For node 3:
   - <3, (2, 4, 9)>
   - <3, (4, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10]. 
The unique 3-stars are <1, (0, 2, 8)>, <4, (0, 3, 8)>, <8, (1, 4, 5)>, <8, (4, 9, 1)>, <8, (5, 9, 4)>, <9, (3, 6, 8)>, <9, (5, 6, 8)>, <9, (6, 8, 3)>, <9, (8, 1, 3)>, <3, (2, 4, 9)>, and <3, (4, 8, 9)>.
