Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (3, 9, 2)>
<1, (4, 7, 0)>
