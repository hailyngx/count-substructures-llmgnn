Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 6
