Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. These instances will represent 3-stars in the graph. Let's identify and count them:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 5. This forms a 3-star with Node 0 as the center and nodes 1, 2, and 5 as the leaves: <0, (1, 2, 5)>
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 6. This forms a 3-star with Node 1 as the center and nodes 0, 4, and 6 as the leaves: <1, (0, 4, 6)>
3. Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 6, and 7. This forms a 3-star with Node 4 as the center and nodes 1, 6, and 7 as the leaves: <4, (1, 6, 7)>
4. Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 5. This forms a 3-star with Node 6 as the center and nodes 1, 4, and 5 as the leaves: <6, (1, 4, 5)>
5. Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 7. This forms a 3-star with Node 9 as the center and nodes 1, 3, and 7 as the leaves: <9, (1, 3, 7)>

Therefore, there are a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
