Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 1

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern.

Looking at the adjacency list and the edges provided, we can identify the following 3-stars:

<0, (1, 8, 9)>
<1, (0, 6, 9)>
<2, (0, 1, 4)>
<3, (0, 6, 8)>
<4, (1, 2, 5)>
<5, (4)>
<6, (0, 1, 3)>
<7, (1, 3)>
<8, (0, 3)>
<9, (0, 1)>

Counting all the unique 3-stars listed above, we find a total of [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
