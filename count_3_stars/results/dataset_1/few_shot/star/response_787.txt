Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 2

Response:
Let's first identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0 is not part of any 3-star since it has less than 3 edges.
2. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 6, and 7: <1, (2, 6, 7)>
3. Node 2 forms two 3-stars with nodes 1, 4, and 6: <2, (1, 4, 6)> and <2, (1, 6, 7)>
4. Node 4 is not part of any 3-star since it has less than 3 edges.
5. Node 5 is not part of any 3-star since it has less than 3 edges.
6. Node 6 is not part of any 3-star since it has less than 3 edges.
7. Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 2, and 5: <7, (1, 2, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].  
The unique 3-stars found are: <1, (2, 6, 7)>, <2, (1, 4, 6)>, <2, (1, 6, 7)>, and <7, (1, 2, 5)>.
