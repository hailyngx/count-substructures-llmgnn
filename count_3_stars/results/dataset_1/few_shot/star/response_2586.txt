Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 4

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0: <0, (3, 6, 8)>
2. Node 2: <2, (3, 4, 5)>
3. Node 3: <3, (0, 2, 6)>
4. Node 4: <4, (2, 5, 6)>
5. Node 6: <6, (0, 4, 5)>

There are 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Thus, the final answer is [5].
