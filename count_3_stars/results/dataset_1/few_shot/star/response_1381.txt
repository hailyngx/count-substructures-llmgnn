Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 4
