Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 8

Response:
Let's find all the 3-star structures in the given graph:

From the adjacency list, we can identify the 3-star structures where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Here are the 3-star structures in this graph:
<0, (3, 8), (2, 8)>
<1, (6, 2), (7, 8)>
<2, (3, 5), (6, 9)>
<4, (3, 5), (7, 8)>
<5, (2, 4), (6, 9)>
<6, (1, 2), (5, 7)>
<7, (4, 6), (8, 9)>
<8, (0, 4), (6, 9)>
<9, (2, 5), (8, 5)>

[The total number of 3-star structures in the given graph is 9.]
