Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, as per the definition of a 3-star. 

Looking at the graph and the adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars:

1. <1, (2, 4, 6)>
2. <2, (1, 7, 8)>
3. <3, (5, 6, 7)>
4. <4, (1, 6, 9)>
5. <5, (3, 7, 9)>
6. <6, (2, 3, 4)>
7. <7, (0, 5, 8)>
8. <8, (0, 2, 7)>
9. <9, (5, 7, 4)>

Therefore, there are a total of [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
