Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 5, and node 7

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the central node and its adjacent nodes for each potential 3-star in the graph. 

Let's find the 3-stars:

1. For node 0: (0, 3, 5), (0, 3, 9)
2. For node 1: (1, 3, 8)
3. For node 3: (3, 0, 1), (3, 0, 2), (3, 0, 9), (3, 1, 9)
4. For node 4: (4, 8, 9)
5. For node 5: (5, 0, 9)
6. For node 6: (6, 7, 8)
7. For node 7: (7, 6, 9)
8. For node 8: (8, 1, 4), (8, 1, 6)
9. For node 9: (9, 0, 3), (9, 0, 5), (9, 0, 7), (9, 3, 4), (9, 3, 7)

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].

The unique 3-stars in the graph are:
<0, (3, 5, 9)>
<1, (3, 8)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<3, (0, 9)>
<4, (8, 9)>
<5, (0, 9)>
<6, (7, 8)>
<7, (6, 9)>
<8, (1, 4, 6)>
<9, (0, 3, 5)>
<9, (0, 7)>
<9, (3, 4)>
<9, (3, 7)>
