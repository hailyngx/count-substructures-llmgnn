Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 6

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 
Based on the definition provided, a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we can find the following 3-stars:

<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<1, (5, 4, 6)>
<2, (0, 3, 4)>
<3, (2, 6, 7)>
<4, (2, 5, 7)>
<5, (1, 4, 2)>
<6, (1, 2, 3)>
<7, (4, 6, 9)>
<8, (4, 2, 5)>
<9, (4, 6, 1)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
