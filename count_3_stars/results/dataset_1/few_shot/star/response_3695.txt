Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 6
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-star configurations.

Starting with the given graph:
- Nodes 0, 1, 7 form a 3-star centered at node 1: <1, (0, 7)>
- Nodes 1, 4, 6 form a 3-star centered at node 1: <1, (4, 6)>
- Nodes 1, 6, 7 form a 3-star centered at node 1: <1, (6, 7)>
- Nodes 4, 1, 6 form a 3-star centered at node 4: <4, (1, 6)>
- Nodes 6, 1, 3 form a 3-star centered at node 6: <6, (1, 3)>
- Nodes 6, 4, 5 form a 3-star centered at node 6: <6, (4, 5)>
- Nodes 6, 7, 0 form a 3-star centered at node 6: <6, (7, 0)>
- Nodes 6, 7, 3 form a 3-star centered at node 6: <6, (7, 3)>
- Nodes 7, 0, 1 form a 3-star centered at node 7: <7, (0, 1)>
- Nodes 7, 3, 6 form a 3-star centered at node 7: <7, (3, 6)>
- Nodes 7, 8, 6 form a 3-star centered at node 7: <7, (8, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [11].
The unique 3-stars found are: <1, (0, 7)>, <1, (4, 6)>, <1, (6, 7)>, <4, (1, 6)>, <6, (1, 3)>, <6, (4, 5)>, <6, (7, 0)>, <6, (7, 3)>, <7, (0, 1)>, <7, (3, 6)>, <7, (8, 6)>.
