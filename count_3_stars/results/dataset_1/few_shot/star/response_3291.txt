Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify the 3-stars present. 

As a reminder, a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

The unique 3-stars in the graph are:
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<1, (0, 4, 9)>
<3, (2, 6, 8)>
<7, (4, 5, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 8)> 

Now let's count the total number of 3-stars: [5].
