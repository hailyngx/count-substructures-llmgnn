Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify unique instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's determine all such 3-star configurations:

<0, (2, 5, 7)>
<1, (3, 4, 9)>
<2, (0, 3, 4)>
<3, (1, 2, 6)>
<4, (1, 2, 5)>
<5, (0, 4, 9)>
<6, (3, 7)>
<9, (1, 2, 5)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars: [8].
