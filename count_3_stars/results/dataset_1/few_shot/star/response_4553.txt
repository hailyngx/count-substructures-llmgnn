Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 5

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 8, and 9: <1, (2, 8, 9)>
2. Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 4, and 1: <2, (1, 4, 1)>
3. Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 5, and 6: <3, (1, 5, 6)>
4. Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 2, and 9: <4, (0, 2, 9)>
5. Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 3, and 9: <5, (0, 3, 9)>
6. Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 5, and 6: <8, (1, 5, 6)>
7. Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 4, and 5: <9, (1, 4, 5)>

Count of 3-stars: [7]
