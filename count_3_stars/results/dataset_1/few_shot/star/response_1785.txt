Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 3

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are as follows:
<0, (4, 8, 1)>
<1, (3, 5, 6)>
<1, (5, 9, 1)>
<2, (6, 1, 9)>
<3, (1, 9, 4)>
<4, (3, 6, 0)>
<5, (8, 1, 5)>
<6, (2, 1, 9)>
<6, (4, 1, 6)>
