Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 7
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 6, and node 8

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

The 3-stars are: 
<3, (4, 5, 8)>
<5, (0, 3, 7)>
<6, (4, 7, 8)>
<8, (3, 6, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
