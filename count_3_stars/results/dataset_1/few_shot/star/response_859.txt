Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 4, 6, and node 8

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the 3-stars. Since a 3-star graph has a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we need to find nodes that have exactly three neighbors. 

From the adjacency list, we can see that nodes 1, 2, and 8 satisfy this condition. Next, we will check the neighbors of these nodes to see if they form 3-stars around them.

For node 1, the neighbors are 2, 3, and 7. Node 2 is a neighbor of node 1, forming a 3-star <1, (2, 3, 7)>. 

For node 2, the neighbors are 1, 3, and 7. Node 1 is a neighbor of node 2, forming a 3-star <2, (1, 3, 7)>. 

For node 8, the neighbors are 7 and 9. Neither of these nodes has exactly three neighbors, so node 8 cannot be the central node of a 3-star.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2]. 
The unique 3-stars are <1, (2, 3, 7)> and <2, (1, 3, 7)>.
