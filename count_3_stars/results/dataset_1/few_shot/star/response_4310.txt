Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 0
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 3

Response:
There are 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

1. <0, (1, 5, 8)>
2. <2, (4, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
