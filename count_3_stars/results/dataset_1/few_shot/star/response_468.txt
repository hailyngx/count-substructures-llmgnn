Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 8

Response:
The first step is to identify the 3-stars in the graph. A 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Given the adjacency information, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph.

Let's list the 3-stars found in the graph:
<1, (5, 7, 8)>
<3, (4, 8, 9)>
<4, (3, 5, 7)>
<5, (1, 4, 6)>
<8, (1, 2, 9)>

Now, count the total number of 3-stars found.
