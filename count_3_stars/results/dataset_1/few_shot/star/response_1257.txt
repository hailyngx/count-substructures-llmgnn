Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 8

Response:
We can count the number of 3-stars in the graph by identifying each node's connectivity pattern to form stars.

Let's go through each node and analyze if it is the center of any 3-star:

**Node 0:**
- Connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, 7, and 8
- They form the 3-star: <0, (1, 4, 8)>
  
**Node 1:**
- Connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8
- They form the 3-star: <1, (0, 4, 8)>
  
**Node 2:**
- Connected to nodes 0, 1, and 4
- They form the 3-star: <2, (0, 1, 4)>
  
**Node 3:**
- Connected to nodes 5, and 9
- No 3-star can be formed with node 3 as the center.
  
**Node 4:**
- Connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 5, and 8
- They form the 3-star: <4, (0, 1, 8)>
  
**Node 5:**
- Connected to nodes 3, 4, 6, and 7
- No 3-star can be formed with node 5 as the center.
  
**Node 6:**
- Connected to nodes 1, 5, and 9
- No 3-star can be formed with node 6 as the center.
  
**Node 7:**
- Connected to nodes 0, and 5
- No 3-star can be formed with node 7 as the center.
  
**Node 8:**
- Connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, and 9
- No additional 3-star can be formed with node 8 as the center.
  
**Node 9:**
- Connected to nodes 3, 6, and 8
- No 3-star can be formed with node 9 as the center.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is simply the count of unique 3-stars identified above, which is **4**.
