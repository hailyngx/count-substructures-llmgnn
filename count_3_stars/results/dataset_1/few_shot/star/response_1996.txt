Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 7

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph based on the definition provided.

There are several 3-stars in the given graph:
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<0, (2, 3, 5)>
<0, (3, 5, 7)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<3, (0, 2, 6)>
<3, (6, 4, 8)>
<5, (0, 7, 9)>
<8, (1, 2, 4)>
<8, (1, 4, 5)>
<8, (2, 4, 6)>
<8, (5, 4, 6)>
<9, (2, 5, 7)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we get a total of [13].
