Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 8) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 8
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star pattern in the graph. 

From the adjacency list given, we can see that nodes 0, 4, and 8 are potential central nodes for 3-stars as they are connected to exactly 3 other nodes.

Let's analyze each potential central node:
1. For node 0:
    - Nodes 1, 2, and 4 are connected to node 0, forming a 3-star with node 0 as the center.
    - <0, (1, 2, 4)>

2. For node 4:
    - Nodes 0, 7, and 8 are connected to node 4, forming a 3-star with node 4 as the center.
    - <4, (0, 7, 8)>

3. For node 8:
    - Nodes 2, 4, and 5 are connected to node 8, forming a 3-star with node 8 as the center.
    - <8, (2, 4, 5)>
    - Nodes 4, 7, and 5 are connected to node 8, forming another 3-star with node 8 as the center.
    - <8, (4, 7, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
