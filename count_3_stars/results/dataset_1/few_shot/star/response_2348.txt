Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can analyze each node to see if it is at the center of a 3-star. 

Node 0: (0, 3, 5, 7), (0, 5, 7, 8) -> <0, (3, 5, 7)> 
Node 1: (1, 2, 4), (1, 4, 8) -> <1, (2, 4, 8)> 
Node 2: (2, 1, 4) -> No 3-star
Node 3: (3, 0, 7) -> No 3-star
Node 4: (4, 1, 2) -> No 3-star
Node 5: (5, 0, 7) -> No 3-star
Node 6: No possible 3-star
Node 7: (7, 0, 3) -> No 3-star
Node 8: (8, 0, 1), (8, 1, 9) -> <8, (0, 1, 9)> 
Node 9: No possible 3-star 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3] <0, (3, 5, 7)>, <1, (2, 4, 8)>, and <8, (0, 1, 9)>.
