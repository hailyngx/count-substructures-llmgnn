Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars:

<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<0, (4, 3, 5)>
<1, (0, 3, 8)>
<2, (5, 6, 7)>
<3, (1, 4, 5)>
<3, (4, 0, 5)>
<3, (5, 2, 7)>
<6, (2, 7, 5)>
<8, (0, 1, 9)>

Now, count the total number of 3-stars: [10].
