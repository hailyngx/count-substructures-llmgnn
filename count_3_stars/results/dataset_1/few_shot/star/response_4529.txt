Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 8

Response:
First, we need to identify the 3-stars in the graph based on the definition provided. 
A 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes.

From the given adjacency list, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (6, 8)>
<1, (7)>
<2, (3, 4, 5)>
<3, (2, 6, 8)>
<6, (0, 2, 5)>
<7, (1, 3, 6)>
<8, (0, 3, 9)>
<9, (2, 8)>

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars in the graph. 
There are 8 unique 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
