Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node and its three leaf nodes for each 3-star. 

Looking at the adjacency list, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 1, 2, and 9. <0, (1, 2, 9)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 0, 4, and 9. <2, (0, 4, 9)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 1, 2, and 8. <7, (1, 2, 8)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 0, 2, and 5. <9, (0, 2, 5)>

Therefore, there are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.  
Here are the unique 3-stars: 
<0, (1, 2, 9)>
<2, (0, 4, 9)>
<7, (1, 2, 8)>
<9, (0, 2, 5)>
