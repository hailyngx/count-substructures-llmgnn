Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are central to a 3-star in this graph. 
A 3-star will have the central node connected to exactly three other nodes. We will list the central nodes and their connected nodes below:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 4, 8
- Node 3: 0, 1, 5, 6
- Node 4: 0, 6, 7
- Node 6: 3, 4, 7, 9
- Node 7: 4, 6, 8

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars in the graph:
- <0, (2, 3, 4)> 
- <0, (2, 3, 8)> 
- <0, (3, 4, 8)> 
- <3, (0, 5, 6)> 
- <3, (1, 5, 6)> 
- <4, (0, 6, 7)> 
- <6, (3, 4, 7)> 

So, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
