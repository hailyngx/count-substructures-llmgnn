Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 2

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star: <0, (4, 5, 7)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star: <6, (1, 3, 4)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star: <7, (0, 1, 5)>

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in the graph.
