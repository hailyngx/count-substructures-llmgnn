Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 3

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the graph, we can identify each 3-star pattern where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through each node and see if it forms a 3-star.

1. Node 0: <0, (4, 6, 7)> [1]
2. Node 1: <1, (3, 6, 8)> [2]
3. Node 3: <3, (1, 2, 4)> [3]
4. Node 4: <4, (0, 3, 8)> [4]
5. Node 6: <6, (0, 1, 5)> [5]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
