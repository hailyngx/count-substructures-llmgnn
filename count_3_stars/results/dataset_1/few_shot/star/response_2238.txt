Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 6

Response:
First, let's find the nodes that are connected to exactly 3 other nodes, which would represent the potential central nodes of 3-stars.

Nodes 0, 4, and 6 are connected to 3 other nodes each:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 7
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 7, and 8
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 4, 8, and 9

Next, let's determine the 3-stars based on these central nodes:
- For Node 0: <0, (3, 5, 7)>
- For Node 4: <4, (1, 5, 7)> and <4, (5, 6, 8)>
- For Node 6: <6, (4, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
