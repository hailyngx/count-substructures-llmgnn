Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for each possible configuration.

First, let's analyze each node's connections to identify the 3-stars.

- Node 0 forms one 3-star with nodes 1, 2, and 5: <0, (1, 2, 5)>
- Node 1 forms three 3-stars: 
  1. <1, (0, 5, 6)>
  2. <1, (0, 8, 9)>
  3. <1, (5, 6, 8)>
- Node 2 forms one 3-star with nodes 0, 3, and 6: <2, (0, 3, 6)>
- Node 4 forms one 3-star with nodes 9, 1, and 8: <4, (9, 1, 8)>
- Node 5 forms one 3-star with nodes 0, 1, and 6: <5, (0, 1, 6)>
- Node 6 forms one 3-star with nodes 1, 2, and 8: <6, (1, 2, 8)>
- Node 7 does not form any 3-star.
- Node 8 forms one 3-star with nodes 1, 6, and 9: <8, (1, 6, 9)>
- Node 9 forms one 3-star with nodes 1, 4, and 8: <9, (1, 4, 8)>

Counting all the unique 3-stars found above, we have a total of [8] 3-stars.
