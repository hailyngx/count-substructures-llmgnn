Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we can see that the possible 3-stars involving each node are:
- Node 0: <0, (1, 3, 4)>, <0, (1, 6, 7)>
- Node 1: <1, (0, 2, 3)>, <1, (0, 6, 7)>
- Node 2: <2, (1, 6, 8)>
- Node 3: <3, (0, 1, 8)>
- Node 4: <4, (0, 8, 2)>
- Node 5: No 3-star as it is only connected to one node.
- Node 6: <6, (0, 1, 2)>, <6, (0, 1, 9)>
- Node 7: No 3-star as it is only connected to two nodes.
- Node 8: No 3-star as it is only connected to two nodes.
- Node 9: No 3-star as it is only connected to one node.

Adding all the unique 3-stars together, we get:
<0, (1, 3, 4)>, <0, (1, 6, 7)>, <1, (0, 2, 3)>, <1, (0, 6, 7)>, <2, (1, 6, 8)>, <3, (0, 1, 8)>, <4, (0, 8, 2)>, <6, (0, 1, 2)>, <6, (0, 1, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
