Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 8

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph:

<0, (1, 3, 2)>
<1, (0, 4, 6)>
<2, (3, 8, 9)>
<3, (0, 2, 9)>
<4, (1, 6, 7)>
<5, (9)>
<6, (1, 4)>
<7, (4, 8)>
<8, (2, 4, 7, 9)>
<9, (3, 4, 5, 8)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph: 
[9]
