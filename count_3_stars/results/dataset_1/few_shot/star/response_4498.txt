Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 2

Response:
The 3-star graph in the given graph is as follows: 

<1, (5, 6, 0)>
<2, (3, 8, 9)>
