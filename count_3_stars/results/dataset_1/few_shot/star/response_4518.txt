Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list down the unique 3-stars in this graph:

<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<3, (0, 4, 9)>
<4, (0, 3, 9)>
<5, (6, 8, 9)>
<6, (5, 7, 9)>
<7, (2, 6, 8)>
<8, (5, 7, 9)>
<9, (4, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
