Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, and node 9
