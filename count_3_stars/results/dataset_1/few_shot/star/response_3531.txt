Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 6

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that can act as the center of a 3-star graph, i.e., nodes with exactly three neighbors. These nodes are: 2, 5, and 6.

Next, let's find all possible 3-stars centered at each of these nodes:
- For node 2:
    - <2, (3, 5, 6)>
- For node 5:
    - <5, (3, 7, 9)>
- For node 6:
    - <6, (0, 2, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: 
<2, (3, 5, 6)>
<5, (3, 7, 9)>
<6, (0, 2, 9)>
