Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars, we look for nodes that have degree 3 as they can potentially be the center of a 3-star. 

From the given graph:
- Nodes 0, 1, 4, and 6 have degree 4 (exceeding 3), so they cannot be the center of a 3-star.
- Nodes 2, 3, 5, and 7 have degree 2 (less than 3), so they cannot be the center of a 3-star.
- Node 8 is isolated and cannot be the center of a 3-star.
- Node 9 has degree 1 (less than 3), so it cannot be the center of a 3-star.

Therefore, there are no 3-stars in the given graph.
