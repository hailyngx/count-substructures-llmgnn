Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-star configurations in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern.

Looking at the adjacency list for each node, we can identify the 3-star configurations. Let's identify and count them:

<0, (2, 7, 8)>
<2, (0, 1, 4)>
<4, (2, 5, 6)>
<7, (0, 3, 5)>
<9, (3, 4, 6)>

Therefore, there are a total of [5] 3-star configurations in the given graph.
