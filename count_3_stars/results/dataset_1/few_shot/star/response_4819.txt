Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 4

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes and their adjacent nodes:

- Node 1 has 4 adjacent nodes: 2, 3, 4, 5
- Node 5 has 3 adjacent nodes: 0, 1, 7
- Node 2 has 3 adjacent nodes: 1, 6, 8
- Node 3 has 3 adjacent nodes: 1, 6, 7
- Node 4 has 2 adjacent nodes: 1, 9

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:

- From node 1: <1, (2, 3, 4)>, <1, (2, 3, 5)>, <1, (2, 4, 5)>, <1, (3, 4, 5)>
- From node 5: <5, (0, 1, 7)>
- From node 2: <2, (1, 3, 6)>, <2, (1, 6, 8)>, <2, (3, 6, 8)>
- From node 3: <3, (1, 6, 7)>
- From node 4: <4, (1, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
