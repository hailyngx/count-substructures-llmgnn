Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we'll need to identify each unique 3-star. A 3-star is formed by a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Analyzing the given graph, we can identify the following unique 3-stars: 
<0, (2, 5, 6)>
<0, (5, 6, 7)>
<1, (5, 6, 9)>
<2, (0, 7, 9)>
<3, (4, 6, 8)>
<4, (3, 6)>
<5, (0, 1, 6)>
<5, (6, 9)>
<6, (0, 1, 7)>
<6, (3, 4, 5)>
<6, (4, 7, 8)>
<7, (0, 2, 6)>
<8, (3, 6)>
<9, (1, 2, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
