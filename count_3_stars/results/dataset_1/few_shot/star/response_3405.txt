Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique instance where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes through edges. 

Based on the provided information, the 3-stars in this graph can be listed as follows:
<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<1, (0, 7, 9)>
<3, (2, 0, 8)>
<7, (1, 4, 5)>
<8, (0, 3, 5)>
  
Therefore, there are [5] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
