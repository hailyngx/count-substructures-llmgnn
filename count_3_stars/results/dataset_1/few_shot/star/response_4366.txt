Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 6) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 6
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 8

Response:
The center node of a 3-star is a node connected to exactly 3 other nodes. 
Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

1. Node 0 is a center node connected to nodes 1, 8.
2. Node 1 is a center node connected to nodes 0, 9.
3. Node 8 is a center node connected to nodes 0, 9.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
Unique 3-stars: <<0, (1, 8)>, <1, (0, 9)>, <8, (0, 9)>]
