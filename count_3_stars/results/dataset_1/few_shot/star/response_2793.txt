Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star pattern where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Looking at the graph and the provided information, we can determine the 3-stars as follows:

<0, (2, 8, 5)>
<3, (2, 5, 9)>
<5, (2, 3, 8)>
<8, (0, 5, 6)>
<8, (0, 5, 7)>
<8, (6, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
