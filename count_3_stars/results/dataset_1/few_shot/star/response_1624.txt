Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 6

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated by checking each node as a potential center of a 3-star and counting the number of such 3-stars. 

Here is the list of unique 3-stars in the given graph:
<0, (2, 9, 6)>
<1, (2, 3, 6)>
<2, (0, 1, 5)>
<3, (1, 7, 6)>
<4, (5, 6, 8)>
<5, (2, 4, 6)>
<6, (1, 4, 9)>
<7, (3, 4, 6)>
<8, (4, 6, 0)>
<9, (0, 6, 1)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
