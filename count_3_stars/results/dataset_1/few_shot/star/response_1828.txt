Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 4

Response:
Starting from each node, count the number of unique 3-stars in the graph:

From node 0:
- <0, (3, 4, 6)>
- Total: 1

From node 1:
- <1, (3, 4, 9)>
- Total: 1

From node 2:
No 3-stars possible.

From node 3:
- <3, (0, 1, 5)>
- <3, (0, 1, 7)>
- <3, (0, 1, 8)>
- <3, (5, 6, 7)>
- Total: 4

From node 4:
- <4, (0, 1, 9)>
- Total: 1

From node 5:
No 3-stars possible.

From node 6:
- <6, (0, 3, 5)>
- Total: 1

From node 7:
No 3-stars possible.

From node 8:
No 3-stars possible.

From node 9:
No 3-stars possible.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
