Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 9
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 5, and node 8

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star in the graph. 

Let's first list the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (1, 2, 7)>
<0, (1, 2, 9)>
<1, (0, 2, 9)>
<2, (0, 1, 7)>
<2, (1, 4, 5)>
<2, (3, 4, 5)>
<4, (2, 5, 7)>
<7, (0, 2, 4)>
<9, (0, 1, 4)>
<9, (0, 5, 8)>

There are 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
