Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 7

Response:
To find all the 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is the center of a 3-star. We will then list these unique 3-stars.

Based on the given information, the 3-stars in the graph are as follows:
<1, (4, 6, 7)>
<1, (4, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
