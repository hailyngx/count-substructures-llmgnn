Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes (i.e., form a 3-star structure).

Upon examining the given graph, we can find the following 3-stars:
<0, (2, 5, 8)>
<1, (4, 7, 2)>
<2, (0, 4, 6)>
<3, (6, 8, -)>
<4, (1, 2, 6)>
<5, (0, 6, 7)>
<6, (2, 3, 4)>
<7, (1, 5, 9)>
<8, (0, 3, 4)>
<9, (6, 7, -)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
