Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 5

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 2 forms a 3-star: <2, (1, 4, 5)>
- Node 3 forms two 3-stars: <3, (2, 4, 5)> and <3, (4, 5, 7)>
- Node 4 also forms a 3-star: <4, (1, 2, 5)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
