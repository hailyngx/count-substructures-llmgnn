Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 4
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 3

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star configuration. 

Let's go through each node:
- Node 0 forms 3-star with (3, 6, 7)
- Node 1 does not form a 3-star as it has only 2 connected nodes.
- Node 2 forms 3-stars with (5, 6, 7) and (6, 7, 9).
- Node 3 does not form a 3-star as it has only 2 connected nodes.
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with (1, 7, 9).
- Node 5 does not form a 3-star as it has only 1 connected node.
- Node 6 does not form a 3-star as it has only 2 connected nodes.
- Node 7 does not form a 3-star as it has 3 connected nodes.
- Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
- Node 9 does not form a 3-star as it has only 3 connected nodes.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the graph are:
<0, (3, 6, 7)> 
<2, (5, 6, 7)> 
<2, (6, 7, 9)> 
<4, (1, 7, 9)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
