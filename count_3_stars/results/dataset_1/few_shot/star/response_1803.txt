Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we can identify all such 3-stars:

[<0, (3, 8, 1)>, <2, (1, 3, 5)>, <3, (0, 1, 5)>, <4, (2, 8, 9)>, <5, (3, 2, -)>, <6, (2, 3, -)>, <7, (8, 9, -)>, <8, (0, 3, 4)>, <9, (4, 7, -)>]

Count of 3-stars: [9]
