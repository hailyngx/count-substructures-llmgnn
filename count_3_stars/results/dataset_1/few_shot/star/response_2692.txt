Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 4, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Let's find the 3-stars:

1. <0, (2, 6, 9)>
2. <1, (6, 7, 9)>
3. <2, (0, 4, 6)>
4. <3, (4, 9, *)>
5. <5, (4, 6, 8)>
6. <7, (1, 4, 9)>
7. <8, (5, 9, *)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
