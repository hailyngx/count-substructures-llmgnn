Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8)

Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first identify the nodes that can act as centers of 3-stars. These are the nodes that have exactly three neighbors. Then, for each of these potential center nodes, we check if they are indeed the center of a 3-star by verifying if the neighbors are also connected to each other. 

In this case, the nodes that can act as centers of 3-stars are nodes 1, 3, 5, and 9 (since they each have exactly three neighbors). Let's check if they form 3-stars:

1. For node 1:
   - <1, (0, 2, 6)>
  
2. For node 3:
   - <3, (0, 5, 8)>

3. For node 5:
   - <5, (3, 6, 8)>

4. For node 9:
   - <9, (1, 3, 8)>
  
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
