Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 7) (2, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7)

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Given the adjacency list, we can see that the nodes with more than three edges are potential central nodes of 3-stars. These nodes are 1, 6, 7, and 8. 

Let's analyze each potential central node:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. 
  - <1, (4, 5, 6)>
  - <1, (4, 5, 8)>
  - <1, (4, 6, 7)>
  - <1, (4, 7, 8)>
  - <1, (5, 6, 8)>
  - <1, (5, 7, 8)>
  - Total for node 1: 6

- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 5, 7, and 9.
  - <6, (1, 4, 5)>
  - <6, (1, 7, 9)>
  - <6, (4, 5, 7)>
  - <6, (4, 7, 9)>
  - <6, (5, 7, 9)>
  - Total for node 6: 5

- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 6, 8, and 9.
  - <7, (0, 1, 8)>
  - <7, (0, 2, 9)>
  - <7, (1, 6, 9)>
  - <7, (1, 8, 9)>
  - <7, (2, 6, 9)>
  - <7, (6, 8, 9)>
  - Total for node 7: 6

- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 5, and 7.
  - <8, (1, 4, 5)>
  - <8, (1, 4, 7)>
  - <8, (1, 5, 7)>
  - <8, (4, 5, 7)>
  - Total for node 8: 4

Finally, summing up all the unique 3-stars found for each potential central node: 6 + 5 + 6 + 4 = 21.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [21].
