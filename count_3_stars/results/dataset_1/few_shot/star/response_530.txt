Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 6, and node 8

Response:
Let's identify all the 3-stars in this graph:

<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<2, (0, 1, 4)>
<2, (1, 4, 7)>
<6, (0, 1, 9)>
<7, (1, 2, 8)>
<8, (7, 9, 2)>

So, there are a total of [7] 3-stars in this graph.
