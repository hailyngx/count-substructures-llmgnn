Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, and node 8

Response:
Based on the given graph and information, the 3-stars can be found as follows:

<0, (1, 9, 0)>
<1, (0, 6, 7)>
<1, (0, 7, 9)>
<1, (6, 7, 9)>
<5, (7, 8, 5)>
<6, (1, 9, 6)>
<7, (1, 5, 7)>
<8, (5, 9, 8)>
<9, (0, 1, 9)>
<9, (6, 8, 9)>

Therefore, there are [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
