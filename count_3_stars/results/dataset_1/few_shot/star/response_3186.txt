Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can start by identifying the central nodes and their corresponding leaves. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes (leaves).

Looking at the adjacency list, the nodes and their connections are as follows:

- Node 0 has leaves 1, 4, 5, and 7
- Node 1 has leaves 0, 4, 5, 7, and 9
- Node 2 has leaves 6 and 9
- Node 3 has leaves 4 and 6
- Node 4 has leaves 0, 1, and 3
- Node 5 has leaves 0 and 1
- Node 6 has leaves 2, 3, and 9
- Node 7 has leaves 0, 1, and 9
- Node 8 has leaf 1
- Node 9 has leaves 0, 1, 2, 6, and 7

Now, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph by finding central nodes connected to exactly three other nodes:

- Node 0 forms a 3-star with leaves 1, 4, and 5 (3-star: <0, (1, 4, 5)>)
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with leaves 0, 4, and 5 (3-star: <1, (0, 4, 5)>)
- Node 1 forms another 3-star with leaves 7, 8, and 9 (3-star: <1, (7, 8, 9)>)
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with leaves 3, 0, and 1 (3-star: <4, (3, 0, 1)>)
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with leaves 2, 3, and 9 (3-star: <6, (2, 3, 9)>)
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with leaves 0, 1, and 9 (3-star: <7, (0, 1, 9)>)

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
