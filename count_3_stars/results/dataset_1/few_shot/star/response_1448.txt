Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern.

Let's identify the 3-stars:
<1, (4, 5, 8)>
<4, (1, 3, 9)>
<5, (1, 7, _)> (Incomplete star with node 7 as unknown leaf)
<8, (1, 6, _)>
<9, (4, 6, 7)>

Counting the unique 3-stars we identified, the final answer is [4].
