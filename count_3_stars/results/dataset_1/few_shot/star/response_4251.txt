Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 6

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
- Node 0: None
- Node 1: None
- Node 2: None
- Node 3: None
- Node 4: None
- Node 5: <5, (0, 2, 7)>
- Node 6: None
- Node 7: None
- Node 8: <8, (0, 1, 2)>
- Node 9: None

Count of 3-stars: [2]
Unique 3-stars: <<5, (0, 2, 7)>, <8, (0, 1, 2)>]
