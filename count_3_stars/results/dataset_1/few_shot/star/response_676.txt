Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 7

Response:
There are two 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 4, 8)>
<9, (5, 7, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
