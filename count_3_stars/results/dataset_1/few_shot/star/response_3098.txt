Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 7) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph, we need to identify all unique instances of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Here are the steps to find and count the 3-stars in the graph:

1. First, let's identify the nodes that have exactly three neighbors:
- Node 0: neighbors 1, 2, 9
- Node 1: neighbors 0, 8, 9
- Node 8: neighbors 1, 5, 6
- Node 9: neighbors 0, 1, 6

2. Then, we list all unique 3-star graphs in the format <center, (leaf1, leaf2, leaf3)>:
- <0, (1, 2, 9)>
- <1, (0, 8, 9)>
- <8, (1, 5, 6)>
- <9, (0, 1, 6)>

3. Finally, we count the total number of unique 3-stars:
- There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph.

So, the final count of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
