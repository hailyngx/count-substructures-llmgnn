Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern. 

Analyzing the provided information, we can determine the 3-stars in the graph:

1. <0, (2, 5, 6)>
2. <1, (4, 6, 0)>
3. <2, (0, 4, 9)>
4. <3, (7, 9, 0)>
5. <4, (1, 2, 0)>
6. <5, (0, 8, 6)>
7. <6, (0, 1, 8)>
8. <7, (3, 9, 8)>
9. <8, (5, 6, 9)>
10. <9, (2, 7, 8)>

Count of 3-stars: [10]
