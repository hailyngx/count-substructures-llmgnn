Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars, we need to find all instances where a node has exactly three neighbors and those neighbors do not share an edge. These instances represent the centers of 3-stars in the graph.

Looking at the adjacency list for each node:
- Node 0 satisfies the conditions (nodes 2, 5, and 8 are not connected to each other).
- Node 1 does not satisfy the conditions as nodes 2 and 6 are connected.
- Node 2 does not satisfy the conditions as nodes 0 and 1 are connected.
- Node 3 has no connections.
- Node 4 satisfies the conditions (nodes 6, 8, and 9 are not connected to each other).
- Node 5 does not satisfy the conditions as nodes 0 and 8 are connected.
- Node 6 does not satisfy the conditions as nodes 1 and 4 are connected.
- Node 7 has no connections.
- Node 8 does not satisfy the conditions as nodes 0 and 2 are connected.
- Node 9 satisfies the conditions (nodes 2 and 4 are not connected to each other).

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the graph are:
<0, (2, 5, 8)>
<4, (6, 8, 9)>
<9, (2, 4, 9)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
