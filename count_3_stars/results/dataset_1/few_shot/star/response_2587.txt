Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, and node 6

Response:
Let's start by identifying the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, and 7: <0, (1, 3, 7)>
2. Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 4, and 7: <3, (0, 4, 7)>
3. Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 2, and 9: <6, (1, 2, 9)>
4. Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 3, and 8: <7, (0, 3, 8)>
5. Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 6, and 0: <9, (5, 6, 0)>

Count of 3-stars: [5]
