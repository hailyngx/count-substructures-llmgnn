Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Here are the 3-stars in the graph:

[6]

<3, (1, 4, 7)>
<4, (1, 3, 8)>
<7, (3, 1, 9)>
<8, (4, 2, 9)>
