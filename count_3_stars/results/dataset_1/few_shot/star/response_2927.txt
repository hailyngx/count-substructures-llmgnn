Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star (a central node connected to exactly three other nodes) in the graph.

Here is the list of unique 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<1, (4, 5, 6)>
<1, (4, 7, 9)>
<1, (5, 6, 7)>
<4, (0, 1, 7)>
<4, (1, 2, 7)>
<7, (1, 4, 9)>

Count of 3-stars in the graph: [7]
