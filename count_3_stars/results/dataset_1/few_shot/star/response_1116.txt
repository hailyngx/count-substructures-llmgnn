Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each instance where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern.

After analyzing the provided graph information, we can determine the 3-stars and count them. The unique 3-stars in the given graph are:

<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<3, (5, 6, 7)>
<4, (0, 6, 9)>
<5, (0, 6, 7)>
<6, (0, 4, 5)>
<7, (3, 5, 6)>
<8, (6, 9, _)>

where (_) represents an additional edge to node 8 from an unknown source.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
