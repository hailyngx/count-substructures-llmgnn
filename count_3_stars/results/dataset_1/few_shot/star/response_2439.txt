Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern. 

Looking at the adjacency list provided, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (5, 6, 9)>
<1, (5, 6, 9)>
<2, (4, 6, 9)>
<3, (5, 9)>
<4, (2, 8, 9)>
<6, (0, 1, 7)>
<7, (1, 2, 6)>
<8, (1, 4, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8] <0, (5, 6, 9)>, <1, (5, 6, 9)>, <2, (4, 6, 9)>, <3, (5, 9)>, <4, (2, 8, 9)>, <6, (0, 1, 7)>, <7, (1, 2, 6)>, <8, (1, 4, 9)>.
