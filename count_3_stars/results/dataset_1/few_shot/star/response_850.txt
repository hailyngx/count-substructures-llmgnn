Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star configuration. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in this graph:
<0, (1, 7, 8)>
<1, (0, 3, 6)>
<2, (4, 6, 8)>
<4, (2, 9, 6)>
<5, (7, 8, -)>
<-, (7, 8, 5)>
<6, (1, 2, 7)>
<7, (0, 1, 5)>
<8, (0, 2, 5)>
<9, (4, 6, -)>
<-, (5, 8, 7)>

Count of 3-stars in the given graph: [9]
