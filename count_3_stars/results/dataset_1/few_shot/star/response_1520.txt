Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 5

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

```
        0 -- 8
        |    |
        9    6
               \
                8
               /  \
             6     0
              \    |
                8  9 
                        
1 -- 3         4 -- 7
|    |         |    |
7    5         1    |
       \         |    |
          9      |    |
                   7
```

To find the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all the 3-stars present. Let's list them below:

<0, (8, 6, 9)>
<1, (3, 7, 5)>
<4, (7, 1, 7)>

After identifying the 3-stars in the graph, we find that there are a total of [3] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
