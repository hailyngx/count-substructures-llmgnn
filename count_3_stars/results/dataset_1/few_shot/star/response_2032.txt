Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 3

Response:
The central node in a 3-star graph must have degree 3, and each of its adjacent nodes must have degree 1. Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- Node 0 is a central node of a 3-star: <0, (1, 4, 8)>
- Node 1 is a central node of a 3-star: <1, (0, 4, 5)>
- Node 3 is a central node of a 3-star: <3, (5, 6, 9)>
- Node 7 is a central node of a 3-star: <7, (1, 6, 8)>

Therefore, there are a total of [4] 3-stars in the graph.
