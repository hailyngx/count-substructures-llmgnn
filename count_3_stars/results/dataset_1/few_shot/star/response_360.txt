Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 8

Response:
Since a 3-star graph consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 1: (2, 4, 7) and (3, 7, 8)
2. Node 2: (1, 4, 7) and (1, 4, 8)
3. Node 4: (2, 1, 7) and (2, 1, 8)
4. Node 7: (1, 4, 6) and (1, 4, 8)
5. Node 8: (1, 4, 9) and (1, 4, 7)

[The number of 3-stars in the given graph is 10.]  
<1, (2, 4, 7)>, <1, (3, 7, 8)>, <2, (1, 4, 7)>, <2, (1, 4, 8)>, <4, (2, 1, 7)>, <4, (2, 1, 8)>, <7, (1, 4, 6)>, <7, (1, 4, 8)>, <8, (1, 4, 9)>, <8, (1, 4, 7)>
