Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 1

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible 3-stars. 

Given edges: 
(0, 7), (0, 9), (1, 2), (1, 5), (1, 7), (1, 8), (1, 9), (2, 1), (2, 6), (3, 5), (3, 8), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 7), (6, 2), (6, 4), (7, 0), (7, 1), (7, 5), (7, 8), (8, 1), (8, 3), (8, 7), (9, 0), (9, 1) 

Based on the adjacency list for each node, we can find the 3-stars as follows:

- Node 1: <1, (2, 5, 7)>
- Node 7: <7, (0, 5, 8)>

Hence, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: 
<1, (2, 5, 7)>
<7, (0, 5, 8)>
