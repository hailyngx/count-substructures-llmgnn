Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 1

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the 3-stars based on the definition provided.

Since a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can search for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars in this graph:
<0, (1, 2, 9)>
<1, (0, 5, 6)>
<3, (4, 5, 6)>
<4, (3, 7, 8)>
<5, (1, 3, _)> (Note: Node 5 is only connected to nodes 1 and 3, it doesn't form a complete 3-star)
<6, (1, 3, 8)>
<8, (1, 4, 6)>
<9, (0, 1, _)>

Since we counted the unique 3-stars in the graph, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [7].
