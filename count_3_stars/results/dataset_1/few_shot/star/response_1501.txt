Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list all such 3-stars:

<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<0, (1, 3, 6)>
<0, (2, 3, 6)>
<0, (2, 5, 6)>
<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<2, (0, 3, 7)>
<2, (0, 7, 5)>
<0, (5, 4, 9)>
<5, (0, 4, 9)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars: [10].
