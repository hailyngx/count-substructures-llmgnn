Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 2

Response:
There are 3 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

1. <0, (3, 5, 7)>
2. <0, (5, 7, 9)>
3. <9, (0, 1, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
