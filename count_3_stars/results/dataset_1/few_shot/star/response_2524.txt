Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 8

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star subgraphs present in the given graph:

1. Nodes (1, 4, 9) form a 3-star. Central node: 1, Leaves: 4, 9
2. Nodes (3, 8, 9) form a 3-star. Central node: 3, Leaves: 8, 9

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].

Unique 3-stars: <1, (4, 9)>, <3, (8, 9)>
