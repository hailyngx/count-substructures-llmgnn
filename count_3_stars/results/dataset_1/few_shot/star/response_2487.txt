Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 6

Response:
There are two 3-stars in the given graph. 

[2]

<2, (0, 6, 8)>
<7, (1, 4, 5)>
