Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars present. 

Based on the definition provided, a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list down the 3-stars:

<0, (2, 7, 8)>
<0, (2, 7, 9)>
<2, (0, 4, 7)>
<2, (0, 7, 8)>
<4, (2, 3, 7)>
<4, (2, 7, 9)>
<7, (0, 2, 3)>
<7, (0, 3, 4)>
<9, (0, 3, 4)>
<9, (0, 4, 9)>

After identifying all the unique 3-stars, we can count the total number of 3-stars in the given graph. 
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is: [10].
