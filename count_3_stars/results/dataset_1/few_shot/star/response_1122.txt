Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. From the adjacency list, we can see that nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, and 9 have degree 3 or more.

2. Let's check each of these nodes to see if they form a 3-star:
    - Node 0 forms a 3-star: <0, (1, 2, 7)>
    - Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (0, 2, 4)>, <1, (0, 6, 7)>, <1, (2, 4, 9)>
    - Node 2 forms a 3-star: <2, (0, 1, 4)>, <2, (0, 4, 9)>
    - Node 4 forms a 3-star: <4, (1, 2, 3)>
    - Node 6 forms a 3-star: <6, (1, 7, 0)>
    - Node 9 forms a 3-star: <9, (1, 2, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 2, 7)>, 
<1, (0, 2, 4)>,
<1, (0, 6, 7)>,
<1, (2, 4, 9)>,
<2, (0, 1, 4)>,
<2, (0, 4, 9)>,
<4, (1, 2, 3)>,
<6, (1, 7, 0)>,
<9, (1, 2, 5)>
