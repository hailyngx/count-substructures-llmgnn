Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find the number of instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a 3-star structure.

Looking at the adjacency list for each node, the 3-stars in this graph can be identified as follows:

<0, (1, 4, 7)>
<1, (0, 4, 8)>
<2, (5, 9,  *no 3-star here*)>
<3, (4, 5, 8)>
<4, (0, 1, 3)>
<5, (2, 3, 4)>
<6, (8, 9,  *no 3-star here*)>
<7, (0,  *no 3-star here*,  *no 3-star here*)>
<8, (1, 3, 6)>
<9, (2, 3, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
