Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges, forming a 3-star pattern.

Observing the adjacency list for each node, we can identify the following 3-star patterns:

<2, (3, 4, 9)>
<5, (3, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
