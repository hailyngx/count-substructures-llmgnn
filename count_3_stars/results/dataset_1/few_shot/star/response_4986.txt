Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 7
