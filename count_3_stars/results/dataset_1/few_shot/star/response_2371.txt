Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the 3-stars. 

From the adjacency list, we can see that the center node must have exactly 3 neighbors. We will analyze each node to see if they form any 3-star configurations.

Analyzing node 0:
Node 0 does not have 3 neighbors, so it cannot be a center of a 3-star.

Analyzing node 1: 
Node 1 has 3 neighbors (4, 7, 9). Thus, node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors 4, 7, and 9. 
<1, (4, 7, 9)>

Analyzing node 2: 
Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it cannot be a center of a 3-star.

Analyzing node 3: 
Node 3 has 3 neighbors (0, 5, 7). Thus, node 3 forms a 3-star with neighbors 0, 5, and 7. 
<3, (0, 5, 7)>

Analyzing node 4: 
Node 4 has 3 neighbors (1, 2, 9). Thus, node 4 forms a 3-star with neighbors 1, 2, and 9. 
<4, (1, 2, 9)>

Analyzing node 5: 
Node 5 has 3 neighbors (2, 3, 7). Thus, node 5 forms a 3-star with neighbors 2, 3, and 7. 
<5, (2, 3, 7)>

Analyzing node 6:
Node 6 does not have 3 neighbors, so it cannot be a center of a 3-star.

Analyzing node 7: 
Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it cannot be a center of a 3-star.

Analyzing node 8:
Node 8 does not have 3 neighbors, so it cannot be a center of a 3-star.

Analyzing node 9: 
Node 9 has 3 neighbors (1, 2, 4). Thus, node 9 forms a 3-star with neighbors 1, 2, and 4. 
<9, (1, 2, 4)>

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are:
<1, (4, 7, 9)>
<3, (0, 5, 7)>
<4, (1, 2, 9)>
<5, (2, 3, 7)>

Count of 3-stars: [4]
