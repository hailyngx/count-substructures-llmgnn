Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 6, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph, we can visually inspect each node and its neighbors to see if they form a 3-star structure. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<1, (7, 2, 6)>
<3, (4, 5, 6)>
<3, (4, 7, 9)>
<3, (5, 3, 6)>
<3, (6, 2, 7)>
<3, (6, 7, 9)>
<4, (3, 7, 8)>
<6, (2, 3, 7)>
<6, (3, 6, 9)>
<7, (1, 2, 9)>
<7, (2, 6, 9)>
<8, (3, 4, 9)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
