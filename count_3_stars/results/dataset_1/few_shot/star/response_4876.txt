Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for central nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

In this case, the potential central nodes are:
- Node 0: Connected to nodes 3, 4, 7 (3 neighbors)
- Node 1: Connected to nodes 2, 4, 7 (3 neighbors)
- Node 2: Connected to nodes 1, 3, 8 (3 neighbors)
- Node 3: Connected to nodes 0, 2, 6 (3 neighbors)
- Node 7: Connected to nodes 0, 1, 4 (3 neighbors)
- Node 8: Connected to nodes 2, 5, 7 (3 neighbors)
- Node 9: Connected to nodes 0, 1, 2 (3 neighbors)

Let's count the unique 3-stars:
- <0, (3, 4, 7)>
- <1, (2, 4, 7)>
- <2, (1, 3, 8)>
- <3, (0, 2, 6)>
- <7, (0, 1, 4)>
- <8, (2, 5, 7)>
- <9, (0, 1, 2)>

Count of 3-stars: [7]
