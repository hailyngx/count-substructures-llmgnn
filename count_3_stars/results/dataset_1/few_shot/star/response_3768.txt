Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 8

Response:
Given the graph information, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. <0, (4, 6, 7)>
2. <3, (4, 6, 7)>
3. <4, (0, 3, 5)>
4. <6, (0, 3, 7)>
5. <8, (1, 6, 9)>
6. <9, (3, 8, 0)>

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
