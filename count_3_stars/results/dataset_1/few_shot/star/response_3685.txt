Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a 3-star pattern.

Looking at the adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<1, (3, 5, 8)>
<4, (0, 5, 8)>
<5, (1, 4, 8)>
<8, (1, 4, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
