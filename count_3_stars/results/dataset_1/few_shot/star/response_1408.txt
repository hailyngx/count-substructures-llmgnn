Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through each node to find the 3-stars:

1. Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 4, and 6: <0, (2, 4, 6)>
2. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 6, and 7: <1, (2, 6, 7)>
3. Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 3, and 5: <4, (0, 3, 5)>
4. Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 4, and 6: <5, (3, 4, 6)>
5. Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 8, 9, and 1: <7, (8, 9, 1)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
