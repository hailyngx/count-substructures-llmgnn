Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 6

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:

[<0, (1, 2, 3)>]

[<0, (1, 2, 6)>, <0, (1, 3, 9)>, <0, (2, 3, 9)>]

[<3, (0, 2, 9)>, <3, (0, 5, 9)>]

[<4, (2, 5, 8)>]

[<7, (1, 8, 3)>]

[<8, (3, 4, 7)>, <8, (4, 7, 8)>]

[<9, (0, 3, 6)>, <9, (0, 6, 4)>, <9, (3, 6, 0)>]

[<3, (0, 9, 6)>]
