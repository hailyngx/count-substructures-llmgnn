Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will represent the centers of the 3-star graphs.

By examining the adjacency list, the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes are:
- Node 0: connected to nodes 2, 3, and 4
- Node 2: connected to nodes 0, 4, and 7
- Node 3: connected to nodes 0, 4, and 5
- Node 7: connected to nodes 2, 3, and 4

Therefore, there are 4 possible 3-star graphs in this given graph.

<b>Final Answer: [4]</b>

<1, (2, 0, 4)>
<2, (0, 4, 7)>
<3, (0, 4, 5)>
<4, (2, 3, 7)>
