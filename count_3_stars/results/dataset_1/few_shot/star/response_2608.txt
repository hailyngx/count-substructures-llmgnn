Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern.

By examining the adjacency list for each node, we can identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
<0, (3, 7, 8)>
<1, (2, 3, 9)>
<3, (0, 1, 8)>
<4, (3, 7, 8)>
<8, (0, 3, 4)>
<9, (1, 5, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
