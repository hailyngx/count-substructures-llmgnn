Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 7
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. We can start by examining each node and its neighbors to see if they form any 3-stars.

Here are the 3-stars found in the given graph:
- <0, (1, 3, 7)>
- <1, (0, 3, 6)>
- <1, (0, 3, 9)>
- <1, (2, 5, 9)>
- <3, (0, 1, 7)>
- <5, (2, 6, 7)>
- <5, (6, 7, 9)>

Now, counting the number of unique 3-stars found, we get a total of [7].
