Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, and node 6

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph. 

To form a 3-star, we need a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. We will look for all such instances. 

1. Node 0: Possible 3-stars = 3
   <0, (1, 5, 9)>
   
2. Node 1: Possible 3-stars = 3
   <1, (0, 2, 9)>
   
3. Node 2: Possible 3-stars = 1
   <2, (1, 8, 9)>
   
4. Node 3: No 3-star possible
   
5. Node 4: No 3-star possible
   
6. Node 5: Possible 3-stars = 1
   <5, (0, 7, 8)>
   
7. Node 6: No 3-star possible
   
8. Node 7: No 3-star possible
   
9. Node 8: No 3-star possible
   
10. Node 9: Possible 3-stars = 3
    <9, (0, 1, 2)>
    <9, (3, 6, 9)>
    <9, (5, 0, 1)>
    
Total number of 3-stars: [8]
Unique 3-stars: <0, (1, 5, 9)> <1, (0, 2, 9)> <2, (1, 8, 9)> <5, (0, 7, 8)> <9, (0, 1, 2)> <9, (3, 6, 9)> <9, (5, 0, 1)>
