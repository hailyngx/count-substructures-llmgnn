Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 7

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are as follows:

<0, (2, 6, 9)>
<1, (5, 7, 9)>
<2, (0, 5, 6)>
<4, (6, 9, 0)>
<5, (1, 2, 6)>
<6, (0, 2, 4)>
<7, (1, 9, 0)> 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
