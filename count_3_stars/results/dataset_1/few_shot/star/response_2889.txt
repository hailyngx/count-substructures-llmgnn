Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars present in the graph. 

Looking at the definition of a 3-star graph, we know that it consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list out the unique 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<0, (1, 4, 7)>
<3, (1, 4, 7)>
<4, (0, 3, 5)>
<4, (0, 5, 9)>
<7, (0, 3, 5)>
<7, (3, 4, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
