Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify the 3-stars.

1. Starting with Node 0:
- <0, (2, 3, 6)>
- <0, (2, 3, 6)>

2. Moving on to Node 1:
- No 3-star can be formed with Node 1.

3. Analyzing Node 2:
- No 3-star can be formed with Node 2.

4. Looking at Node 3:
- <3, (0, 4, 5)>

5. Exploring Node 4:
- No 3-star can be formed with Node 4.

6. Checking Node 5:
- <5, (3, 6, 9)>

7. Considering Node 6:
- <6, (0, 5, 9)>

8. Moving to Node 7:
- No 3-star can be formed with Node 7.

9. Examining Node 8:
- No 3-star can be formed with Node 8.

10. Finally, Node 9:
- No 3-star can be formed with Node 9.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4]. The unique 3-stars found are <0, (2, 3, 6)>, <3, (0, 4, 5)>, <5, (3, 6, 9)>, and <6, (0, 5, 9)>.
