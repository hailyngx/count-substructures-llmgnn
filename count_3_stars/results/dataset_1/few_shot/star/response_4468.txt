Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, which forms a 3-star structure with that node as the center.

Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
- <0, (4, 7, 8)>
- <1, (2, 8, 0)>
- <2, (1, 6, 8)>
- <7, (0, 8, 9)>
- <8, (0, 1, 3)>
- <8, (0, 5, 6)>
- <8, (1, 3, 5)>
- <8, (1, 5, 6)>
- <8, (3, 5, 6)>
- <8, (7, 9, 6)>

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
