Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star (a center node connected to exactly three other nodes) and then count them.

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<0, (1, 8, 9)>
<1, (0, 7, 9)>
<2, (3, 5, 6)>
<2, (5, 7, 6)>
<4, (0, 6, 8)>
<7, (1, 2, 9)>
<8, (0, 4, 9)>
<9, (1, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
