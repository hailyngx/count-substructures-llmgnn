Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify sets of nodes where one node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's start by listing all the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (3, 6, 7)>
<1, (2, 5, 6)>
<1, (5, 8, 9)>
<2, (1, 5, 7)>
<5, (1, 2, 9)>
<6, (0, 1, 3)>

Now, we count the total number of unique 3-stars: [6].
