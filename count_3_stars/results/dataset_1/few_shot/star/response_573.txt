Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 7

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in this graph step by step:

1. Node 0 forms 3-stars with nodes 3, 4, and 6: <0, (3, 4, 6)>
2. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 7, and 9: <1, (6, 7, 9)>
3. Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 7, and 8: <2, (3, 7, 8)>
4. Node 3 forms 3-stars with nodes 0, 2, and 6: <3, (0, 2, 6)>
5. Node 4 does not form any 3-star.
6. Node 5 does not form any 3-star.
7. Node 6 does not form any new 3-stars as they were already counted.
8. Node 7 does not form any 3-star.
9. Node 8 does not form any 3-star.
10. Node 9 does not form any new 3-stars as they were already counted.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is: [4]
The unique 3-stars are: <0, (3, 4, 6)>, <1, (6, 7, 9)>, <2, (3, 7, 8)>, <3, (0, 2, 6)>
