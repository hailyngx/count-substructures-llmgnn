Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, and node 7

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

Here are the unique 3-stars: 
1. <0, (1, 4, 7)>
2. <4, (0, 1, 6)>
3. <7, (0, 3, 5)>
4. <9, (2, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
