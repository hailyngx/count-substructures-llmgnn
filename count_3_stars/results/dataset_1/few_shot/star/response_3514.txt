Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, and node 6

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- The center node 0 does not form a 3-star as it is connected to only one node.
- The center node 1 does not form a 3-star as it is connected to two nodes.
- The center node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 7, and 8: <2, (6, 7, 8)>
- The center node 3 does not form a 3-star as it is connected to three nodes.
- The center node 4 does not form a 3-star as it is connected to only one node.
- The center node 5 does not form a 3-star as it is connected to two nodes.
- The center node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 4, and 9: <6, (2, 4, 9)>
- The center node 7 does not form a 3-star as it is connected to four nodes.
- The center node 8 does not form a 3-star as it is connected to three nodes.
- The center node 9 does not form a 3-star as it is connected to two nodes.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2], and the unique 3-stars found are <2, (6, 7, 8)> and <6, (2, 4, 9)>.
