Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 5, and node 8

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we can see that the nodes with the most connections are node 1 and node 8. 
For node 1:
- One possible 3-star is centered at node 1 with leaves 3, 4, and 6: <1, (3, 4, 6)>
- Another possible 3-star is centered at node 1 with leaves 6, 7, and 8: <1, (6, 7, 8)>

For node 8:
- One possible 3-star is centered at node 8 with leaves 5, 7, and 9: <8, (5, 7, 9)>
- Another possible 3-star is centered at node 8 with leaves 3, 4, and 6: <8, (3, 4, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
