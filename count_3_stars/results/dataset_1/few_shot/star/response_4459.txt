Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, 6, 8, and node 9

Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star configuration.

Based on the definition provided, a 3-star has a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

From the adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-star configurations:
<0, (2, 3, 5)>
<0, (2, 3, 6)>
<0, (2, 3, 8)>
<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<0, (3, 5, 8)>
<0, (3, 6, 8)>
<1, (4, 7, 9)>
<2, (0, 4, 7)>
<3, (0, 5, 6)>
<3, (0, 5, 9)>
<3, (0, 6, 8)>
<3, (4, 5, 9)>
<3, (4, 6, 9)>
<4, (1, 2, 3)>
<5, (0, 3, 6)>
<5, (0, 3, 9)>
<5, (0, 6, 9)>
<6, (0, 3, 5)>
<6, (0, 3, 9)>
<6, (3, 5, 9)>
<7, (1, 2, 5)>
<8, (0, 3, 9)>
<9, (1, 3, 5)>
<9, (1, 3, 6)>
<9, (1, 5, 8)>
<9, (3, 5, 6)>
<9, (3, 5, 8)>
<9, (3, 6, 8)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars based on the identified configurations.
