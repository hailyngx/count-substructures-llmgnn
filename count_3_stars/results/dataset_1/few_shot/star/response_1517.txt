Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 8

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph by identifying the central node and its connected nodes. 

In the given graph, the central node of a 3-star must have exactly 3 neighbors connected to it. 

From the adjacency list:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 1 neighbor.

Therefore, the possible central nodes for 3-stars are: 2, 4, and 8. Let's find the 3-stars for each central node:

For central node 2:
- <2, (0, 3, 5)> 

For central node 4:
- <4, (1, 6, 7)>

For central node 8:
- <8, (1, 4, 9)> 

Thus, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3]. 

<2, (0, 3, 5)>, <4, (1, 6, 7)>, <8, (1, 4, 9)>
