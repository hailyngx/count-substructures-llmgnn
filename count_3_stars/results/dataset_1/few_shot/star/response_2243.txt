Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 5) (8, 0) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 4

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list the 3-stars present in the given graph:
[<0, (2, 6, 8)>]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1].
