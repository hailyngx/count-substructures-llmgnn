Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can follow these steps:
1. Identify all the nodes that have exactly three neighbors.
2. For each of these nodes, count the number of distinct 3-stars centered at them.
3. Compile the unique 3-stars found.

Let's start by identifying the nodes with exactly three neighbors:
- Node 6 has three neighbors: nodes 0, 1, and 4.

Now, let's count the distinct 3-stars centered at Node 6:
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with neighbors 0, 1, and 4: <6, (0, 1, 4)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1].
The unique 3-stars found are: <6, (0, 1, 4)>.
