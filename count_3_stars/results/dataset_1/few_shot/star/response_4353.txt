Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 4, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

- For each node, check if it is the central node of a 3-star by verifying if it has exactly 3 neighboring nodes.
- If a node satisfies the condition, list the 3-star it is a part of.

Here are the 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (2, 6, 7)>
<0, (2, 6, 8)>
<0, (2, 7, 8)>
<2, (0, 6, 7)>
<2, (0, 6, 9)>
<2, (0, 7, 9)>
<2, (6, 7, 9)>
<3, (2, 5, 6)>
<5, (3, 4, 6)>
<5, (3, 6, 8)>
<5, (4, 6, 8)>
<6, (0, 2, 3)>
<6, (0, 5, 8)>
<6, (2, 3, 5)>
<6, (3, 5, 8)>
<8, (0, 5, 7)>
<8, (1, 5, 9)>
<8, (5, 7, 9)>
<9, (1, 2, 5)>

Count of 3-stars: [18]
