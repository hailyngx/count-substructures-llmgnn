Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, and node 8

Response:
The first step is to identify the 3-stars in the graph based on the given information. 
Next, we will count the number of unique 3-stars present in the graph. 

Identified 3-stars: 
- <1, (3, 5, 6)>
- <3, (1, 4, 7)>
- <4, (3, 9, 9)>
- <5, (0, 1, 6)>
- <6, (1, 5, 9)>
- <9, (2, 4, 8)>

Total number of 3-stars: [6]
