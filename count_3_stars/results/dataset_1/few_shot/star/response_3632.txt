Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of nodes where one node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step by step to find these 3-stars:

1. Identify all nodes that have exactly three neighbors:
   - Node 0 has neighbors: 2, 4
   - Node 1 has neighbors: 6, 9
   - Node 4 has neighbors: 0, 2, 3
   - Node 6 has neighbors: 1, 3, 9
   - Node 9 has neighbors: 1, 2, 6

2. Now, let's construct 3-stars with each of the above nodes as the center. The neighbors will form the leaves of the stars.

So, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are:
<0, (2, 4)>
<1, (6, 9)>
<4, (0, 2, 3)>
<6, (1, 3, 9)>
<9, (1, 2, 6)>

Count of 3-stars in the graph: [5]
