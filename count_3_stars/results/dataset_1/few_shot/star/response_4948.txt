Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 4, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify each unique combination of a center node and its three leaf nodes. 

Here are the 3-stars present in the given graph:
<0, (2, 3, 7)>
<0, (2, 3, 8)>
<0, (2, 3, 9)>
<0, (2, 7, 9)>
<0, (3, 7, 9)>
<2, (0, 3, 4)>
<2, (0, 3, 8)>
<2, (0, 3, 9)>
<4, (1, 3, 6)>
<4, (1, 3, 8)>
<4, (1, 3, 9)>
<4, (1, 4, 6)>
<4, (1, 4, 8)>
<4, (2, 3, 8)>
<4, (2, 3, 9)>
<4, (2, 8, 9)>
<4, (6, 1, 3)>
<8, (0, 4, 9)>
<8, (2, 4, 9)>
<8, (3, 4, 9)>
<9, (0, 2, 3)>
<9, (0, 2, 7)>
<9, (0, 2, 8)>
<9, (0, 3, 7)>

Count of 3-stars in the graph: [24]
