Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique configuration of a 3-star in the graph.

Looking at the definition of a 3-star graph, we know that each 3-star has a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<1, (3, 4, 6)>
<1, (3, 6, 9)>
<1, (4, 6, 9)>
<3, (1, 8, 9)>
<6, (1, 5, 8)>
<8, (3, 5, 9)>

Count of 3-stars: [6]
