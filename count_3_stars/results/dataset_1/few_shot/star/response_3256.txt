Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, which forms a 3-star pattern. 

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<1, (0, 5, 7)>
<2, (3, 7, 9)>
<3, (0, 2, 8)>
<4, (0, 5, 6)>
<5, (1, 4, 9)>
<7, (1, 2, 9)>
<8, (1, 3)>
<9, (1, 5, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
