Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify all the 3-stars present in the graph:

<1, (2, 3, 6)>
<1, (2, 3, 7)>
<1, (2, 7, 9)>
<1, (3, 1, 7)>
<1, (6, 1, 7)>
<1, (7, 2, 9)>
<2, (1, 7, 9)>
<3, (1, 8, 6)>
<3, (8, 9, 7)>
<6, (1, 8, 7)>
<7, (1, 2, 9)>
<8, (0, 3, 6)>
<8, (0, 3, 9)>
<8, (3, 6, 9)>
<8, (6, 1, 7)>
<8, (6, 9, 7)>
<8, (9, 2, 7)>
<9, (2, 7, 8)>

Count = [18]
