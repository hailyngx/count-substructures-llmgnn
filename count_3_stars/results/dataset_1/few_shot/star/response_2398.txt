Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 5) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 5

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:

[<0, (1, 6, 7)>, <1, (0, 3, 4)>, <5, (2, 3, 9)>]

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
