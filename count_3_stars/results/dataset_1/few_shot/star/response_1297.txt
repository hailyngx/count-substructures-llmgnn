Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes (forming a 3-star pattern).

Let's list the 3-stars we find:
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<1, (0, 2, 5)>
<2, (0, 1, 5)>
<3, (0, 7, 9)>
<4, (8, 9, 7)>
<5, (1, 2, 6)>
<6, (1, 5, 2)>
<7, (1, 3, 9)>
<8, (1, 4, 5)>
<9, (4, 7, 8)>

Count of 3-stars: [10]
