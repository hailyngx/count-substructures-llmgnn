Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 1
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we first identify the central nodes of potential 3-stars. Since a 3-star has a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we look for nodes that have exactly three edges. 

By examining the adjacency list, we find that nodes 2 and 3 satisfy this criterion. 

Next, we check the neighbors of nodes 2 and 3 to see if there are any 3-stars centered at these nodes:

For node 2:
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 5 and 6. 
- Nodes 5 and 6 are also connected to each other and to node 7. 
- So, we have a 3-star centered at node 2 with leaves 5, 6, and 7. 
- <2, (5, 6, 7)>

For node 3:
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 5 and 7. 
- Node 5 is also connected to nodes 2 and 6, which violates the 3-star condition since node 5 has more than three neighbors.
- Therefore, there are no 3-stars centered at node 3.

Count of 3-stars in the given graph: [1]
Unique 3-stars: <2, (5, 6, 7)>
