Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (3, 7) (4, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 7
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 6, and node 7

Response:
Given the provided information, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (1, 2, 7)>
<1, (0, 7, 8)>
<7, (0, 1, 3)>
<7, (0, 1, 4)>
<9, (6, 7, 9)>

Total number of 3-stars in the graph: [5]
