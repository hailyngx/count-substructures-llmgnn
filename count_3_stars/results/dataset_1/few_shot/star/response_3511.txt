Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we will look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will act as the centers of 3-stars in the graph.

From the adjacency list given:
- Node 0 has 3 connections: 1, 4, 7
- Node 4 has 4 connections: 0, 5, 6, 9
- Node 7 has 3 connections: 0, 2, 8

Therefore, the 3-stars in the graph can be formed by using the above nodes as centers. Let's calculate the number of unique 3-stars below:

Number of 3-stars = [3] 
<0, (1, 4, 7)>
<4, (0, 5, 6)>
<7, (0, 2, 8)>
