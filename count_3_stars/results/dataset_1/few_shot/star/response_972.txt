Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 7
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
There are 3-star configurations in the given graph. Let's find and list them step-by-step:

Step 1: Identify the central node and its adjacent nodes.
- Node 0: Adjacent nodes are 1 and 5.
  <0, (1, 5)>
  
- Node 1: Adjacent nodes are 0, 2, 3, and 8.
  <1, (0, 2, 3)>
  <1, (0, 8)>
  
- Node 2: Adjacent nodes are 1 and 5.
  <2, (1, 5)>
  
- Node 3: Adjacent nodes are 1 and 5.
  <3, (1, 5)>
  
- Node 5: Adjacent nodes are 0, 2, 3, and 8.
  <5, (0, 2, 3)>
  <5, (0, 8)>

Step 2: Count the unique 3-stars found in Step 1.
