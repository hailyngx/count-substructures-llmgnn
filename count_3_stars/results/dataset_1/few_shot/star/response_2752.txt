Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 5) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 2

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify groups of nodes that form 3-stars. Remember that a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Looking at the graph and the given adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<1, (0, 3, 7)>
<2, (3, 9)>
<3, (1, 2, 7)>
<4, (0, 1)>
<7, (0, 1, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [6].
