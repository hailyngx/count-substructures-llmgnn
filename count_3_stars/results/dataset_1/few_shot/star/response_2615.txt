Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Looking at the graph information provided, we can identify the following unique 3-stars:
1. <0, (4, 6, 7)>
2. <0, (4, 7, 9)>
3. <0, (6, 7, 9)>
4. <2, (1, 5, 6)>
5. <2, (1, 5, 8)>
6. <2, (1, 6, 8)>
7. <2, (1, 6, 5)>
8. <2, (5, 6, 8)>
9. <2, (5, 6, 1)>
10. <2, (5, 8, 1)>
11. <2, (5, 8, 6)>
12. <2, (6, 8, 1)>
13. <2, (6, 5, 1)>
14. <2, (6, 5, 8)>
15. <2, (8, 1, 6)>
16. <2, (8, 1, 5)>
17. <2, (8, 5, 1)>
18. <2, (8, 5, 6)>
19. <3, (4, 8, 9)>
20. <4, (0, 5, 9)>
21. <4, (0, 5, 6)>
22. <4, (0, 6, 9)>
23. <4, (3, 5, 9)>
24. <4, (3, 5, 8)>
25. <4, (3, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [25].
