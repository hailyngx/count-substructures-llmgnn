Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 6
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- Node 0 forms a 3-star with leaves 1, 4, 5: <0, (1, 4, 5)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with leaves 0, 8, but it's already counted above.
- Node 2 does not form any 3-star as it is only connected to two other nodes.
- Node 3 does not form any 3-star as it is only connected to two other nodes.
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with leaves 0, 5, 8: <4, (0, 5, 8)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with leaves 0, 4, 6: <5, (0, 4, 6)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with leaves 0, 4, 8: <6, (0, 4, 8)>
- Node 7 does not form any 3-star as it is only connected to two other nodes.
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with leaves 1, 4, 6: <8, (1, 4, 6)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
