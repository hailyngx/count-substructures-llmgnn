Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

By looking at the adjacency list of each node, we can identify the following 3-stars in the graph:

[5]
<0, (2, 3, 6)>
<1, (4, 5, 7)>
<2, (0, 5, 3)>
<3, (0, 5, 2)>
<4, (1, 7, 5)>
<5, (1, 2, 3)>
<6, (0, 8, 0)>
<7, (1, 9, 4)>
<8, (6, 0, 0)>
<9, (7, 0, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
