Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars present in the graph. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

From the given graph, the nodes with their connections can be visualized as follows:
- 0: 3, 7, 9
- 1: 4, 7
- 2: 3, 6, 7, 8, 9
- 3: 0, 2, 6
- 4: 1, 5, 7, 8, 9
- 5: 4, 8
- 6: 2, 3
- 7: 0, 1, 2, 4
- 8: 2, 4, 5
- 9: 0, 2, 4

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- <0, (3, 7, 9)>
- <2, (3, 6, 7)>
- <2, (3, 8, 9)>
- <4, (5, 8, 9)>
- <4, (1, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5]. 
Here are the unique 3-stars found: <0, (3, 7, 9)>, <2, (3, 6, 7)>, <2, (3, 8, 9)>, <4, (5, 8, 9)>, <4, (1, 7, 9)>.
