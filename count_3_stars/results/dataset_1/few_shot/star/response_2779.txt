Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 2) (4, 8) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 8
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 8

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be calculated by counting the number of 3-stars centered at each node.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: 0 3-stars
- Node 1: 2 3-stars (<1, (0, 8, 9)>, <1, (7, 8, 9)>)
- Node 2: 0 3-stars
- Node 3: 0 3-stars
- Node 4: 0 3-stars
- Node 5: 0 3-stars
- Node 6: 0 3-stars
- Node 7: 0 3-stars
- Node 8: 3 3-stars (<8, (1, 4, 9)>, <8, (1, 9, 4)>, <8, (4, 9, 1)>)
- Node 9: 1 3-star (<9, (1, 8, 9)>)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph: [6]
The unique 3-stars found are: <1, (0, 8, 9)>, <1, (7, 8, 9)>, <8, (1, 4, 9)>, <8, (1, 9, 4)>, <8, (4, 9, 1)>, <9, (1, 8, 9)>
