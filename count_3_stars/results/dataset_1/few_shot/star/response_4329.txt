Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Identify nodes with exactly three neighbors:
   - Node 0 has 5 neighbors (1, 2, 3, 5, 9).
   - Node 1 has 3 neighbors (0, 6, 7).
   - Node 2 has 4 neighbors (0, 4, 6, 9).
   - Node 5 has 3 neighbors (0, 6, 8).
   - Node 6 has 4 neighbors (1, 2, 5, 7).
   - Node 7 has 3 neighbors (1, 6, 9).

2. For each node with 3 neighbors, check if it forms a 3-star:
   - For Node 1: (0, 1, 6), (1, 6, 7) (In total, 2 possible 3-stars)
   - For Node 5: (0, 5, 6) (1 possible 3-star)
   - For Node 7: (1, 6, 7) (1 possible 3-star)

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
  
Unique 3-stars found:
<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<0, (5, 6, 8)>
