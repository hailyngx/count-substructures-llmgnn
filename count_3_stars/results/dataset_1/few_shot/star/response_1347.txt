Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Let's find all the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<0, (1, 3, 7)>
<0, (2, 3, 7)>
<3, (0, 2, 5)>
<3, (0, 4, 7)>
<3, (2, 5, 7)>
<7, (0, 3, 5)>
<7, (0, 5, 8)>
<7, (3, 5, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
