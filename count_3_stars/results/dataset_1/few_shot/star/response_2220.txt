Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8)

Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique occurrence of a 3-star, which consists of a central node and three connected nodes.

Let's analyze the graph step by step:

1. Identify potential central nodes with exactly 3 neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 7, and Node 2 are central nodes with 3 neighbors.

2. For each potential central node, confirm if the neighbors form a 3-star:
- Check Node 0: Neighbors are {2, 3, 4, 6}. No 3-star is formed as it has more than 3 neighbors.
- Check Node 7: Only connected to Node 1. Not a central node for a 3-star.
- Check Node 2: Neighbors are {0, 8}. No 3-star is formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Hence, there are no 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [0].
