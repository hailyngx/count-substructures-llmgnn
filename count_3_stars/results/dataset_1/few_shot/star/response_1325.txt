Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, and node 8

Response:
Given the information provided, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (8, 9)>
<1, (2, 4, 5)>
<2, (1, 5, 9)>
<4, (1, 6, 9)>
<8, (0, 9)>
<9, (0, 2, 8)>

Counting the number of 3-stars, we get a total of [6].
