Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all possible 3-stars.

We look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will be the centers of 3-stars in the graph. Then we identify the three nodes that are connected to the center node in each 3-star.

Let's list the unique 3-stars that form in the graph:

<3, (0, 4, 5)>
<4, (3, 5, 6)>
<7, (4, 5, 9)>
<8, (3, 4, 7)>
<9, (1, 3, 7)>

Count of 3-stars in the graph: [5]
