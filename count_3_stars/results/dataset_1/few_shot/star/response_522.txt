Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (2, 0) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes form the centers of 3-stars. Let's go through the nodes one by one:

Node 0 has 4 connections, which makes it a potential center for a 3-star. Let's check its neighbors:
- <0, (2, 4, 6)>
- <0, (2, 4, 8)>
- <0, (2, 6, 8)>
- <0, (4, 6, 8)>

Node 4 also has 4 connections, so it's another potential center for a 3-star. Let's check its neighbors:
- <4, (0, 3, 8)>
- <4, (0, 8, 3)>
- <4, (3, 8, 0)>

Node 8 has 4 connections as well. Checking its neighbors:
- <8, (0, 4, 7)>
- <8, (0, 7, 4)>
- <8, (4, 7, 0)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9]. The unique 3-stars are <0, (2, 4, 6)>, <0, (2, 4, 8)>, <0, (4, 6, 8)>, <4, (0, 3, 8)>, <8, (0, 4, 7)>.
