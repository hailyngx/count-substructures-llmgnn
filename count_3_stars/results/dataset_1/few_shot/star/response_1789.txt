Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 7

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 3, 7)>
<0, (1, 7, 8)>
<6, (2, 5, 7)>
<7, (4, 8, 9)>
