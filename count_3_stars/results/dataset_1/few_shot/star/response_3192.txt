Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 6
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6, and node 7

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that can act as the center of a 3-star in this graph. Nodes with degree 3 can act as centers because they are connected to exactly three other nodes. In this graph, nodes 1, 2, 6, and 8 have a degree of 3.

Now, let's consider each of these nodes as potential centers and check the edges to find 3-stars around them.

For node 1:
- <1, (0, 2, 3)>
- <1, (2, 6, 8)>
- <1, (3, 2, 8)>

For node 2:
- <2, (1, 3, 7)>
- <2, (3, 6, 7)>
- <2, (6, 1, 7)>

For node 6:
- <6, (2, 3, 9)>
- <6, (3, 2, 9)>
- <6, (8, 7, 9)>

For node 8:
- <8, (1, 6, 7)>
- <8, (6, 1, 7)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: <1, (0, 2, 3)>, <1, (2, 6, 8)>, <1, (3, 2, 8)>, <2, (1, 3, 7)>, <2, (3, 6, 7)>, <2, (6, 1, 7)>, <6, (2, 3, 9)>, <6, (3, 2, 9)>, <6, (8, 7, 9)>, <8, (1, 6, 7)>.
