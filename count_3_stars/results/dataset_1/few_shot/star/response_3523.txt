Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the nodes that act as the center of a 3-star and the other nodes that are connected to this center. A 3-star has the center node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Based on the adjacency list and the provided edges, we can identify the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<1, (0, 3, 6)>
<2, (0, 3, 6)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<3, (5, 7, 9)>
<4, (1, 7, 8)>
<5, (3, 7, 8)>
<5, (3, 7, 9)>
<6, (1, 2, 7)>
<7, (1, 3, 4)>
<7, (1, 3, 5)>
<8, (3, 4, 5)>
<9, (3, 5, 7)>

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
