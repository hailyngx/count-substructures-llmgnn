Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

The nodes connected to exactly three other nodes are: 
- Node 0 (connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, and 8)
- Node 2 (connected to nodes 0, 3, 6, and 8)
- Node 7 (connected to nodes 5, 6, and 9)
- Node 8 (connected to nodes 0, 2, and 9)
- Node 9 (connected to nodes 4, 7, and 8)

So, there are 5 instances of 3-stars in this graph.

<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<2, (0, 3, 6)>
<9, (4, 7, 8)>
<7, (5, 6, 9)>
<8, (0, 2, 9)>
