Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for every possible 3-star configuration. 

Now, let's list out the unique 3-stars present in the given graph:

<0, (4, 7, 9)>
<1, (3, 8, 9)>
<3, (1, 4, 9)>
<4, (0, 3, 7)>
<5, (2, 6, 8)>
<7, (0, 4, 9)>
<8, (1, 5, 9)>
<9, (3, 7, 8)>

Count of 3-stars in the given graph: [8]
