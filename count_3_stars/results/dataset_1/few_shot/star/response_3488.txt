Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 6

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (4, 9)>
<1, (7, 8, 9)>
<2, (5, 6, 9)>
<3, (4, 7)>
<4, (0, 3, 8)>
<6, (2, 9)>
<7, (1, 3)>

Therefore, there are a total of [7] 3-stars in the graph.
