Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 8

Response:
Let's determine the number of 3-stars in the given graph by following these steps:

1. Identify the nodes that have three edges connected to them. These nodes will act as the center of each 3-star. In this graph, nodes 0, 1, and 2 meet this criterion.

2. For each of these central nodes, identify the nodes that are connected to it. These nodes will form the leaves of the 3-stars.

3. Count the total number of unique 3-stars that can be formed using the identified central nodes and leaves.

Based on the information provided, the 3-stars in the given graph are:
<0, (6, 7, 9)>
<1, (2, 3, 7)>
<2, (1, 4, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
