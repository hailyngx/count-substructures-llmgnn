Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph based on the definition provided. Each 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Given the adjacency list, we can find the 3-stars by examining each node and its neighbors. Here are the 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<0, (2, 3, 6)>
<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<2, (0, 3, 5)>
<2, (0, 3, 7)>
<2, (3, 5, 7)>
<3, (0, 2, 7)>
<4, (0, 1, 7)>
<5, (2, 6, 7)>
<7, (2, 4, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
