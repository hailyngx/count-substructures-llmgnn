Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star in the graph. 

Let's examine each node in the graph and determine if it serves as the center of a 3-star with three leaves connected to it. 

Starting with Node 0:
- Node 0 has branches to nodes 1, 2, 4, and 8. There is a 3-star centered at Node 0:
<0, (1, 4, 8)>

Moving on to Node 1:
- Node 1 has branches to nodes 0, 3, 4, 5, and 6. There is a 3-star centered at Node 1:
<1, (0, 4, 5)>
- There is no other 3-star centered at Node 1 as the remaining connections do not form a valid 3-star.

Next, Node 2:
- Node 2 has branches to nodes 0, 3, 7, and 9. There is a 3-star centered at Node 2:
<2, (0, 3, 9)>

Proceeding to Node 3:
- Node 3 has branches to nodes 1 and 2. As there are not enough connections for a 3-star, Node 3 does not form any 3-star.

Moving on to Node 4:
- Node 4 has branches to nodes 0, 1, and 9. There is a 3-star centered at Node 4:
<4, (0, 1, 9)>

Proceeding to Node 5:
- Node 5 has branches to nodes 1 and 8. As there are not enough connections for a 3-star, Node 5 does not form any 3-star.

Next, Node 6:
- Node 6 has branches to nodes 1 and 8. As there are not enough connections for a 3-star, Node 6 does not form any 3-star.

Moving on to Node 7:
- Node 7 has a branch to Node 2. As there are not enough connections for a 3-star, Node 7 does not form any 3-star.

Proceeding to Node 8:
- Node 8 has branches to nodes 0, 5, 6, and 9. There is a 3-star centered at Node 8:
<8, (0, 5, 9)>

Finally, Node 9:
- Node 9 has branches to nodes 2, 4, and 8. There is a 3-star centered at Node 9:
<9, (2, 4, 8)>

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in the given graph are:
<0, (1, 4, 8)>
<1, (0, 4, 5)>
<2, (0, 3, 9)>
<4, (0, 1, 9)>
<8, (0, 5, 9)>
<9, (2, 4, 8)>

Thus, there are a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
