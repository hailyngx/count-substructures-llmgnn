Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 9
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 1

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes in a star-like pattern with a center node and three leaves.

From the given information, the nodes connected to exactly three other nodes are:
- Node 0: connected to nodes 1, 4, 5, and 7
- Node 1: connected to nodes 0, 4, and 9
- Node 5: connected to nodes 0, 6, and 7
- Node 7: connected to nodes 0, 3, 5, and 6

Let's list the unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<1, (0, 4, 9)>
<5, (0, 6, 7)>
<7, (0, 3, 5)>
<7, (0, 5, 6)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
