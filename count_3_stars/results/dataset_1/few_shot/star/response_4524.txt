Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 4

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

The total number of 3-stars can be calculated based on the number of nodes connected to each node. Since a 3-star involves a center node connected to exactly 3 other nodes, we can find the number of 3-stars by counting the possible combinations of 3 other nodes connected to each node as the center.

Here are the 3-stars in the graph:
<1, (2, 3, 7)>
<3, (0, 1, 6)>
<3, (1, 6, 8)>
<3, (0, 1, 9)>
<3, (4, 7, 9)>
<7, (1, 4, 8)>
<7, (1, 5, 8)>
<7, (1, 4, 5)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
