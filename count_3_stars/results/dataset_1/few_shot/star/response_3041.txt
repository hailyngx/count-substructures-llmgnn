Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 5

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star subgraphs in the given graph, where each subgraph consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes.

We can find the 3-star subgraphs by looking for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through each node in the graph:

- Node 0 is connected to 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, and 9 (6 connections).
- Node 1 is connected to 2, 7, and 9 (3 connections).
- Node 2 is connected to 0 and 1 (2 connections).
- Node 3 is connected to 0, 4, 7, and 9 (4 connections).
- Node 4 is connected to 0, 3, and 6 (3 connections).
- Node 5 is connected to 8 and 9 (2 connections).
- Node 6 is connected to 0 and 4 (2 connections).
- Node 7 is connected to 0, 1, and 3 (3 connections).
- Node 8 is connected to 5 (1 connection).
- Node 9 is connected to 0, 1, 3, and 5 (4 connections).

From the analysis above, we found the following 3-star subgraphs:
<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<0, (3, 4, 6)>
<0, (4, 6, 7)>
<0, (6, 7, 9)>
<0, (7, 9, 1)>
<1, (7, 9, 3)>
<3, (0, 9, 5)>
<5, (9, 0, 1)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
