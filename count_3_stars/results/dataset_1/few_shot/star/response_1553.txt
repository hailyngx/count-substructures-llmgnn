Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star configuration in the graph.

Let's list down the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<1, (6, 7, 8)>
<1, (6, 7, 9)>
<1, (6, 8, 9)>
<1, (7, 8, 9)>
<4, (6, 7, 9)>
<7, (1, 4, 9)>
<9, (1, 4, 7)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars found, we get:

[7]
