Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 0
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 7

Response:
Let's identify all the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (3, 6, 8)>
<1, (5, 7, 9)>
<6, (0, 7, 9)>
<7, (1, 6, 8)>
<9, (5, 6, 7)>

Therefore, there are [5] 3-stars in the graph.
