Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star, which consists of a center node connected to three leaf nodes. Let's go through the nodes one by one:

1. Node 0: Connected to nodes 3, 4, 5, and 7.
   - <0, (3, 4, 5)>
2. Node 1: Connected to nodes 6 and 8.
   - <1, (6, 8)>
3. Node 2: Connected to nodes 4 and 5.
   - <2, (4, 5)>
4. Node 3: Connected to node 0.
   - No 3-star here.
5. Node 4: Connected to nodes 0, 2, 5, and 6.
   - <4, (0, 2, 5)>
6. Node 5: Connected to nodes 0, 2, and 4.
   - <5, (0, 2, 4)>
7. Node 6: Connected to nodes 1, 4, and 8.
   - <6, (1, 4, 8)>
8. Node 7: Connected to node 0.
   - No 3-star here.
9. Node 8: Connected to nodes 1 and 6.
   - No 3-star here.
10. Node 9: Not connected to any other nodes.
   - No 3-star here.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are <0, (3, 4, 5)>, <1, (6, 8)>, <2, (4, 5)>, <4, (0, 2, 5)>, and <5, (0, 2, 4)>. 
Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
