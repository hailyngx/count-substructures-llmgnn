Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Inspecting the given graph, we find the following 3-stars:
<0, (1, 3, 8)>
<1, (0, 4, 6)>
<3, (0, 2, 8)>
<4, (1, 5, 6)>
<5, (4, 6, 7)>
<6, (1, 4, 7)>
<7, (5, 6, 8)>
<8, (0, 1, 3)>
<9, (7, 8)>

Count of 3-stars in the given graph: [9]
