Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be calculated by observing that each 3-star is uniquely defined by its center node. Since there can only be one 3-star centered at each node, we can simply count the number of nodes in the graph and consider them as the centers of potential 3-stars.

In this case, there are 10 nodes in the graph. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<1, (0, 2, 6)>
<2, (1, 8, -)>
<3, (5, -, -)>
<4, (7, -, -)>
<5, (0, 3, 7)>
<6, (1, 8, -)>
<7, (4, 5, 8)>
<8, (1, 2, 5)>
<9, (-, -, -)>

Therefore, the final answer is: [10].
