Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5

Response:
Based on the provided information, the graph can be visually represented as follows:

```
      2----3
     /     |
    /      |
   6---4   |
    \  /   |
     1 --- 5---9
    /|   /|

        /
       0
```

To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify the central node and its three connected nodes. Let's go through each node and their connections to find the 3-stars:

- For node 0: (0, 1, 5), <0, (1, 5, 8)>.
- For node 1: (1, 0, 5), <1, (0, 5, 2)>.
- For node 2: (2, 1, 6), <2, (1, 6, 3)>.
- For node 3: No 3-star as it has less than 3 connections.
- For node 4: No 3-star as it has less than 3 connections.
- For node 5: (5, 0, 1), <5, (0, 1, 7)>, <5, (1, 7, 9)>.
- For node 6: (6, 2, 4), <6, (2, 4, 1)>.
- For node 7: No 3-star as it has less than 3 connections.
- For node 8: No 3-star as it has less than 3 connections.
- For node 9: No 3-star as it has less than 3 connections.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
The unique 3-stars found:
<0, (1, 5, 8)>, <1, (0, 5, 2)>, <5, (0, 1, 7)>, <5, (1, 7, 9)>.
