Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Let's analyze the connections for each node:

- Node 0: Not part of any 3-star.
- Node 1: Not part of any 3-star.
- Node 2: <2, (1, 7, 8)> (3-star centered at node 2)
- Node 3: Not part of any 3-star.
- Node 4: Not part of any 3-star.
- Node 5: Not part of any 3-star.
- Node 6: <6, (3, 5, 7)> (3-star centered at node 6)
- Node 7: Not part of any 3-star.
- Node 8: <8, (1, 3, 7)> (3-star centered at node 8)
- Node 9: Not part of any 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: <2, (1, 7, 8)> and <6, (3, 5, 7)>.
