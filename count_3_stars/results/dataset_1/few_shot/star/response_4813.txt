Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 4

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 7. Thus, <2, (0, 4, 7)> is a 3-star.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 7. Thus, <4, (0, 2, 7)> is another 3-star.
- Since the center and leaves of a 3-star are distinct, we have found all the 3-stars in this graph.

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph: [2]. 

Therefore, the final answer is [2].
