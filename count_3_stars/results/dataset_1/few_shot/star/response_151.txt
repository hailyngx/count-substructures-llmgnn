Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 8) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Upon examining the graph, we can identify the following 3-stars:
- <5, (0, 3, 9)>
- <8, (1, 2, 7)>
- <9, (3, 5, 6)>
- <9, (5, 8, 6)>
- <9, (3, 5, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
