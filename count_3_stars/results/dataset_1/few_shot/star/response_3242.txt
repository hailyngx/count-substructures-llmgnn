Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to understand that a 3-star is represented by a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we see that:
- Node 0 is a central node of a 3-star with leaves 4, 5, and 9.
- Node 1 is a central node of a 3-star with leaves 2, 5, and 6.
- Node 4 is a central node of a 3-star with leaves 0, 7, 8, and 9.
- Node 5 is a central node of a 3-star with leaves 0, 1, and 9.
- Node 6 is a central node of a 3-star with leaves 1, 3, and 9.
- Node 7 is a central node of a 3-star with leaves 3, 4, 8, and 9.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the graph are:
<0, (4,5,9)>, <1, (2,5,6)>, <4, (0,7,8,9)>, <5, (0,1,9)>, <6, (1,3,9)>, <7, (3,4,8,9)>.

Counting these unique 3-stars, we find that there are [6] 3-stars in total.
