Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 3

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are as follows:
<0, (6, 7, 1)>
<1, (2, 6, 0)>
<2, (1, 3, 6)>
<3, (2, 4, 5)>
<4, (3, 7, 0)>
<5, (3, 6, 7)>
<6, (0, 1, 2)>
<7, (0, 4, 5)>

There are a total of [8] 3-stars in the graph.
