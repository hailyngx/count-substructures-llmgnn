Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 5, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all possible 3-stars.

Based on the definition of a 3-star graph, each 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. We'll iterate through each node in the graph and check if the node forms a 3-star. If it does, we'll list it.

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the given graph:
<0, (1, 6, 9)>
<1, (0, 4, 9)>
<2, (3, 5, -)>
<4, (1, 3, 9)>
<3, (2, 4, 5)>
<6, (0, 3, 5)>
<5, (2, 3, 6)>
<7, (5, 9, -)>
<9, (0, 3, 4)>

Now, we count the total number of 3-stars by counting the unique combinations listed above. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
