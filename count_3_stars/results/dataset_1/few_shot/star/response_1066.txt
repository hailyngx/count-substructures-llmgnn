- 22 edges

The 3-star graph consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph step by step.

1. Identify all nodes with exactly three edges connected:
- Nodes: 4, 6, 7, 9

2. Check if these nodes form a 3-star:
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 7, and 9. 
    Possible 3-stars involving node 4: 
    - <4, (5, 6, 7)>
    - <4, (5, 6, 9)>
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 7, and 9.
    Possible 3-stars involving node 6: 
    - <6, (1, 4, 7)>
    - <6, (1, 4, 9)>
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 6, 8, and 9.
    Possible 3-stars involving node 7: 
    - <7, (4, 6, 8)>
    - <7, (4, 6, 9)>

3. Calculate the total number of 3-stars: 
- Total 3-stars: [3]

4. List of unique 3-stars:
- <4, (5, 6, 7)>
- <4, (5, 6, 9)>
- <6, (1, 4, 7)>
- <6, (1, 4, 9)>
- <7, (4, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the output is: [3], with the unique 3-stars listed above.
