Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Here are the 3-stars present in the graph:

[4]

Unique 3-stars: 
<0, (5, 9, 1)>
<3, (2, 5, 8)>
