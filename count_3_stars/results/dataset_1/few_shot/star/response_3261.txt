Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify sets of nodes that form 3-stars. A 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's analyze the graph and identify the 3-stars in it:

1. From the given edges and adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars:
   - <0, (1, 4, 9)>
   - <1, (0, 3, 9)>
   - <7, (3, 5, 6)>
   - <9, (1, 4, 8)>

Counting the unique 3-stars found:
