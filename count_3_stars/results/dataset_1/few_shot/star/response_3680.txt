Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star-like pattern. 

After analyzing the given graph, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (4, 5, 9)>
<2, (1, 4, 5)>
<2, (4, 5, 7)>
<3, (4, 5, 9)>
<4, (0, 2, 3)>
<5, (0, 2, 3)>
<7, (2, 3, 9)>
<9, (0, 2, 3)>

Now, counting the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph gives us [8].
