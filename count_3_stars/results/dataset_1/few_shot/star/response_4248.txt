Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 8

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

There is one 3-star centered at node 1 with leaves 2, 7, and 8. (1, (2, 7, 8))
There is one 3-star centered at node 5 with leaves 0, 6, and 8. (5, (0, 6, 8))

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: <1, (2, 7, 8)>, <5, (0, 6, 8)>.
