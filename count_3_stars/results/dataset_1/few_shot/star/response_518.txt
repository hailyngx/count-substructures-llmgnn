Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 9) (4, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 6
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern. A 3-star pattern consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

We can start by looking at each node and its neighbors to see if any of them form a 3-star pattern.

Upon examining the graph and the given information, we can identify the following 3-star patterns:

<0, (7, 8)>
<1, (6, 8)>
<2, (9, 3)>
<4, (6, 5)>
<6, (1, 4)>
<7, (0, 8)>
<8, (0, 1)>
<9, (2, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
