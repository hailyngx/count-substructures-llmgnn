Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 5

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (2, 8, 6)>
<1, (3, 7, 6)>
<2, (0, 4, 6)>
