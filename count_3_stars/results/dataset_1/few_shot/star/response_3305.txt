Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 7, and node 8

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique occurrences where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

By examining the adjacency list provided, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:
1. <0, (7, 8, 9)>
2. <1, (8, 9, 0)>
3. <2, (4, 6, 7)>
4. <4, (2, 5, 7)>
5. <7, (0, 2, 4)>
6. <8, (0, 1, 9)>
7. <9, (1, 3, 7)>

Therefore, there are a total of [7] 3-stars in the given graph.
