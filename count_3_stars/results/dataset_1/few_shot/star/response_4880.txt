Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 4

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern, which consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the adjacency list for each node:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, and 7: <0, (1, 3, 7)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 2, and 7: <1, (0, 2, 7)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 4, and 8: <2, (1, 4, 8)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 2, and 9: <4, (1, 2, 9)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 7, and 8: <6, (5, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
