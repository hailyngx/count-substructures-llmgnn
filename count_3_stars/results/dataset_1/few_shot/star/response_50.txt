Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 3) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the set of 3-stars based on the definition provided (center node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges).

Analyzing the graph based on the adjacency list and the given edges, we can identify the 3-stars as follows:
- <0, (1, 3, 5)>
- <1, (0, 3, 4)>
- <3, (0, 1, 6)>
- <8, (1, 2, 9)>
- <9, (0, 4, 8)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
