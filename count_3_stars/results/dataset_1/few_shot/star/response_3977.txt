Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (2, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 3

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's list them step by step.

Node 0 is not part of any 3-star.
Node 1 is not part of any 3-star.
Node 2 is not part of any 3-star.
Node 3 is part of a 3-star: <3, (5, 6, 8)>
Node 4 is not part of any 3-star.
Node 5 is part of two 3-stars: <3, (5, 7, 8)> and <5, (3, 7, 8)>
Node 6 is not part of any 3-star.
Node 7 is not part of any 3-star.
Node 8 is part of two 3-stars: <3, (5, 6, 8)> and <5, (3, 7, 8)>
Node 9 is not part of any 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4] and they are:
<3, (5, 6, 8)>
<3, (5, 7, 8)>
<5, (3, 7, 8)>
