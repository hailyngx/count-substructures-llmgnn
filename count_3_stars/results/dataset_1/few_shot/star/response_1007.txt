Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 2

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes to form a 3-star pattern.

Looking at the adjacency information, we can identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 6, and 9
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 7
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, and 4

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. <0, (1, 5, 6)>
2. <0, (1, 5, 9)>
3. <0, (1, 6, 9)>
4. <5, (0, 3, 7)>
5. <6, (0, 1, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
