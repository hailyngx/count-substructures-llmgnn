Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify each 3-star pattern. Recall that a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Looking at the graph, we can identify the following 3-stars:

<0, (1, 2, 7)>
<0, (1, 8, 7)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<1, (0, 3, 5)>
<1, (0, 4, 5)>
<2, (0, 6, 3)>
<2, (0, 6, 4)>
<2, (0, 6, 5)>
<3, (1, 6, 4)>
<3, (1, 6, 5)>
<4, (1, 6, 5)>
<5, (1, 6, 4)>
<6, (2, 3, 4)>
<6, (2, 3, 5)>
<6, (2, 4, 5)>
<7, (0, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [17].
