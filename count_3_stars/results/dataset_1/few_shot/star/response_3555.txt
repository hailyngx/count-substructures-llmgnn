Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 3

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that has exactly 3 neighbors and count that as a 3-star with the node as the central node. Let's identify all the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 3 is a central node of a 3-star: (3, 7, 8, 9)
- Node 7 is a central node of three 3-stars: (7, 3, 4, 5), (7, 4, 5, 6), (7, 3, 6, 8)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [**4**].

<3, (7, 8, 9)>
<7, (3, 4, 5)>
<7, (4, 5, 6)>
<7, (3, 6, 8)>
