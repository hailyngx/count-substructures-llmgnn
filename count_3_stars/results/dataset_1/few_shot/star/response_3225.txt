Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, and node 7

Response:
The task is to count the number of 3-stars in the given graph. 

To find a 3-star, we need to identify a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's analyze the graph:

- Node 0 is not part of any 3-star because it is connected to only two nodes.
- Node 1 is part of a 3-star (1, 4, 6, 7) as it is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 7.
- Node 2 is not part of any 3-star as it is not connected to any other node.
- Node 3 is not part of any 3-star because it is connected to only one node.
- Node 4 is part of a 3-star (1, 4, 6, 9) as it is connected to nodes 1, 6, and 9.
- Node 5 is not part of any 3-star because it is connected to only one node.
- Node 6 is part of a 3-star (1, 4, 6, 9) as it is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 9.
- Node 7 is part of a 3-star (1, 4, 7, 9) as it is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 9.
- Node 8 is not part of any 3-star because it is connected to only one node.
- Node 9 is not part of any 3-star because it is connected to four nodes.

We found three unique 3-stars in the graph: 
<1, (4, 6, 7)>
<4, (1, 6, 9)>
<7, (1, 4, 9)>

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
