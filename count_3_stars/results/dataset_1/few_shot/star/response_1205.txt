Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star pattern, which consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

In this graph, a 3-star can be formed when a node is connected to three other nodes and each of those nodes is not connected to each other. 

Let's identify the unique 3-star patterns:
<0, (2, 5, 7)>
<2, (0, 7, 8)>
<6, (1, 4, 9)>
<7, (0, 4, 9)>

Count of 3-stars: [4]
