Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that has exactly three neighbors. A 3-star is formed by a central node and three other nodes that are connected to the central node. 

Identifying nodes with exactly three neighbors:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors
- Node 1 has 1 neighbor
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors
- Node 3 has 1 neighbor
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<4, (3, 6, 9)>
<5, (0, 6, 7)>
<7, (5, 6, 8)>
<8, (1, 7, 9)>

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
