Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 7

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

From the given information, we can see that there are 4 nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes: nodes 1, 3, 6, and 9. 

Let's analyze each of these nodes one by one:

1. Node 1:
   Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 8. This forms a 3-star with node 1 as the central node and nodes 2, 5, and 8 as the leaves. 
   <1, (2, 5, 8)>

2. Node 3:
   Node 3 is connected to nodes 6, 7, and 9. This forms a 3-star with node 3 as the central node and nodes 6, 7, and 9 as the leaves.
   <3, (6, 7, 9)>

3. Node 6:
   Node 6 is connected to nodes 3 and 8. However, it does not form a 3-star since it is not connected to exactly three other nodes.

4. Node 9:
   Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 7. This forms a 3-star with node 9 as the central node and nodes 0, 3, and 7 as the leaves.
   <9, (0, 3, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: <<1, (2, 5, 8)>, <3, (6, 7, 9)>>.
