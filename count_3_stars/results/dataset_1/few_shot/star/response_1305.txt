Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, let's first identify the 3-stars and then count them.

Given the definition of a 3-star, we need to find nodes with exactly 3 neighbors (leaves) connected to the same node (center).

Based on the adjacency list provided, the nodes with exactly 3 neighbors are:
- Node 1: Connected to nodes 2 and 4
- Node 3: Connected to nodes 2 and 5
- Node 7: Connected to nodes 4, 8, and 9

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<1, (2, 4, 5)>
<3, (2, 5, 8)>
<7, (4, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
