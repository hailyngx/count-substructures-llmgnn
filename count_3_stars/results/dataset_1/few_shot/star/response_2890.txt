Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible 3-stars. 

From the given information about the graph:
- Node 0 forms 3-stars with nodes 1, 2, 3
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 0 and 7
- Node 3 forms 3-stars with nodes 0 and 1

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in this graph are:
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<2, (0, 7)>
<3, (0, 1)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
