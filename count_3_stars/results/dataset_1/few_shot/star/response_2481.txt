Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern.

Let's first identify the 3-stars in the graph:

<2, (0, 1, 4)>
<4, (1, 2, 9)>
<6, (3, 7, 8)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph by summing up the unique instances:
