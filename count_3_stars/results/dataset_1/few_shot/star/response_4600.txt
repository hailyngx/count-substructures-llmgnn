Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes (forming a 3-star pattern with that node as the center). 

After analyzing the given graph, we can see that there are 3 instances of 3-stars:

<0, (3, 5, 8)>
<3, (0, 4, 9)>
<7, (1, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3]. 

The unique 3-stars are listed below:
<0, (3, 5, 8)>
<3, (0, 4, 9)>
<7, (1, 6, 8)>
