Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 44 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars. 

From the edge list and adjacency list, we can see that the nodes {0, 2, 4, 8} form a 3-star around node 0. There are no other 3-stars in this graph.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1], and the unique 3-star is <0, (2, 4, 8)>.
