Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 8

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph step by step:

1. For each node, identify the neighbors it is connected to.

- Node 0: 3
- Node 1: 3, 5, 8
- Node 2: 3, 6, 7, 9
- Node 3: 0, 1, 2, 5, 7, 8
- Node 4: 6
- Node 5: 1, 3, 7
- Node 6: 2, 4, 9
- Node 7: 2, 3, 5
- Node 8: 1, 3, 9
- Node 9: 2, 6, 8

2. Identify the 3-stars:

- <1, (3, 5, 8)>
- <3, (1, 5, 7)>
- <2, (3, 6, 9)>
