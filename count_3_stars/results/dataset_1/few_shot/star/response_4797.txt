Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0

Response:
The given graph contains the following 3-stars:

<0, (1, 9, -)>
<1, (0, -, -)>
<2, (5, 8, -)>
<3, (5, 6, -)>
<4, (5, -, -)>
<5, (2, 3, 4)>
<6, (3, -, -)>
<7, (5, -, -)>
<8, (2, 5, -)>
<9, (0, -, -)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
