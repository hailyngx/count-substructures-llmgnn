Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 8
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 6

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 1 is connected to nodes 3 and 4, forming a 3-star with node 1 as the center and nodes 3, 4 as the leaves. <1, (3, 4)>
2. Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 8, forming a 3-star with node 4 as the center and nodes 1, 2, 8 as the leaves. <4, (1, 2, 8)>
3. Node 8 is connected to nodes 4 and 7, forming a 3-star with node 8 as the center and nodes 4, 7 as the leaves. <8, (4, 7)>
