Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 2

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can identify the 3-stars by looking for nodes with exactly three neighbors forming 3 edges. Here are the steps to find the number of 3-stars:

1. Identify nodes with 3 edges each:
   - Node 7 has 4 neighbors (2, 4, 5, 6), so it does not form a 3-star.
   - Node 2 has 3 neighbors (3, 7, 9), so it forms a 3-star.
   - Node 4 has 4 neighbors (1, 3, 7, 8), so it does not form a 3-star.
   - Node 8 has 3 neighbors (0, 3, 4), so it forms a 3-star.

2. Once we have identified nodes that form 3-stars, we can count the unique 3-stars:
   - <2, (3, 7, 9)>
   - <8, (0, 3, 4)>

[The number of 3-stars in the given graph is 2.]
