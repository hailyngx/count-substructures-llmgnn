Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 6

Response:
First, we can identify the 3-stars using the given information.

Let's list the 3-star configurations with the central node first, followed by the three connected nodes:

<0, (2, 3, 7)>
<1, (6, 7, 9)>
<2, (0, 4, X)> (No third node connected to 2, doesn't form a 3-star)
<3, (0, 4, 5)>
<4, (2, 3, 9)>
<5, (3, X, X)> (Only one edge connected to 5, doesn't form a 3-star)
<6, (1, 7, 9)>
<7, (0, 1, 6)>
<8, (6, X, X)> (Only one edge connected to 8, doesn't form a 3-star)
<9, (1, 3, 4)>

Therefore, there are a total of [7] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 3, 7)>
<1, (6, 7, 9)>
<3, (0, 4, 5)>
<4, (2, 3, 9)>
<6, (1, 7, 9)>
<7, (0, 1, 6)>
<9, (1, 3, 4)>
