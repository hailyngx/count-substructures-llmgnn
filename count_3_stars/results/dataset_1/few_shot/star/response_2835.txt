Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph, we need to find all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Given the information provided, the possible 3-star graphs are centered around nodes 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 because they each have exactly 3 edges connecting them to other nodes.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<2, (0, 5, 6)>
<3, (1, 7, 5)>
<5, (2, 7, 7)>
<7, (2, 3, 5)>
<8, (7, 9, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
