Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 8

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a 3-star pattern.

From the adjacency list, we can see that the potential central nodes would be nodes: 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8. Let's check each of these nodes to see if they are indeed the centers of any 3-stars.

So let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

<2, (4, 5, 6)>
<5, (2, 4, 7)>
<6, (1, 2, 7)>
<7, (0, 5, 8)>
<8, (6, 7, 9)>

[The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 5.]
