Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 3

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

The central node of a 3-star must have degree 3. In this graph, the only node with degree 3 is node 1. So, node 1 will be the central node of all the 3-stars we find.

Now let's list the 3-stars:

<1, (0, 5, 6)>
<1, (0, 7, 8)>
<1, (2, 3, 7)>
<1, (3, 5, 6)>
<1, (3, 7, 9)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
