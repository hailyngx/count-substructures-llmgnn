Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 8

Response:
First, let's find all the 3-stars in the given graph. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we can see that the nodes with exactly three connections (leaves) are: Node 0, Node 2, Node 5, and Node 7. 

Let's explore the 3-star configurations for each of these nodes:
- For Node 0: (0, 3, 5), (0, 3, 6), (0, 3, 8), (0, 5, 6), (0, 5, 8), (0, 6, 8)
- For Node 2: (2, 4, 9)
- For Node 5: (5, 0, 6)
- For Node 7: (7, 3, 4)

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the graph are:
<0, (3, 5, 6)>, <0, (3, 6, 8)>, <0, (5, 6, 8)>, <2, (4, 9)>, <5, (0, 6)>, <7, (3, 4)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars gives us [6].
