Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. We can identify these 3-stars by looking for nodes that have exactly three edges incident on them.

Looking at the adjacency list for each node, we can determine that the 3-stars in this graph are as follows:

<0, (4, 5, 7)>
<1, (5, 7, 8)>
<2, (1, 5, 9)>
<3, (6, 7, [])>
<4, (0, 6, 9)>
<5, (0, 1, [])>
<6, (1, 3, [])>
<7, (0, 1, [])>
<8, (0, 1, [])>
<9, (1, 4, [])>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
