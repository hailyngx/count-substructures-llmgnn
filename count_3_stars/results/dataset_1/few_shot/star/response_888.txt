Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the provided adjacency list:
- Node 0 is a center of a 3-star with leaves 2, 3, and 7
- Node 2 is a center of two 3-stars: (2, 0, 3) and (2, 4, 7)
- Node 3 is a center of two 3-stars: (3, 0, 2) and (3, 4, 6)
- Node 4 is a center of two 3-stars: (4, 1, 9) and (4, 2, 5)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7]. 

<0, (2, 3, 7)>
<2, (0, 3, 4)>
<2, (4, 7, 8)>
<3, (0, 2, 6)>
<3, (4, 6, 9)>
<4, (1, 9, 5)>
<4, (2, 5, 7)>
