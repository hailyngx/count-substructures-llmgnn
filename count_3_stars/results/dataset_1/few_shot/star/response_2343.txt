Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 6
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 6

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the 3-stars present. 

Let's list all the 3-stars found in the graph:
<1, (5, 8, 9)>
<6, (2, 4, 8)>
<8, (1, 5, 6)>
<9, (1, 6, 0)> 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
