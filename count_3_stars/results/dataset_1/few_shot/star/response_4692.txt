Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 4, and node 8

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the given graph:
- Node 0 is a 3-star: <0, (3, 4, 5)>
- Node 4 is a 3-star: <4, (0, 1, 2)>
- Node 9 is a 3-star: <9, (0, 2, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 3. 
So, the final answer is [3].
