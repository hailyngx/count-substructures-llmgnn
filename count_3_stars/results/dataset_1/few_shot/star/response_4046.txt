Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 7, and node 8

Response:
The unique 3-stars in the given graph are:
<1, (2, 3, 4)>
<1, (4, 6, 9)>
<2, (1, 3, 4)>
<4, (1, 7, 9)>
<7, (4, 5, 9)>
<8, (4, 5, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
