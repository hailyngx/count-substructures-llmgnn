Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 5) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 5
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 5, and node 6

Response:
First, let's identify which nodes can be the center nodes of 3-stars. A center node must have exactly 3 edges, connecting it to 3 other nodes.

Nodes that meet this criteria: node 0, node 5, and node 4.

Now, let's find the 3-stars using each of these potential center nodes:

For node 0:
- <0, (4, 5, 7)>
- Total: 1

For node 5:
- <5, (0, 1, 9)>
- Total: 1

For node 4:
- <4, (0, 3, 7)>
- Total: 1

[Total number of 3-stars: 3]
