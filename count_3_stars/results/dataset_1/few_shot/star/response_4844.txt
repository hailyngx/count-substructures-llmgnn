Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 8) (2, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 1) (6, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 2

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify sets of nodes where one node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the given graph:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 6, and 9
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 5, and 8
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 8 and 9
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1 and 7
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 7

We can see that nodes 0, 1, 6 and node 0, 1, 9 form two 3-stars in this graph.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].

Unique 3-stars found: 
<0, (1, 6, 9)>
<1, (0, 4, 5)>
<1, (2, 4, 7)>
<1, (2, 8, 7)>
