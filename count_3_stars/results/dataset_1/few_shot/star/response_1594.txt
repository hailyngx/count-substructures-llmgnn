Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will identify the central node and its adjacent nodes for each 3-star. A 3-star is formed when the central node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (2, 5, 9)>
<2, (0, 5, 6)>
<3, (0, 6, 7)>
<4, (1, 6, 7)>
<5, (0, 6, 9)>
<6, (2, 3, 4)>
<7, (3, 4, 5)>
<8, (6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
