Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 7

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph:

<0, (7, 8, 9)>
<2, (4, 7, 8)>
<4, (1, 2, 8)>
<7, (0, 2, 8)>
<8, (0, 2, 4)>

[Number of 3-star graphs: 5]
