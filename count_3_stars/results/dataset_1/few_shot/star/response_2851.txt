Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 3

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars and list them uniquely, let's identify each 3-star in the graph:

1. Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 5, and 6: <0, (3, 5, 6)>
2. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 6, and 7: <1, (4, 6, 7)>
3. Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 4, and 7: <2, (5, 4, 7)>
4. Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 4, and 9: <3, (0, 4, 9)>
5. Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 0, and 7: <5, (4, 0, 7)>
6. Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 0, and 7: <6, (4, 0, 7)>
7. Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 2, and 6: <7, (4, 2, 6)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
