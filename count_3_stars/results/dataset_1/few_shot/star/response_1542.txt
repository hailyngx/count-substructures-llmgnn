Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 0: No 3-stars as it is not connected to exactly three other nodes.
2. Node 1: No 3-stars as it is not connected to exactly three other nodes.
3. Node 2: <2, (5, 4, 9)>
4. Node 3: No 3-stars as it is not connected to any other nodes.
5. Node 4: No 3-stars as it is not connected to exactly three other nodes.
6. Node 5: No 3-stars as it is connected to four other nodes.
7. Node 6: <6, (5, 7, 9)> 
8. Node 7: No 3-stars as it is connected to four other nodes.
9. Node 8: No 3-stars as it is not connected to exactly three other nodes.
10. Node 9: No 3-stars as it is not connected to exactly three other nodes.

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<2, (5, 4, 9)>
<6, (5, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
