Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes (forming a 3-star pattern). Here's the step-by-step process to find and count the unique 3-stars:

1. Identify the nodes connected to exactly three other nodes:
   - Node 0: Connected to 2 nodes (not a 3-star)
   - Node 1: Connected to 5 nodes (1, 5, 7, 8, 9)
   - Node 2: Connected to 4 nodes (1, 3, 5, 6)
   - Node 3: Connected to 5 nodes (0, 2, 4, 5, 8)
   - Node 4: Connected to 1 node (not a 3-star)
   - Node 5: Connected to 4 nodes (1, 2, 3, 9)
   - Node 6: Connected to 1 node (not a 3-star)
   - Node 7: Connected to 1 node (not a 3-star)
   - Node 8: Connected to 4 nodes (0, 1, 3, 9)
   - Node 9: Connected to 3 nodes (1, 5, 8)

2. From the analysis above, we find the following unique 3-star patterns:
   - <1, (5, 8, 9)>
   - <3, (0, 2, 8)>
   - <5, (1, 2, 9)>

3. Counting the total number of unique 3-stars found: [3]

Therefore, the final answer is [3].
