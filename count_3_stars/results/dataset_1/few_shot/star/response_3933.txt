Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify all possible 3-stars in the graph. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.
2. For each node in the graph, check if it forms a 3-star with its neighbors.

Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. For Node 0:
    - <0, (1, 5, 6)>

2. For Node 1:
    - <1, (0, 2, 7)>
    - <1, (0, 2, 8)>

3. For Node 2:
    - <2, (0, 1, 3)>

4. For Node 3:
    - <3, (2, 4, 8)>

5. For Node 4:
    - <4, (3, 6, 8)>

6. For Node 5:
    - No 3-star can be formed with Node 5.

7. For Node 6:
    - <6, (0, 4, 9)>

8. For Node 7:
    - No 3-star can be formed with Node 7.

9. For Node 8:
    - <8, (1, 3, 4)>
    - <8, (1, 3, 9)>
    - <8, (1, 4, 9)>

10. For Node 9:
    - No 3-star can be formed with Node 9.

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<1, (0, 2, 7)>
<1, (0, 2, 8)>
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<3, (2, 4, 8)>
<4, (3, 6, 8)>
<6, (0, 4, 9)>
<8, (1, 3, 4)>
<8, (1, 3, 9)>
<8, (1, 4, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
