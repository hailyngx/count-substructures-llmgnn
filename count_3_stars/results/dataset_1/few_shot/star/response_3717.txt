Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 4

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are as follows:
<0, (6, 8, 9)>
<2, (3, 4, 7)>
<3, (2, 6, 7)>
<4, (2, 8, 9)>
<6, (0, 3, 5)>
<7, (4, 6, 8)>
<8, (0, 4, 7)>
<9, (0, 4, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
