Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 6

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 

Looking at the adjacency list for each node, we can see that only nodes 1, 5, and 8 have degree 3, meaning they are the potential center nodes of 3-stars. 

Next, let's examine each of these potential center nodes:
- For node 1: (1, 4, 6), (1, 6, 9), (1, 7, 0) are the possible 3-stars.
- For node 5: (5, 6, 9), (5, 8, 1) are the possible 3-stars.
- For node 8: (8, 1, 6), (8, 5, 9) are the possible 3-stars.

Counting the unique 3-stars we found, we get a total of [6] 3-stars. 

Unique 3-stars: 
<1, (4, 6, 9)>
<1, (7, 0, 6)>
<5, (6, 9, 8)>
<5, (8, 1, 6)>
<8, (1, 6, 5)>
<8, (5, 9, 6)>
