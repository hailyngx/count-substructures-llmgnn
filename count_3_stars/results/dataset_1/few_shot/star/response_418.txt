Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 6

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- Node 2 can form one 3-star with leaves 4, 5, and 6: <2, (4, 5, 6)>
- Node 3 can form one 3-star with leaves 4, 5, and 8: <3, (4, 5, 8)>
- Node 4 can form one 3-star with leaves 2, 3, and 5: <4, (2, 3, 5)>
- Node 5 can form one 3-star with leaves 2, 3, and 4: <5, (2, 3, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
