Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the central nodes and their corresponding leaves. 

The central nodes in a 3-star have a degree of 3 in this graph. Let's list the central nodes and their leaves:

1. Central Node 0:
   Leaves: 2, 4, 5

2. Central Node 2:
   Leaves: 0, 5, 6

3. Central Node 4:
   Leaves: 0, 6, 8

4. Central Node 6:
   Leaves: 0, 2, 4

Now, let's count the 3-stars using the identified central nodes and leaves:

1. <0, (2, 4, 5)>
2. <2, (0, 5, 6)>
3. <4, (0, 6, 8)>
4. <6, (0, 2, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
