Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the adjacency list and the provided edges, we can identify the following 3-star structures:
<2, (3, 4, 5)>
<3, (1, 2, 4)>
<4, (0, 2, 3)>
<6, (1, 7, 9)>
<9, (4, 6, 8)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars found, we get a total of [5].
