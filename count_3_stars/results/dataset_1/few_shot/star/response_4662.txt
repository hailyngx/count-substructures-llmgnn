Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we can look for each node that has exactly 3 neighbors and see if it forms a 3-star around that node.

From the given adjacency list, the nodes that have exactly 3 neighbors are nodes 0, 2, 3, and 5.

Let's examine each of these nodes:

3-star centered at node 0:
<0, (1, 6, 0)>

3-star centered at node 2:
<2, (4, 9, 2)>

3-star centered at node 3:
<3, (8, 3, 3)>

3-star centered at node 5:
<5, (4, 9, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
