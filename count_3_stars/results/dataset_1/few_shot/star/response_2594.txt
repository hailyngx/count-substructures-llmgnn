Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 4

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are as follows:
<1, (2, 6, 3)>
<3, (2, 5, 6)>
<6, (1, 3, 8)>
<7, (5, 8, 8)>
<8, (6, 7, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
