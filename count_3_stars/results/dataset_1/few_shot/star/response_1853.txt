Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes such that those three nodes are not connected to each other. These instances represent 3-stars in the graph.

Looking at the given adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars:

<0, (2, 6, 9)>
<3, (0, 4, 8)>
<4, (6, 7, 8)>
<8, (3, 4, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
