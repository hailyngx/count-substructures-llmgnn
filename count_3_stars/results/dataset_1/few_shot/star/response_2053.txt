Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star and then count them.

Let's list down the 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (2, 9, 1)>
<1, (4, 5, 9)>
<2, (4, 5, 6)>
<3, (5, 6, 7)>
<4, (1, 2, 5)>
<5, (1, 2, 3)>
<6, (2, 3, 7)>
<7, (3, 6, 9)>
<8, (3, 6, 0)>
<9, (1, 5, 7)>

Count of 3-stars: [10]
