Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the possible 3-stars in the graph. 

Let's start by listing the 3-stars in the graph: 

<0, (7, 6, 8)>  
<2, (4, 5, 9)>  
<3, (6, 5, 8)>  

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph: [3].
