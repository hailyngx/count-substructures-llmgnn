Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 2

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- Node 0: Not a part of any 3-star.
- Node 1: Not a part of any 3-star.
- Node 2: <2, (1, 5, 9)>
- Node 3: Not a part of any 3-star.
- Node 4: Not a part of any 3-star.
- Node 5: <5, (2, 8, -)>
- Node 6: Not a part of any 3-star.
- Node 7: Not a part of any 3-star.
- Node 8: <8, (3, 5, 6)>
- Node 9: Not a part of any 3-star.

Count of 3-stars: [2]
Unique 3-stars: <<2, (1, 5, 9)>, <5, (2, 8, -)>>
