Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 8

Response:
Starting from node 0:
- <0, (3, 5, 7)>
From node 1:
- <1, (2, 7, 9)>
From node 2:
- <2, (1, 7, 0)>
From node 3:
- <3, (0, 6, 8)>
From node 4:
- No 3-star found.
From node 5:
- No 3-star found.
From node 6:
- <6, (3, 4, 9)>
From node 7:
- No 3-star found.
From node 8:
- No 3-star found.
From node 9:
- No 3-star found.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
