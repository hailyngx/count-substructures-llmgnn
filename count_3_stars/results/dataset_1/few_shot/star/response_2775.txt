Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible 3-stars. 

From the adjacency list, we can observe that the central node for a 3-star can be any node from 0 to 9. 
For each node, we need to identify its neighboring nodes and check if there is a 3-star centered at this node.

Let's break it down by checking each node:

1. **Node 0**: Neighbors are 1, 4, and 8
    - Considering node 1: (0, 1, 4), (0, 1, 8)
    - No 3-star centered at node 0.

2. **Node 1**: Neighbors are 0, 2, 6, 7, and 9
    - Considering node 0: (1, 0, 4), (1, 0, 9)
    - Considering node 2: (1, 2, 6), (1, 2, 7), (1, 2, 9)
    - Considering node 6: (1, 6, 8)
    - No 3-star centered at node 1.

3. **Node 2**: Neighbors are 1, 5, 6, and 7
    - Considering node 1: (2, 1, 7)
    - Considering node 6: (2, 6, 7)
    - No 3-star centered at node 2.

4. **Node 3**: Neighbors are 7 and 9
    - No 3-star centered at node 3.

5. **Node 4**: Neighbors are 0, 5, and 8
    - Considering node 0: (4, 0, 1), (4, 0, 8)
    - Considering node 5: (4, 5, 6), (4, 5, 8)
    - No 3-star centered at node 4.

6. **Node 5**: Neighbors are 2, 4, 6, and 8
    - Considering node 4: (5, 4, 0), (5, 4, 8)
    - Considering node 6: (5, 6, 1), (5, 6, 8)
    - No 3-star centered at node 5.

7. **Node 6**: Neighbors are 1, 2, 5, 7, and 8
    - Considering node 1: (6, 1, 7), (6, 1, 9)
    - Considering node 7: (6, 7, 9)
    - No 3-star centered at node 6.

8. **Node 7**: Neighbors are 1, 2, 3, 6, and 9
    - Considering node 1: (7, 1, 9)
    - Considering node 9: (7, 9, 1)
    - No 3-star centered at node 7.

9. **Node 8**: Neighbors are 0, 4, 5, 6, and 9
    - Considering node 0: (8, 0, 1), (8, 0, 9)
    - Considering node 5: (8, 5, 4), (8, 5, 6), (8, 5, 9)
    - Considering node 6: (8, 6, 1), (8, 6, 7), (8, 6, 9)
    - Considering node 9: (8, 9, 1)
    - No 3-star centered at node 8.

10. **Node 9**: Neighbors are 1, 3, 7, and 8
    - Considering node 1: (9, 1, 0), (9, 1, 7)
    - Considering node 7: (9, 7, 1)
    - Considering node 8: (9, 8, 0)
    - No 3-star centered at node 9.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is 0.
