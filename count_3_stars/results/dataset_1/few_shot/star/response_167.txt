Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 8
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 3

Response:
Given the graph information, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 0 forms a 3-star <0, (2, 4, 7)>
2. Node 1 forms a 3-star <1, (2, 5, 7)>
3. Node 2 forms a 3-star <2, (0, 1, 8)>
4. Node 4 forms a 3-star <4, (0, 5, 7)>
5. Node 5 forms a 3-star <5, (1, 4, 8)>
6. Node 7 forms two 3-stars <7, (0, 1, 8)> and <7, (3, 4, 8)>
7. Node 8 forms a 3-star <8, (2, 3, 5)>

Counting the unique 3-stars indicated above, we get a total of [7] 3-stars in the given graph.
