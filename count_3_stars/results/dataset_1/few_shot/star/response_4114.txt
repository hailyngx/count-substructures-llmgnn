Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to understand that a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

In this graph, we look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, forming 3-stars. 

Let's list down the 3-stars found in this graph:
<0, (3, 8, 9)>
<1, (2, 3, 6)>
<3, (0, 1, 8)>
<4, (3, 5, 6)>
<6, (1, 4, 9)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars: [5]
