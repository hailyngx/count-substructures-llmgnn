Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 8

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes to form a 3-star pattern.

Looking at the graph description, we can identify the 3-stars as follows:
<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<1, (3, 5, 7)>
<1, (4, 6, 7)>
<1, (5, 6, 8)>
<1, (6, 4, 5)>
<7, (0, 1, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
