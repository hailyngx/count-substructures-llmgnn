Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 3

Response:
Based on the given graph and information, the number of 3-stars can be counted as follows:

Let's start by identifying 3-stars based on the definition provided. In this case, a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Looking at the adjacency list of each node, we can identify the 3-stars by considering each node as the center and its connected nodes as the leaves. 

Here is a breakdown of the 3-stars in this graph:

1. Node 0: (1, 3, 4)
2. Node 1: (0, 2, 5)
3. Node 2: (1, 6, 9)
4. Node 3: (0, 5, 9)
5. Node 4: (0, 6, 7)
6. Node 5: (1, 3)
7. Node 6: (1, 2, 4) and (6, 7, 8)
8. Node 7: (2, 4, 6) and (7, 6, 8)
9. Node 8: (6, 7)
10. Node 9: (2, 3)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].

Unique 3-stars: 
<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<1, (0, 2, 5)>
<2, (1, 6, 9)>
<3, (0, 5, 9)>
<4, (0, 6, 7)>
<6, (1, 2, 4)>
<6, (6, 7, 8)>
<7, (2, 4, 6)>
<7, (7, 6, 8)>
