Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 0

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<u>3-stars:</u>
<0, (1, 7, 9)>
<1, (0, 5, 7)>
<5, (1, 6, 7)>
<7, (0, 1, 5)>
<8, (2, 3, 4)>
