Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 5
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all the 3-stars present. 

To form a 3-star, we need one central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list the 3-stars in the graph:

<1, (0, 2, 5)>
<1, (0, 4, 6)>
<1, (2, 5, 6)>
<1, (5, 6, 8)>
<5, (1, 2, 6)>
<5, (1, 6, 7)>
<5, (2, 6, 7)>
<5, (6, 7, 8)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars: [8]
