Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 8

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0 forms a 3-star with leaves 1, 6, and 8. <0, (1, 6, 8)>
2. Node 1 forms a 3-star with leaves 0, 2, and 8. <1, (0, 2, 8)>
3. Node 2 forms a 3-star with leaves 1, 6, and 9. <2, (1, 6, 9)>
4. Node 6 forms two 3-stars:
   - With leaves 0, 2, and 4. <6, (0, 2, 4)>
   - With leaves 4, 7, and 8. <6, (4, 7, 8)>
5. Node 8 forms a 3-star with leaves 0, 4, and 9. <8, (0, 4, 9)>

Therefore, there are a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
