Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can identify each unique 3-star and then count them. 

The unique 3-stars in the provided graph are:
<0, (4, 7, 8)>
<0, (4, 7, 9)>
<0, (4, 8, 9)>
<0, (7, 8, 9)>
<3, (2, 5, 8)>
<3, (2, 8, 9)>
<3, (5, 8, 9)>
<7, (0, 4, 8)>
<7, (0, 4, 9)>
<7, (0, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 3, 5)>
<8, (0, 3, 7)>
<8, (0, 5, 7)>
<8, (2, 3, 5)>
<8, (2, 3, 7)>
<8, (2, 5, 7)>
<8, (3, 5, 7)>
<9, (0, 3, 4)>
<9, (0, 3, 7)>
<9, (0, 4, 7)>
<9, (3, 4, 7)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we find that there are a total of [21] 3-stars in the given graph.
