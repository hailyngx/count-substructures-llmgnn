Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list the 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<5, (0, 2, 6)>
<6, (0, 4, 5)>
<4, (5, 6, 8)>
<8, (4, 9, 9)>
<9, (6, 8, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
