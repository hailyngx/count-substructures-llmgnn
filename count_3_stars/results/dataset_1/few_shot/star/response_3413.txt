Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes (forming a 3-star pattern). 

Here are the 3-stars found in the given graph:
<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<1, (0, 3, 5)>
<2, (7, 8, 9)>
<3, (0, 1, 5)>
<4, (0, 1, 7)>
<5, (1, 3, 7)>
<6, (8, 9)>
<7, (0, 1, 4)>
<8, (2, 3, 7)>
<9, (2, 5, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
