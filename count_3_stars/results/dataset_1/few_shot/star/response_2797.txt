Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will look for each node that satisfies the definition of a 3-star, which is a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Based on the given graph:
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 3, forming a 3-star: <2, (0, 1, 3)>
- Node 2 is also connected to nodes 6, 7, and 8, forming another 3-star: <2, (6, 7, 8)>
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 8, forming a 3-star: <5, (0, 4, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
