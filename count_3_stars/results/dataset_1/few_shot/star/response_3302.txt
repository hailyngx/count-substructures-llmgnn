Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars. 

Let's find all the 3-stars:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1 and 5:
   <0, (1, 5)>

2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0 and 2:
   <1, (0, 2)>

3. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 3:
   <5, (0, 2, 3)>

4. Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 5, and 8:
   <2, (1, 4, 5)>
   <2, (1, 5, 8)>

5. Node 3 is connected to nodes 5 and 9:
   <3, (5, 9)>

6. Node 9 is connected to nodes 3, 6, and 8:
   <9, (3, 6, 8)>

7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 5 and 9:
   <6, (5, 9)>

From the identified 3-stars above:
