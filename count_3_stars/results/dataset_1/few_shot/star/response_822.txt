Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 8

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that can act as the center of a 3-star in this graph. 
Looking at the adjacency list, nodes 1, 7, 8, and 9 have degree 4, which makes them potential centers for 3-stars.

Next, we will check each of these potential centers to see how many 3-stars they are a part of.

For center node 1:
- <1, (0, 3, 7)>
- <1, (0, 4, 8)>
- <1, (2, 8, 7)>
[3-stars with 1 as the center: 3]

For center node 7:
- <7, (0, 1, 8)>
- <7, (0, 9, 8)>
- <7, (1, 3, 8)>
[3-stars with 7 as the center: 3]

For center node 8:
- <8, (1, 7, 9)>
- <8, (1, 2, 9)>
- <8, (7, 9, 4)>
[3-stars with 8 as the center: 3]

For center node 9:
- <9, (4, 8, 7)>
[3-stars with 9 as the center: 1]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10]. 
The unique 3-stars found are <1, (0, 3, 7)>, <1, (0, 4, 8)>, <1, (2, 8, 7)>, <7, (0, 1, 8)>, <7, (0, 9, 8)>, <7, (1, 3, 8)>, <8, (1, 7, 9)>, <8, (1, 2, 9)>, <8, (7, 9, 4)>, and <9, (4, 8, 7)>.
