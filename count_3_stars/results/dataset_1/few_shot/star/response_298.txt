Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (4, 7) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 7
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Looking at the graph and the given information, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<2, (6, 7, 9)>
<7, (1, 2, 4)>
<7, (1, 2, 8)>
<7, (1, 4, 8)>
<7, (2, 4, 8)>
<7, (2, 4, 9)>
<7, (2, 8, 9)>
<9, (0, 2, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
