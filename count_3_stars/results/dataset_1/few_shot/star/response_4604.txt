Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 4, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. These will be the central nodes of the 3-stars. Then, we identify the three nodes that are connected to each central node, which will be the leaves of the 3-stars.

Here are the 3-stars identified in the graph:

<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<1, (0, 7, 9)>
<4, (5, 6, 8)>
<5, (1, 4, 7)>
<6, (0, 3, 7)>
<7, (0, 1, 9)>
<8, (1, 4, 9)>
<9, (1, 7, 8)>

Therefore, there are a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
