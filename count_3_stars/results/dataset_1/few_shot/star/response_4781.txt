Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. Then we can list the unique 3-stars that are formed by considering each of these nodes as the center. 

Based on the given information, the nodes connected to exactly three other nodes are: 
- Node 1 (connected to nodes 2, 5, 6)
- Node 5 (connected to nodes 1, 3, 8)
- Node 7 (connected to nodes 3, 9)

Now, we will list the unique 3-stars formed:
<1, (2, 5, 6)>
<5, (1, 3, 8)>
<7, (3, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
