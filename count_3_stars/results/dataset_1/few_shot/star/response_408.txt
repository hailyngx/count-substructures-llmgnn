Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 7

Response:
To find all the 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the nodes that have exactly 3 neighbors. These nodes will represent the center nodes of the 3-stars. Let's list them:

1. Node 2 is a center node with 3 neighbors: (2, 7, 4) - <2, (7, 4, 1)>
2. Node 3 is a center node with 3 neighbors: (3, 5, 9) - <3, (5, 9, 7)>
3. Node 4 is a center node with 3 neighbors: (4, 1, 7) - <4, (1, 7, 5)>
4. Node 5 is a center node with 3 neighbors: (5, 1, 3) - <5, (1, 3, 7)>
5. Node 6 is not a center node.
6. Node 7 is a center node with 3 neighbors: (7, 0, 2) - <7 , (0, 2, 4)>
7. Node 8 is not a center node.
8. Node 9 is not a center node.

Therefore, we have identified a total of [5] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
