Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 4

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all sets of nodes where one node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a 3-star structure.

Let's list the 3-stars present in the graph:
<1, (2, 4, 7)>
<4, (1, 3, 6)>
<4, (8, 5, 9)>

Count of 3-stars: [3]
