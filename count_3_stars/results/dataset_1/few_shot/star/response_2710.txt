Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 8

Response:
Let's find the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

First, let's identify the 3-star configurations in the graph:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 7, and 9. This forms a 3-star with node 1 as the center and nodes 3, 7, 9 as the leaves. <1, (3, 7, 9)>
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 6. This forms a 3-star with node 2 as the center and nodes 3, 4, 6 as the leaves. <2, (3, 4, 6)>
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 4. This forms a 3-star with node 3 as the center and nodes 1, 2, 4 as the leaves. <3, (1, 2, 4)>
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 5. This forms a 3-star with node 4 as the center and nodes 2, 3, 5 as the leaves. <4, (2, 3, 5)>
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 7, and 9. This forms a 3-star with node 8 as the center and nodes 0, 7, 9 as the leaves. <8, (0, 7, 9)>

Now, count the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph: [5].
