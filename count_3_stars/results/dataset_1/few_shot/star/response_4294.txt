Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 4

Response:
Given graph has the following 3-stars:
<0, (1, 7, 8)>
<3, (0, 4, 7)>
<4, (0, 2, 9)>
<7, (0, 1, 3)>
[]
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the graph.
