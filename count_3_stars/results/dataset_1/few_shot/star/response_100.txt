Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern. 

Looking at the graph, we can see the following 3-stars:
<0, (1, 4, 7)>
<0, (1, 4, 8)>
<0, (1, 4, 9)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<2, (3, 4, 6)>
<2, (4, 6, 9)>
<3, (1, 2, 4)>
<5, (6, 7, 0)>
<6, (2, 5, 9)>
<8, (0, 1, 9)>

So, there are a total of [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
