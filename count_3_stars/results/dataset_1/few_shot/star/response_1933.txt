Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 5) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, 6, 7, and node 8

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph: 

<0, (8, 9)>
<5, (2, 3, 7)>
<5, (7, 8, 9)>
<9, (4, 6, 7)>
