Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 6

Response:
Let's find all the 3-stars in this graph:

1. Node 0 forms 1 3-star: <0, (1, 5, 7)>
2. Node 1 forms 1 3-star: <1, (0, 3, 7)>
3. Node 3 forms 4 3-stars: <3, (1, 4, 5)>, <3, (1, 5, 6)>, <3, (1, 5, 8)>, <3, (5, 4, 6)>
4. Node 5 forms 2 3-stars: <5, (0, 3, 4)>, <5, (0, 3, 6)>
5. Node 6 forms 1 3-star: <6, (3, 8, 9)>
6. Node 7 forms 1 3-star: <7, (0, 1, 8)>
7. Node 8 forms 2 3-stars: <8, (2, 3, 4)>, <8, (2, 3, 6)>
8. Node 9 forms 1 3-star: <9, (3, 6, 0)>

[Total number of 3-stars: 12]
