Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 8

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (1, 3, 4)>
2. <1, (0, 3, 5)>
3. <4, (0, 6, 9)>
4. <8, (1, 9, -)>

There are a total of [4] unique 3-stars in the graph.
