Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, representing a 3-star.

From the adjacency list and the given edges, we can see that there are three 3-stars in the provided graph.  

Calculations: 
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 6 forming the 3-star <0, (1, 5, 6)>
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 8 forming the 3-star <1, (0, 3, 8)>
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 3 forming the 3-star <8, (1, 2, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].

Here are the unique 3-stars: 
<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<1, (0, 3, 8)>
<8, (1, 2, 3)>
