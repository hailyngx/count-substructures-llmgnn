Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 2

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's go step-by-step to identify the 3-stars:

1. Identify potential central nodes:
    - Nodes 0, 2, 6, and 9 have degree 3 (connected to exactly 3 other nodes), so they can potentially serve as central nodes.

2. For each potential central node, check its neighbors and see if 3-star configurations exist:
    - For node 0: (0, 7, 9), so <0, (7, 9)> is a 3-star.
    - For node 2: (2, 4, 7) and (2, 7, 9), so <2, (4, 7)> and <2, (7, 9)> are 3-stars.
    - For node 6: (6, 1, 7) and (6, 7, 8), so <6, (1, 7)> and <6, (7, 8)> are 3-stars.
    - For node 9: (9, 0, 2), so <9, (0, 2)> is a 3-star.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (7, 9)>, 
<2, (4, 7)>, 
<2, (7, 9)>, 
<6, (1, 7)>, 
<6, (7, 8)>, 
<9, (0, 2)>.

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
