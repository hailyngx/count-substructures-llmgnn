Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 7
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Here are the steps to find and count the 3-stars:

1. Identify candidate nodes that have exactly three neighbors:
   - Nodes 0, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9 have exactly three neighbors.

2. For each candidate node, check if the neighbors form a 3-star pattern:
   - Node 0: (0, 2, 4, 7) is a 3-star.
   - Node 4: (4, 0, 5, 9) is a 3-star.
   - Node 5: (5, 2, 4, 7) is a 3-star.
   - Node 7: (7, 0, 5, 9) is a 3-star.
   - Node 9: (9, 4, 6, 7) is not a 3-star as it has four neighbors.

3. Count the total number of 3-stars in the graph: [2]

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 4, 7)>
<4, (0, 5, 9)> 

So, the final answer is [2].
