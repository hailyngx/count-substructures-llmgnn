Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 8

Response:
The center node of a 3-star graph is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

The possible 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<5, (0, 1, 6)>
<8, (1, 5, 9)>

There are 4 unique 3-stars in total. Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
