Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 8

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 
Based on the definition, a 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

From the adjacency list, we can list down all the 3-stars present in the graph:
<0, (2, 3, 5)>
<0, (2, 5, 6)>
<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<2, (0, 5, 6)>
<5, (0, 2, 3)>
<6, (0, 2, 4)>

Count of 3-stars in the graph: [6]
