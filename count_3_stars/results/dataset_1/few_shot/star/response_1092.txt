Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's determine the 3-stars:

1. Node 0 connects to nodes 1, 4, and 5: <0, (1, 4, 5)>
2. Node 1 connects to nodes 0, 4, and 5: <1, (0, 4, 5)>
3. Node 2 does not form a 3-star.
4. Node 3 does not form a 3-star.
5. Node 4 connects to nodes 0, 1, and 6: <4, (0, 1, 6)>
6. Node 5 does not form a 3-star.
7. Node 6 does not form a 3-star.
8. Node 7 does not form a 3-star.
9. Node 8 does not form a 3-star.
10. Node 9 does not form a 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2]. The unique 3-stars found are <0, (1, 4, 5)> and <4, (0, 1, 6)>.
