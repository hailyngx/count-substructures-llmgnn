Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 1) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first identify the central nodes that have exactly three neighbors. Then, we check if each of these central nodes forms a 3-star structure with its three neighbors.

The central nodes in this graph are nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 6. Nodes 0, 1, and 2 meet the criteria of having exactly three neighbors.

Now, let's identify the 3-stars centered at these central nodes:
- Central node 0: 
    - <0, (3, 6, 9)>
- Central node 1: 
    - <1, (3, 4, 5)>
- Central node 2:
    - None

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
