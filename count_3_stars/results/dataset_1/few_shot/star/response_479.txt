Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 3

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step by step:

1. Node 0:
   - <0, (1, 4, 8)>

2. Node 1:
   - <1, (0, 2, 8)>

3. Node 3:
   - No 3-star as it is connected to only two nodes.

4. Node 4:
   - <4, (0, 3, 6)>

5. Node 5:
   - <5, (2, 3, 6)>
   - <5, (3, 5, 7)>
   - <5, (7, 8, 5)>

6. Node 6:
   - No 3-star as it is connected to only two nodes.

7. Node 7:
   - No 3-star as it is connected to only two nodes.

8. Node 8:
   - <8, (0, 1, 5)>

In total, we have found 7 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
