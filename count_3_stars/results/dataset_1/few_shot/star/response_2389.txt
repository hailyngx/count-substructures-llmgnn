Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 8: <0, (3, 8)>
2. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 5: <1, (2, 5)>
3. Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 4: <2, (1, 4)>
4. Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 8: <2, (4, 8)>
5. Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 8: <3, (0, 8)>
6. Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 6: <5, (1, 6)>
7. Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 9: <5, (6, 9)>
8. Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 7: <6, (5, 7)>
9. Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 3: <8, (0, 3)>
10. Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 4: <8, (2, 4)>

Therefore, there are a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
