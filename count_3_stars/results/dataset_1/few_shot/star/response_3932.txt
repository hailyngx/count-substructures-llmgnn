Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can iterate through each node and check if it forms a 3-star. A 3-star can be identified by a central node connected to exactly 3 other nodes. Let's go through all the nodes:

For Node 0:
- Node 0 is connected to 5, 6, 7, and 8, forming a 3-star <0, (5, 6, 7)>.

For Node 2:
- Node 2 is connected to 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7, forming two 3-stars <2, (3, 4, 5)> and <2, (4, 6, 7)>.

For Node 4:
- Node 4 is connected to 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7, forming four 3-stars <4, (0, 2, 3)>, <4, (2, 5, 6)>, <4, (2, 6, 7)>, and <4, (3, 5, 7)>.

For Node 5:
- Node 5 is connected to 0, 2, 4, and 9, forming a 3-star <5, (0, 2, 4)>.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: [7]
