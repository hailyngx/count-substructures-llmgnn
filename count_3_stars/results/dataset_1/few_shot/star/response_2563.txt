Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern with that node as the center.

Analyzing the given graph:

- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 4. This forms a 3-star with Node 5 as the center.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 5, and 8. This forms a 3-star with Node 3 as the center.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 4. This forms a 3-star with Node 6 as the center.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].

Unique 3-stars:
<5, (2, 3, 4)>
<3, (0, 5, 8)>
<6, (0, 1, 4)>
