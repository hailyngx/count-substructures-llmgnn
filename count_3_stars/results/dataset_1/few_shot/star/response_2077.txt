Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

By examining the adjacency list, we find the following 3-stars:
<0, (3, 4, 8)>
<2, (3, 4, 8)>
<4, (0, 2, 6)>
<8, (0, 2, 5)>
<9, (4, 5, 0)>

Hence, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
