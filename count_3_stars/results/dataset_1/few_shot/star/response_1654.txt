Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify which nodes can act as the center of a 3-star. Since a 3-star has a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we look for nodes with degree 3.

In this graph, nodes 1, 3, 5, 7, and 8 have a degree of 3, making them potential centers for 3-stars. Let's analyze each of these potential centers:

1. Node 1: <1, (4, 6, 8)> 
2. Node 3: <3, (5, 8, 0)> 
3. Node 5: <5, (3, 4, 7)> 
4. Node 7: <7, (5, 9, 0)> 
5. Node 8: <8, (1, 3, 9)> 

Counting the unique 3-stars identified above, we find a total of [5].
