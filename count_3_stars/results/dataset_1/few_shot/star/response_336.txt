Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern.

In this case, we can see that the following 3-star patterns exist:

<1, (2, 4, 9)>
<2, (0, 1, 5)>
<3, (7, 9, 6)>
<4, (1, 8, -)>
<5, (2, 9, -)>
<6, (0, 7, 9)>

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
