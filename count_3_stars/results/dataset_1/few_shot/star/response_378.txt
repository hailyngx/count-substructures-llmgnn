Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we first need to identify the 3-stars. In a 3-star, the center node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Here are the unique 3-stars in the given graph:
<0, (1, 6, 9)>
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<1, (2, 6, 8)>
<1, (6, 7, 8)>
<2, (1, 3, 5)>
<4, (8, 9, -)>
<6, (0, 1, 7)>
<8, (1, 2, 4)>
<9, (0, 4, 6)>

Count of 3-stars: [9]
