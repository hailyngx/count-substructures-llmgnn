Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a 3-star pattern. 

Looking at the adjacency list for each node, we can identify the following unique 3-stars:

[<1, (2, 3, 5)>, <1, (2, 5, 7)>, <1, (2, 5, 9)>, <1, (3, 1, 7)>, <1, (3, 1, 8)>, <1, (5, 1, 9)>,
<4, (0, 6, 7)>, <4, (6, 9, 7)>, <6, (4, 9, 7)>, <7, (4, 1, 7)>, <7, (1, 4, 7)>, <9, (2, 5, 6)>]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
