Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 6

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph:

- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 7, and 8. (<0, (1, 7, 8)>)

- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 3, and 6. (<1, (0, 3, 6)>)

- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 5, and 8. (<2, (4, 5, 8)>)

- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 5, and 7. (<6, (1, 5, 7)>)

- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 8, and 9. (<6, (1, 8, 9)>)

There are a total of [4] 3-star graphs in the given graph.
