Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

By examining the adjacency list provided, we can identify the following 3-stars: 
<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<1, (2, 8, -)>
<2, (0, 1, 5)>
<3, (0, 7, 9)>
<4, (0, 5, 9)>
<5, (2, 4, 6)>
<6, (2, 5, 7)>
<7, (3, 6, -)>
<8, (1, -, -)>
<9, (3, 4, -)>

Counting the unique 3-stars:
