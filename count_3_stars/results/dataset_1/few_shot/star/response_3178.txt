Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 7

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

Unique 3-star configurations: 
<0, (5, 8, 1)>
<3, (5, 6, 8)>
<3, (5, 8, 9)>
<3, (6, 5, 9)>
