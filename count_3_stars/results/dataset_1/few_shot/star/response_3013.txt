Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a star pattern. 

Based on the given adjacency list, we find the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<0, (3, 5, 9)>
<1, (0, 3, 8)>
<2, (0, 9, 8)>
<3, (0, 1, 6)>
<3, (0, 1, 7)>
<3, (1, 7, 8)>
<9, (0, 2, 4)>
<9, (2, 4, 6)>
<9, (4, 6, 8)>

Counting all the unique 3-stars above, we find a total of [10] 3-stars in the graph.
