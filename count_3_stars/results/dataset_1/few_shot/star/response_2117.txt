Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the 3-stars by finding all instances where a node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes. 

The 3-stars in the given graph are:
<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<3, (0, 4, 6)>
<4, (0, 2, 5)>
<7, (1, 3, 5)>
<8, (1, 4, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
