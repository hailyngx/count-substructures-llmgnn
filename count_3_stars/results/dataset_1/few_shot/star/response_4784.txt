Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's find the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 5, and 6.
2. Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 7, and 8.
3. Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 5, and 7.

Therefore, there are a total of [3] 3-stars in the given graph.

<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<0, (3, 7, 8)>
<3, (0, 5, 7)>
