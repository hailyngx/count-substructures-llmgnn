Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 2

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes in a star-like pattern.

In this graph, let's find all 3-stars:
1. From the adjacency list, we can see that nodes 0, 4, 6 do not have enough connections to form a 3-star.
2. For the remaining nodes:
    - Node 1 is part of a 3-star <1, (2, 4, 5)>.
    - Node 2 is part of two 3-stars: <2, (3, 1, 9)> and <2, (4, 5, 7)>.
    - Node 3 is part of a 3-star <3, (2, 5, 8)>.
    - Node 5 is part of a 3-star <5, (1, 2, 3)>.
    - Node 7 is part of a 3-star <7, (0, 2, 0)>.
    - Node 8 is part of a 3-star <8, (3, 6, 3)>.
    - Node 9 is part of a 3-star <9, (1, 2, 1)>.

Therefore, there are a total of 6 3-stars in the given graph.

Final answer: [6]

Unique 3-stars:
<1, (2, 4, 5)>
<2, (3, 1, 9)>
<2, (4, 5, 7)>
<3, (2, 5, 8)>
<5, (1, 2, 3)>
<7, (0, 2, 0)>
<8, (3, 6, 3)>
<9, (1, 2, 1)>
