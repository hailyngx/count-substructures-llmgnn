Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, and node 7

Response:
The 3-star structures in the given graph are:
<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<1, (0, 7, 9)>
<2, (3, 4, 9)>
<5, (0, 6, 7)>
<6, (0, 5, 8)>
<7, (1, 5, 9)>
<9, (1, 2, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
