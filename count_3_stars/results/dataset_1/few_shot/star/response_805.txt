Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, 6, and node 8

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are:
<1, (3, 7, 9)>
<1, (7, 4, 9)>
<4, (0, 5, 7)>
<7, (1, 5, 6)>
<9, (1, 5, 8)>

Count of 3-stars: [5]
