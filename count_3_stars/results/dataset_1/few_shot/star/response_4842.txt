Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars present. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify them step by step:

1. Identify all nodes connected to exactly three other nodes:
   - Node 1, Node 6, and Node 5 are connected to exactly three other nodes.

2. For each of these nodes, identify the unique 3-stars they are a part of:
   - For Node 1: <1, (5, 6, 9)>
   - For Node 6: <6, (1, 3, 7)>
   - For Node 5: <5, (1, 2, 6)> and <5, (6, 7, 9)>

We have identified all the unique 3-stars in the graph. Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars found.
