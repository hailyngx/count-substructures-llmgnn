Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 4, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star configuration.

Looking at the adjacency list for each node:

- Node 2 is connected to nodes 4 and 6, forming a 3-star <2, (4, 6)>.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 7, forming a 3-star <4, (2, 5, 7)>.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 4, 7, and 8, forming a 3-star <5, (4, 7, 8)>.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 4, 7, and 8, forming a 3-star <6, (4, 7, 8)>.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 9, forming a 3-star <8, (5, 6, 9)>.

There are a total of 5 unique 3-stars in this graph, which are listed above. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
