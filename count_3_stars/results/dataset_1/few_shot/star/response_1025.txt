Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes (forming a 3-star pattern).

Looking at the adjacency list, we can identify the nodes with edges to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 3, 6, and 9.

Let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph.

Total number of 3-stars = 3
[3]

Unique 3-stars:
<2, (1, 4, 9)>
<3, (5, 6, 8)>
<8, (3, 6, 9)>
