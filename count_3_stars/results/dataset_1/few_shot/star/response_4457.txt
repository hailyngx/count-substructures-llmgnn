Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 6

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are: 
<3, (4, 6, 9)>
<4, (3, 6, 8)>
<6, (2, 3, 5)>
<8, (4, 6, 7)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4].
