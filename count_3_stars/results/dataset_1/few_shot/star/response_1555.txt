Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star pattern (a central node connected to exactly three leaves). Let's go step-by-step:

The graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. Here's the adjacency list for each node for reference:

Node 0: 4
Node 1: 2, 5, 6, 7
Node 2: 1, 8
Node 3: 4, 7, 9
Node 4: 0, 3, 6
Node 5: 1, 6
Node 6: 1, 4, 5, 8, 9
Node 7: 1, 3
Node 8: 2, 6
Node 9: 3, 6

Now, let's identify the 3-star patterns (central node connected to exactly three leaves):

<1, (2, 5, 6)>
<1, (2, 6, 8)>
<1, (5, 6, 7)>
<3, (4, 7, 9)>
<6, (1, 4, 5)>
<6, (1, 5, 8)>
<6, (4, 5, 9)>
<6, (8, 9, 1)>
<7, (1, 3, 9)>
<8, (2, 6, 9)>

There are a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
