Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, and node 6

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each possible 3-star configuration.

Starting with Node 0:
- (0, 1, 5) forms a 3-star with Node 0 as the center and nodes 1, 5 as leaves.
- (0, 3, 9) forms a 3-star with Node 0 as the center and nodes 3, 9 as leaves.

Continuing with Node 1:
- (1, 0, 5) forms a 3-star with Node 1 as the center and nodes 0, 5 as leaves.
- (1, 5, 9) forms a 3-star with Node 1 as the center and nodes 5, 9 as leaves.

At this point, we have covered all possible 3-stars in the given graph. Counting the unique 3-stars, we have:
<[0, (1, 5)], [0, (3, 9)], [1, (0, 5)], [1, (5, 9)]> 

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
