Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 8
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 3

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0: <0, (2, 4, 5)>
- Node 1: <1, (4, 5, 7)>
- Node 2: <2, (0, 3, 8)>
- Node 3: <3, (2, 7, 9)>
- Node 5: <5, (0, 1, 8)>

There are 5 unique 3-stars in the graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
