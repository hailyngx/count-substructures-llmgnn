Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
The steps to count the number of 3-stars in the given graph are as follows:

Step 1: Identify the nodes with exactly 3 neighbors, as these nodes can be central nodes of 3-stars. In this case, nodes 0, 1, 4, and 6 have exactly 3 neighbors.

Step 2: For each of these candidate central nodes, check if they are indeed the center of a 3-star. To form a 3-star, the center node must be connected to exactly 3 other nodes.

Step 3: List all unique 3-stars found.

Let's go ahead and follow these steps to find the unique 3-stars:
