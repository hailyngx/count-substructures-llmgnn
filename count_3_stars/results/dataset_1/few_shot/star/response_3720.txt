Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the adjacency list provided, we can see that the nodes 1, 2, and 5 each have 3 connections, making them potential centers for 3-stars. Let's identify and count the unique 3-stars:

1. <1, (2, 8, 9)>
2. <2, (1, 4, 5)>
3. <5, (1, 2, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
