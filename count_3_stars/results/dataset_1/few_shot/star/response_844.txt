Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 7, and node 8

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
1. Node 0 has 3-stars: <0, (1, 8, 9)>
2. Node 1 has 1 3-star: <1, (0, 2, 8)>
3. Node 2 has 1 3-star: <2, (1, 8, 9)>
4. Node 3 has no 3-stars.
5. Node 4 has no 3-stars.
6. Node 5 has no 3-stars.
7. Node 6 has no 3-stars.
8. Node 7 has no 3-stars.
9. Node 8 has 1 3-star: <8, (0, 1, 9)>
10. Node 9 has no 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].  
The 3-stars are <0, (1, 8, 9)>, <1, (0, 2, 8)>, and <8, (0, 1, 9)>.
