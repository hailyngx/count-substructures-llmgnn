Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars and list them, let's first identify the 3-star configurations in this graph. 
- A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found in this graph:

<3, (1, 4, 7)>
<8, (1, 2, 5)>
<8, (1, 2, 6)>
<8, (1, 5, 9)>
<8, (1, 6, 9)>
<8, (2, 5, 9)>
<8, (2, 6, 9)>
<8, (5, 6, 9)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we get:
[8]
