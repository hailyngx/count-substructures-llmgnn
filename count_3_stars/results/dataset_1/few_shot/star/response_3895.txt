Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern.

Based on the given adjacency list, we can determine the following 3-stars:

<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<0, (2, 4, 7)>
<0, (2, 6, 9)>
<0, (4, 7, 9)>
<2, (0, 4, 6)>
<2, (0, 4, 7)>
<2, (4, 6, 9)>
<4, (0, 2, 7)>
<4, (0, 7, 9)>
<4, (2, 6, 7)>
<4, (2, 7, 9)>
<4, (6, 7, 9)>
<6, (0, 2, 9)>
<7, (0, 4, 9)>
<7, (2, 4, 9)>
<7, (4, 6, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [16] and the unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<0, (2, 4, 7)>
<0, (2, 6, 9)>
<0, (4, 7, 9)>
<2, (0, 4, 6)>
<2, (0, 4, 7)>
<2, (4, 6, 9)>
<4, (0, 2, 7)>
<4, (0, 7, 9)>
<4, (2, 6, 7)>
<4, (2, 7, 9)>
<4, (6, 7, 9)>
<6, (0, 2, 9)>
<7, (0, 4, 9)>
<7, (2, 4, 9)>
<7, (4, 6, 9)>
