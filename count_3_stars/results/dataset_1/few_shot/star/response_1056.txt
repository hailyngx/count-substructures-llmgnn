Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 8

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to locate all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges, forming a 3-star pattern. Let's identify them step by step:

1. Node 2: (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 8) <2, (3, 4, 8)>
2. Node 3: (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 7) <3, (2, 4, 7)>
3. Node 4: (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3) <4, (0, 2, 3)>
4. Node 8: (8, 1), (8, 2), (8, 4) <8, (1, 2, 4)>
5. Node 9: (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3) <9, (1, 2, 3)>

Count of 3-stars: [5]
Unique 3-stars: <2, (3, 4, 8)>, <3, (2, 4, 7)>, <4, (0, 2, 3)>, <8, (1, 2, 4)>, <9, (1, 2, 3)>
