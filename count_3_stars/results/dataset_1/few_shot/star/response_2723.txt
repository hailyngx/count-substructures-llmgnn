Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 6
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 6

Response:
The center nodes with exactly 3 leaves are: 0, 1, 4, 6, and 9. Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<0, (4, 6, 9)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<1, (0, 4, 6)>
<4, (0, 1, 3)>
<4, (0, 3, 6)>
<4, (0, 5, 8)>
<4, (1, 3, 6)>
<6, (0, 4, 1)>
<6, (0, 4, 3)>
<6, (0, 5, 7)>
<6, (0, 9, 1)>
<6, (0, 9, 4)>
<6, (1, 4, 3)>
<6, (4, 5, 8)>
<6, (4, 7, 0)>
<6, (4, 7, 8)>
<9, (0, 4, 6)>
