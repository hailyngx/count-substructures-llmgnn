Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the 3-stars present. Recall that a 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through the adjacency list of each node and count the number of 3-stars.

We have the following 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<0, (2, 3, 5)>
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<0, (2, 5, 6)>
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<1, (4, 7, 8)>
<1, (7, 8, 9)>
<2, (0, 7, 5)>
<3, (0, 5, 4)>
<3, (0, 6, 8)>
<4, (0, 5, 8)>
<5, (0, 4, 8)>
<5, (0, 7, 8)>
<7, (1, 5, 2)>
<8, (1, 6, 3)>

Counting all the unique 3-stars listed above, we find a total of [16] 3-stars in the given graph. 
So, the final answer is [16].
