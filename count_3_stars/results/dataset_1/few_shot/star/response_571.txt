Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 3

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern.

Looking at the given graph description, we observe the following 3-star patterns:
<0, (4, 5, X)>
<2, (6, 7, X)>
<2, (6, 9, X)>
<2, (7, 9, X)>
<5, (0, 1, X)>
<6, (2, 7, X)>
<6, (2, 8, X)>
<6, (7, 8, X)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].  
[<0, (4, 5, X)>, <2, (6, 7, X)>, <2, (6, 9, X)>, <2, (7, 9, X)>, <5, (0, 1, X)>, <6, (2, 7, X)>, <6, (2, 8, X)>, <6, (7, 8, X)>]
