Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's find these 3-stars step by step:

Step 1: Identify the central nodes:
- Node 8 is a central node as it is connected to nodes 2, 3, 6, 7.

Step 2: For each central node, identify the sets of three nodes it is connected to:
- For Node 8, the sets are: (2, 3, 6), (2, 3, 7), (2, 6, 7), and (3, 6, 7).

Step 3: Count the unique 3-stars:
- <8, (2, 3, 6)>
- <8, (2, 3, 7)>
- <8, (2, 6, 7)>
- <8, (3, 6, 7)>

Final answer: [4]
