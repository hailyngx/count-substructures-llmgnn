Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 1

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Based on the definition of a 3-star, we can see that only nodes 1, 2, 3, and 8 meet this criteria.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<1, (2, 6, 7)>
<1, (2, 7, 8)>
<1, (6, 7, 8)>
<2, (1, 3, 8)>
<2, (1, 8, 3)>
<3, (2, 4, 7)>
<3, (2, 7, 8)>
<3, (4, 5, 7)>
<3, (4, 7, 8)>
<8, (1, 2, 3)>
<8, (1, 3, 2)>
