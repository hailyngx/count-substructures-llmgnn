Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. We will list the unique 3-stars found in the graph.

Let's start by identifying the 3-stars: 
1. Node 0: (7, 9)
2. Node 5: (1, 2, 4), (1, 4, 5), (2, 4, 5), (4, 5, 7), (4, 5, 8)
3. Node 7: (0, 2, 5), (2, 5, 7), (5, 7, 8), (6, 7, 8)
4. Node 8: (5, 6, 7), (5, 7, 8), (5, 8, 9), (6, 7, 8)


Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [13].
The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (7, 9)>
<5, (1, 2, 4)>
<5, (1, 4, 5)>
<5, (2, 4, 5)>
<5, (4, 5, 7)>
<5, (4, 5, 8)>
<7, (0, 2, 5)>
<7, (2, 5, 7)>
<7, (5, 7, 8)>
<7, (6, 7, 8)>
<8, (5, 6, 7)>
<8, (5, 7, 8)>
<8, (5, 8, 9)>
