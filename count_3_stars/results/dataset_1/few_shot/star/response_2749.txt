Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 4

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 5, and 8. (<0, (4, 5, 8)>)
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 7, and 9. (<1, (3, 7, 9)>)
- Node 4 forms four 3-stars:
  - with nodes 0, 2, and 5. (<4, (0, 2, 5)>)
  - with nodes 0, 6, and 7. (<4, (0, 6, 7)>)
  - with nodes 0, 9, and 5. (<4, (0, 9, 5)>)
  - with nodes 1, 2, and 6. (<4, (1, 2, 6)>)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
