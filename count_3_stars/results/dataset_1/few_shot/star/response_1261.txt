Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 6, 7, and node 8

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

1. For each node in the graph, check if it forms a 3-star:
    - Node 0 does not form a 3-star.
    - Node 1 does not form a 3-star.
    - Node 2 does not form a 3-star.
    - **Node 3 forms a 3-star** with leaves 1, 4, and 7. <3, (1, 4, 7)>
    - Node 4 does not form a 3-star.
    - Node 5 does not form a 3-star.
    - Node 6 does not form a 3-star.
    - **Node 7 forms a 3-star** with leaves 3, 4, and 9. <7, (3, 4, 9)>
    - Node 8 does not form a 3-star.
    - Node 9 does not form a 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is **2**.
