Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges, forming a 3-star structure. 

Based on the provided adjacency list and the definition of a 3-star graph, we can identify the following unique 3-stars:
<0, (2, 5, 6)>
<2, (0, 4, 7)>
<4, (2, 5, 9)>
<5, (0, 4, 7)>
<7, (2, 3, 5)>
<8, (6, 7, --)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
