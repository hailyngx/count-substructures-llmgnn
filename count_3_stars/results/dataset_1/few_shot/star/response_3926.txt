Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for each node that has exactly 3 edges originating from it. These nodes can form the center of a 3-star graph. We will then identify the neighbors of these nodes and check if they form a 3-star pattern around the central node.

Looking at the graph, we identify the following central nodes:

1. Node 2: Connected to nodes 0, 1, 5
2. Node 3: Connected to nodes 4, 5, 8
3. Node 6: Connected to nodes 2, 7, 8
4. Node 7: Connected to nodes 2, 4, 6
5. Node 8: Connected to nodes 1, 3, 6

For each of these central nodes, we check if the neighbors form a 3-star pattern. 

Calculations:

For Node 2:
- <2, (0, 1, 5)> [1 unique 3-star]

For Node 3:
- <3, (4, 5, 8)> [1 unique 3-star]

For Node 6:
- <6, (2, 7, 8)> [1 unique 3-star]

For Node 7:
- <7, (2, 4, 6)> [1 unique 3-star]

For Node 8:
- No 3-star can be formed.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
