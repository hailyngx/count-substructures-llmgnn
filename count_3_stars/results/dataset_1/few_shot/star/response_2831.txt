Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 8

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes that have exactly three neighbors:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 3, 7, 9
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 3, 4, 5
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 0, 2, 4
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 2, 8, 9
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 1, 3, 8

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars by looking at each potential central node. Here are the 3-stars in the graph:

<Node 0, (3, 7, 9)>
<Node 2, (3, 4, 5)>
<Node 3, (0, 2, 4)>
<Node 5, (2, 8, 9)>
<Node 6, (1, 3, 8)>

Counting these unique 3-stars gives us a total of [5].
