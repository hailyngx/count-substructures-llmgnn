Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 4, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 6, 7, and node 8

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star-like pattern.

Let's go through each node and its connections:

- Node 0 is a center of a 3-star: <0, (2, 4, 8)>
- Node 1 doesn't form a 3-star.
- Node 2 doesn't form a 3-star. 
- Node 3 doesn't form a 3-star. 
- Node 4 is a center of a 3-star: <4, (0, 5, 6)>
- Node 5 doesn't form a 3-star.
- Node 6 is a center of one 3-star: <6, (2, 4, 7)>
- Node 7 doesn't form a 3-star.
- Node 8 doesn't form a 3-star.
- Node 9 doesn't form a 3-star.

Thus, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2]. 
The two unique 3-stars are <0, (2, 4, 8)> and <4, (0, 5, 6)>.
