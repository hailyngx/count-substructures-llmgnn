Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 8

Response:
Let's first identify the 3-stars in the graph. Recall that a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

From the given adjacency list and edge list, we can identify the following 3-stars:
1. <0, (2, 3, 5)>
2. <1, (3, 4, 5)>
3. <3, (0, 1, 2)>
4. <3, (0, 1, 9)>
5. <4, (1, 6, 9)>
6. <5, (0, 1, 6)>
7. <6, (0, 4, 5)>
8. <9, (3, 4, 8)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
