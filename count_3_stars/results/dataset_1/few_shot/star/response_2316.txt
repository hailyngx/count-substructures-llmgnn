Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star-like pattern.

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 0: <0, (5, 6)>
2. Node 2: <2, (4, 7, 8)>
3. Node 3: <3, (7, 8)>
4. Node 4: <4, (2, 8)>
5. Node 5: <5, (0, 1, 9)>

Hence, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5]. 
The unique 3-stars found are <0, (5, 6)>, <2, (4, 7, 8)>, <3, (7, 8)>, <4, (2, 8)>, and <5, (0, 1, 9)>.
