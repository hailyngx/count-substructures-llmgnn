Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible instances where a node has exactly three edges connecting it to other nodes.

After examining the graph and adjacency list, we find that the central node in a 3-star must have degree 3. In other words, the central node must be connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list the 3-stars present in the graph:
<0, (2, 9, 1)>
<1, (8, 9, 0)>
<2, (0, 5, 9)>
<5, (2, 3, 7)>
<9, (0, 1, 8)>
