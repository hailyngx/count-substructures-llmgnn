Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes (forming a 3-star pattern).

Based on the adjacency list provided, the 3-stars in the graph are as follows:

<0, (2, 5, 9)>
<2, (0, 5, 6)>
<5, (0, 2, 9)>
<6, (1, 2, 8)>
<8, (1, 6, 9)>
<9, (0, 5, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
