Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star-like configuration.

Looking at the adjacency list for each node, we can see the following 3-stars in the graph:

<1, (0, 5, 6)>
<1, (5, 6, 7)>
<1, (6, 7, 9)>
<3, (2, 6, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
