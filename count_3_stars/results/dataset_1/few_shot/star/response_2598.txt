Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, and node 7

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph:
<0, (4, 6, 7)>
<1, (2, 3, 4)>
<3, (1, 4, 6)>
<4, (0, 3, 5)>
<5, (4, 7, 9)>
<6, (0, 3, 8)>
<7, (0, 5, 9)>
<8, (4, 6, 7)>
<9, (4, 5, 6)>

So, the total number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [9].
