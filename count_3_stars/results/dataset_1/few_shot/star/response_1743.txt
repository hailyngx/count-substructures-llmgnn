Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars present. 

Looking at the adjacency list provided, we can find the following 3-stars:
<0, (3, 4, 9)>
<1, (5, 8, 9)>
<2, (5, 6, 0)>
<3, (0, 4, 5)>
<4, (0, 3, 9)>
<5, (1, 2, 8)>
<9, (1, 3, 4)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
