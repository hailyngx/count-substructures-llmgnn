Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the 3-stars. 

Here are the 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (1, 2, 9)>
<1, (0, 2, 5)>
<2, (0, 1, 5)>
<3, (5, 6, 9)>
<6, (2, 3, 9)>

Count of 3-stars: [5]
