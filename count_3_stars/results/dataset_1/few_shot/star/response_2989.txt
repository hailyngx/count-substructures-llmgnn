Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 7

Response:
The central nodes in a 3-star graph must have exactly 3 edges connected to them. Looking at the given graph, we can see that nodes 3, 4, 7, and 8 are the only nodes that satisfy this condition. Let's analyze each and determine the 3-star configurations:

1. For node 3: (3, 0) (3, 4)
2. For node 4: (4, 3) (4, 8)
3. For node 7: (7, 6) (7, 9)
4. For node 8: (8, 4) (8, 5)

It seems there are 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<3, (0, 4)>
<4, (3, 8)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
