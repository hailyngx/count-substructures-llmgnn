Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 3

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for nodes that have exactly three neighbors and form a 3-star pattern around them. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we find that nodes 2, 5, and 6 do not have exactly three neighbors, so they cannot be the center of a 3-star.

The possible 3-stars in this graph can be formed around the following central nodes:
1. Node 0: (0, 3, 7)
2. Node 1: (1, 5, 7)
3. Node 3: (3, 0, 4), (3, 0, 6), (3, 0, 9), (3, 4, 6), (3, 4, 9), (3, 6, 9)
4. Node 4: (4, 3, 8)
5. Node 7: (7, 0, 1), (7, 0, 8)
6. Node 8: (8, 2, 4), (8, 2, 7)

Counting the unique 3-stars listed above, we find:
<0, (3, 7, 0)>, <3, (4, 6, 0)>, <3, (6, 9, 0)>, <7, (0, 1, 7)>, <8, (2, 7, 8)>
Therefore, there are a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
