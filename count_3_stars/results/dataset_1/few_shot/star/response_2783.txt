Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's calculate this step-by-step:

1. Look for nodes that have exactly three neighbors:
   - Node 1, Node 2, Node 3, Node 7, and Node 9 have three neighbors each.

2. Identify all the 3-stars:
   - For Node 1: (1, 2, 4, 7), (1, 2, 7, 9)
   - For Node 2: (2, 0, 1, 7)
   - For Node 3: (3, 2, 7, 9)
   - For Node 7: (7, 1, 2, 5)
   - For Node 9: (9, 1, 3, 5), (9, 1, 5, 6)

Listing unique 3-stars:
<1, (2, 4, 7)>
<1, (2, 7, 9)>
<2, (0, 1, 7)>
<3, (2, 7, 9)>
<7, (1, 2, 5)>
<9, (1, 3, 5)>
<9, (1, 5, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
