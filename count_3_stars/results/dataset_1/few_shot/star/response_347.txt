Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a 3-star.

From the adjacency list provided, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (3, 4, 6)>
<1, (6, 7, 9)>
<3, (0, 2, 4)>
<4, (0, 3, 6)>
<6, (0, 1, 4)>
<6, (1, 7, 9)>
<6, (4, 8, 0)>
<6, (5, 7, 9)>
<6, (7, 1, 9)>
<6, (8, 4, 0)>

Counting these unique 3-stars, we find a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
