Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a 3-star pattern. Let's identify all the 3-stars in the graph:

There are 4 unique 3-stars in this graph:
<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<1, (4, 5, 8)>
<3, (0, 2, 8)>
<6, (0, 4, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
