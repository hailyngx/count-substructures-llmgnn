Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges, forming a 3-star pattern.

In this graph, we can identify the following 3-stars:

<0, (3, 8), (3, 8)>  -> Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 8 forming a 3-star.
<1, (4, 5), (4, 5)>  -> Node 1 is connected to nodes 4, 5 forming a 3-star.
<2, (7, 9), (7, 9)>  -> Node 2 is connected to nodes 7, 9 forming a 3-star.
<5, (4, 1), (4, 1)>  -> Node 5 is connected to nodes 4, 1 forming a 3-star.
<9, (7, 2), (7, 2)>  -> Node 9 is connected to nodes 7, 2 forming a 3-star.

So, there are [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
