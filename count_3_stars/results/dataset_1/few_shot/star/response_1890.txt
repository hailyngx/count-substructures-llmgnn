Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's find the 3-stars:
1. Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes (4, 5, 6) <0, (4, 5, 6)>
2. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes (2, 5, 8) <1, (2, 5, 8)>
3. Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes (2, 5, 8) <3, (2, 5, 8)>
4. Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes (0, 1, 3) <5, (0, 1, 3)>
5. Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes (1, 3, 4) <8, (1, 3, 4)>
6. Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes (3, 5, 6) <9, (3, 5, 6)>

Count of 3-stars in the given graph: [5]
Therefore, the final answer is [5].
