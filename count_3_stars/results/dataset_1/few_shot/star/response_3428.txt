Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 8) (2, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 6

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the graph. Central nodes are those connected to exactly three other nodes. In this case, nodes 6 and 8 are the central nodes.

Next, let's check the neighbors of these central nodes to form 3-stars. 

For node 6:
- (6, 2, 8, 9)
- (6, 7, 8)
- (6, 8, 2)
- (6, 9, 6)

For node 8:
- (8, 1, 5)
- (8, 5, 7)
- (8, 6, 2)

Therefore, there are a total of [7] 3-stars in the given graph.
<6, (2, 8, 9)>
<6, (7, 8)>
<6, (2, 6, 8)>
<6, (6, 9, 6)>
<8, (1, 5, 8)>
<8, (5, 7, 8)>
<8, (2, 6, 8)>
