Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 3

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be calculated by considering each node as the center of a star and counting the number of 3-stars around it.

Number of 3-stars around each node:
- Node 0: (1, 2, 4), (1, 2, 6), (1, 2, 9), (1, 4, 6), (1, 4, 9), (1, 6, 9) (6 different 3-stars)
- Node 1: No 3-star
- Node 2: (0, 3, 4), (0, 3, 5), (0, 3, 6), (3, 4, 5), (3, 4, 6), (3, 5, 6) (6 different 3-stars)
- Node 3: No 3-star
- Node 4: (0, 2, 5), (0, 2, 8), (0, 5, 8), (2, 5, 8) (4 different 3-stars)
- Node 5: No 3-star
- Node 6: (0, 2, 3), (0, 2, 7), (0, 3, 7), (2, 3, 7) (4 different 3-stars)
- Node 7: No 3-star
- Node 8: (2, 4, 5), (2, 4, 6), (2, 4, 7), (4, 5, 6), (4, 5, 7), (5, 6, 7) (6 different 3-stars)
- Node 9: No 3-star

Total number of 3-stars in the graph: 16
