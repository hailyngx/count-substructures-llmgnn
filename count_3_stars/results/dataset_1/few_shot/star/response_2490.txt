Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can identify 3-stars by looking for nodes that are connected to exactly 3 other nodes. Let's go through the nodes one by one and determine if they are a part of any 3-stars:

1. Node 1: (2, 7, 8), (2, 7, 9), (2, 8, 9), (7, 8, 9) [4 unique 3-stars]
2. Node 2: (1, 7, 8), (1, 7, 9), (1, 8, 9), (7, 8, 9) [4 unique 3-stars]
3. Node 3: (2, 4, 6), (2, 6, 9), (4, 6, 9) [3 unique 3-stars]
4. Node 4: (3, 6, 8) [1 unique 3-star]
5. Node 5: Not connected to 3 other nodes, so no 3-stars.
6. Node 6: (3, 4, 9), (4, 6, 8), (6, 8, 9) [3 unique 3-stars]
7. Node 7: (1, 8, 9) [1 unique 3-star]
8. Node 8: (1, 4, 6), (1, 6, 9), (4, 6, 9) [3 unique 3-stars]
9. Node 9: (1, 7, 8), (1, 2, 3), (2, 3, 6), (3, 6, 8) [4 unique 3-stars]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [18]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: 
<1, (2, 7, 8)>
<2, (1, 7, 8)>
<3, (2, 4, 6)>
<4, (3, 6, 8)>
<6, (3, 4, 9)>
<7, (1, 8, 9)>
<8, (1, 4, 6)>
<9, (2, 3, 6)>
