Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 2

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph. 
We can see that node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 6, and 8. <0, (4, 6, 8)>
Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 5, and 7. <1, (2, 5, 7)>
Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 8, and 9. <2, (1, 8, 9)>
Node 3 does not form a 3-star as it has only two connections.
Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 7, and 6. <4, (0, 6, 7)>
Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, and 8. <5, (1, 3, 8)>
Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 7, and 4. <6, (0, 4, 7)>
Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, and 4. <7, (1, 3, 4)>
Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 2, and 5. <8, (0, 2, 5)>
Node 9 does not form a 3-star as it has only one connection.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
The unique 3-stars are <0, (4, 6, 8)>, <1, (2, 5, 7)>, <2, (1, 8, 9)>, <4, (0, 6, 7)>, <5, (1, 3, 8)>, and <8, (0, 2, 5)>.
