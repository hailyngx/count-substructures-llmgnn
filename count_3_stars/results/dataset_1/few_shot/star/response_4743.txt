Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible 3-stars. 

Let's list the 3-stars present in the graph:

<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<2, (0, 1, 7)>
<2, (0, 1, 8)>
<2, (3, 7, 8)>
<2, (3, 8, 9)>
<2, (7, 8, 9)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
