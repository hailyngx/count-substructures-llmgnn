Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 7, and node 8

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph step by step.

1. Node 0:
    - Node 0 is connected to nodes 1 and 9.
    - Thus, the possible 3-stars with node 0 as the center are:
        - <0, (1, 9)>

2. Node 1:
    - Node 1 is connected to nodes 0 and 2.
    - Thus, the possible 3-stars with node 1 as the center are:
        - <1, (0, 2)>

3. Node 2:
    - Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 8.
    - Thus, the possible 3-stars with node 2 as the center are:
        - <2, (1, 3, 8)>

4. Node 3:
    - Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 7, and 9.
    - Thus, the possible 3-stars with node 3 as the center are:
        - <3, (2, 7, 9)>

5. Node 4:
    - Node 4 is connected to nodes 7 and 9.
    - Thus, the possible 3-stars with node 4 as the center are:
        - <4, (7, 9)>

6. Node 7:
    - Node 7 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 9.
    - Thus, the possible 3-stars with node 7 as the center are:
        - <7, (3, 4, 9)>

7. Node 8:
    - Node 8 is connected to nodes 2 and 9.
    - Thus, the possible 3-stars with node 8 as the center are:
        - <8, (2, 9)>

8. Node 9:
    - Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, 7, and 8.
    - Thus, the possible 3-stars with node 9 as the center are:
        - <9, (0, 3, 8)>
        - <9, (4, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
