Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node and check if it forms a 3-star. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's go through each node one by one:

1. Node 0:
   - Forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 2, and 9
   <0, (1, 2, 9)>

2. Node 1:
   - Does not form a 3-star since it has four neighbors.

3. Node 2:
   - Does not form a 3-star since it has four neighbors.

4. Node 3:
   - Does not form a 3-star since it has only one neighbor.

5. Node 4:
   - Does not form a 3-star since it has only one neighbor.

6. Node 5:
   - Does not form a 3-star since it has only two neighbors.

7. Node 6:
   - Does not form a 3-star since it has four neighbors.

8. Node 7:
   - Does not form a 3-star since it has three neighbors, but one of them is already a leaf.

9. Node 8:
   - Does not form a 3-star since it has four neighbors.

10. Node 9:
   - Forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 6, and 8
   <9, (0, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
