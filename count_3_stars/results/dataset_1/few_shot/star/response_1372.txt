Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 6, and node 7

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph. 

Let's list down the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (4, 8, 9)>
<3, (4, 5, 7)>
<4, (0, 3, 7)>
<6, (5, 7, 9)>
<7, (1, 2, 9)>

Count of 3-star graphs: [5]
