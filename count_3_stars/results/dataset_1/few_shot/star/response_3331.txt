Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Based on the given graph and adjacency list, the 3-stars in the graph are as follows:

<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<0, (2, 3, 7)>
<0, (3, 4, 6)>
<0, (3, 6, 7)>
<0, (4, 6, 7)>
<3, (0, 6, 9)>
<4, (0, 6, 8)>
<6, (3, 4, 8)>
<6, (3, 6, 9)>
<6, (4, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
