Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 4

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Let's analyze each node to identify the 3-stars:

1. Node 0: Connected to nodes 1 and 5.
2. Node 1: Connected to nodes 0 and 8.
3. Node 2: Connected to node 4.
4. Node 3: Connected to node 4.
5. Node 4: Connected to nodes 2, 3, 7, and 9.
6. Node 5: Connected to nodes 0, 6, and 7.
7. Node 6: Connected to node 5.
8. Node 7: Connected to nodes 4 and 5.
9. Node 8: Connected to node 1.
10. Node 9: Connected to node 4.

Now, we can list the 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<4, (2, 3, 7)>
<4, (3, 7, 9)>
<5, (0, 6, 7)>

There are a total of [4] 3-stars in the given graph.
