Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list all the 3-stars in this graph:
<0, (2, 6, 9)>
<1, (8, 9, 2)>
<2, (0, 4, 5)>
<3, (2, 5, 7)>
<4, (2, 7, 8)>
<5, (2, 3, 8)>
<6, (0, 7, 9)>
<7, (3, 4, 6)>
<8, (1, 4, 5)>
<9, (1, 6, 8)>

Therefore, there are a total of [10] 3-stars in this graph.
