Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 8

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

There are 3-stars with the following central nodes and leaves:
<2, (1, 6, 7)>
<3, (0, 4, 6)>
<6, (2, 3, 4)>
<6, (3, 4, 5)>
<6, (2, 4, 8)>
<6, (3, 5, 8)>
<9, (1, 5, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
