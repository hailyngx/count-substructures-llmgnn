Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern.

Based on the provided information, let's identify the 3-stars:
<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<1, (4, 6, 9)>
<2, (1, 8, 4)>
<4, (1, 6, 8)>
<6, (1, 4, 5)>
<6, (3, 4, 5)>
<6, (5, 1, 9)>
<8, (0, 2, 4)>
<9, (1, 3, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
