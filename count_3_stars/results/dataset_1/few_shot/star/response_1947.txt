Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars present in this graph:

<0, (1, 3, 6)>
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<2, (1, 3, 5)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<5, (2, 4, 6)>
<6, (0, 5, 9)>
<8, (1, 2, 7)>
<9, (0, 3, 6)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we have a total of [8].
