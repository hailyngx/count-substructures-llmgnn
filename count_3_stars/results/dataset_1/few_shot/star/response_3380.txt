Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 4, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the 3-stars present in the graph. A 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Looking at the adjacency list and the definition of a 3-star, we can identify the following unique 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<0, (3, 4, 6)>
<4, (1, 5, 9)>
<6, (8, 9, 0)>
<9, (4, 7, 6)>

Count of 3-stars: [7]
