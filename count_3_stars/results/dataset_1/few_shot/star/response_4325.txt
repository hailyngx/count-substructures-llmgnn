Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes (creating a 3-star pattern).

Looking at the adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (5, 6, 7)>
<2, (5, 7, 9)>
<3, (4, 9, -)>
<4, (3, 9, -)>
<5, (0, 6, 7)>
<6, (0, 5, 7)>
<7, (0, 2, 5)>
<9, (2, 3, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
