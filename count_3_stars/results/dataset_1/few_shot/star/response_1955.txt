Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 1

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's go step by step:

1. Identify potential central nodes:
   - From the adjacency list, nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 have degrees that could potentially make them central nodes of 3-stars (i.e., connected to exactly three other nodes).

2. Analyze each potential central node:
   - For each potential central node, check its neighbors to see if they form 3-stars.
   - Check if the neighbors form 3-stars by being connected to exactly two other neighbors via edges.

Based on the given graph, the analysis leads to the following 3-stars:

<0, (2, 3, 9)>
<1, (5, 6, 7)>
<2, (4, 6, 8)>
<3, (4, 7, 0)>
<4, (2, 3, 5)>
<5, (1, 4, 0)>
<6, (7, 1, 2)>
<7, (1, 3, 6)>
<8, (1, 2, 0)>
<9, (0, 1, 0)>

Count of 3-stars in the graph: [10]

Therefore, the final answer is [10].
