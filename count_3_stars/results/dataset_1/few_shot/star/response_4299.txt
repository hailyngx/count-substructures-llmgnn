Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's analyze each node and its connections to identify any 3-stars. 

Let's start by looking at each node:

- Node 0 forms the following 3-stars:
  - <0, (1, 3, 8)>
  - <0, (5, 7, 8)>
  - <0, (7, 3, 8)>
  [3]

- Node 1 forms no 3-stars.

- Node 2 forms no 3-stars.

- Node 3 forms the following 3-stars:
  - <3, (0, 7, 8)>
  [1]

- Node 4 forms no 3-stars.

- Node 5 forms no 3-stars.

- Node 6 forms no 3-stars.

- Node 7 forms no 3-stars.

- Node 8 forms no 3-stars.

- Node 9 forms no 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
