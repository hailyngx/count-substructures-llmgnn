Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 5
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 6

Response:
Following the definition of a 3-star graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the given graph information, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<3, (4, 6, 7)>
<5, (0, 6, 7)>
<6, (3, 5, 9)>
<7, (3, 4, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
