Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for 3-stars centered at each node. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
1. For Node 0: <0, (1, 4, 6)>
2. For Node 1: <1, (0, 2, 5)>
3. For Node 2: <2, (1, 7, 8)>
4. For Node 3: No 3-star as it is connected to only 2 nodes.
5. For Node 4: <4, (0, 3, 6)>
6. For Node 5: No 3-star as it is connected to only 2 nodes.
7. For Node 6: <6, (0, 4, 9)>
8. For Node 7: <7, (0, 2, 8)>
9. For Node 8: <8, (2, 4, 9)>
10. For Node 9: <9, (0, 2, 3)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7]. The unique 3-stars found are <0, (1, 4, 6)>, <1, (0, 2, 5)>, <2, (1, 7, 8)>, <4, (0, 3, 6)>, <6, (0, 4, 9)>, <7, (0, 2, 8)>, and <8, (2, 4, 9)>.
