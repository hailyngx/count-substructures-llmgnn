Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 4, and node 5

Response:
Given the definition of a 3-star graph, we can count the number of 3-stars in the graph by identifying the central nodes and their corresponding leaves. Let's go through the nodes one by one to find all the 3-stars: 

- Node 0: <0, (2, 3, 6)>, <0, (2, 3, 8)>, and <0, (2, 3, 9)>
- Node 1: <1, (2, 3, 4)>, <1, (2, 3, 6)>, and <1, (2, 3, 7)>
- Node 2: <2, (0, 1, 3)>, <2, (0, 1, 4)>, <2, (3, 4, 9)>, <2, (5, 8, 9)>
- Node 3: <3, (0, 1, 2)>, <3, (0, 1, 7)>, and <3, (2, 4, 9)>
- Node 4: No 3-stars as the central node.
- Node 5: No 3-stars as the central node.
- Node 6: No 3-stars as the central node.
- Node 7: No 3-stars as the central node.
- Node 8: No 3-stars as the central node.
- Node 9: <9, (0, 2, 3)>, <9, (0, 2, 4)>, <9, (0, 3, 5)>, and <9, (2, 3, 5)>

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [13].
