Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 5

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a star structure. Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<0, (1, 3, 6)>
<0, (2, 3, 6)>
<1, (0, 3, 6)>
<1, (3, 4, 6)>
<2, (0, 4, 5)>
<2, (4, 5, 8)>
<3, (0, 1, 6)>
<3, (0, 6, 8)>
<3, (1, 6, 8)>
<3, (6, 7, 8)>
<4, (1, 2, 6)>
<5, (2, 7, 9)>
<6, (0, 1, 3)>
<6, (0, 3, 4)>
<6, (1, 3, 8)>
<7, (3, 5, 8)>
<8, (2, 3, 6)>
<8, (3, 6, 7)>
<9, (0, 5, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [19].
