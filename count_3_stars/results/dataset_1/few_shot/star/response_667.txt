Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can identify the central node first and then check for adjacent nodes connected to that central node. 

Given the graph, we have the following central nodes with their adjacent nodes:

- Central Node 0: Adjacent nodes 6 and 9
- Central Node 1: Adjacent nodes 5 and 7
- Central Node 2: Adjacent nodes 3, 4, and 9
- Central Node 3: Adjacent nodes 2, 7, and 9
- Central Node 4: Adjacent nodes 2 and 6
- Central Node 5: Adjacent nodes 1 and 6
- Central Node 6: Adjacent nodes 0, 4, 5, and 7
- Central Node 7: Adjacent nodes 1, 3, 6, 8, and 9
- Central Node 8: Adjacent node 7
- Central Node 9: Adjacent nodes 0, 2, 3, and 7

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:
<0, (6, 9)>
<1, (5, 7)>
<2, (3, 4, 9)>
<3, (2, 7, 9)>
<6, (4, 5, 7)>
<7, (1, 3, 9)>

Therefore, the final answer is [6].
