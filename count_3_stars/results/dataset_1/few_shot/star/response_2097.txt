Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all 3-stars. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to three other nodes. We will list the unique 3-stars found in the graph.

Given the adjacency list and edge information, we can determine the 3-stars:

<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<1, (0, 3, 5)>
<3, (0, 1, 4)>
<5, (0, 1, 7)>
<7, (0, 1, 5)>
<9, (1, 2, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
