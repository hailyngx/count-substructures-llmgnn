Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes. Let's go step by step:

1. Node 0 is not part of any 3-star structure since it is connected to 3 nodes but no other node is connected to exactly 3 nodes through node 0.

2. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 6, and 7. Hence, we have <1, (4, 6, 7)>.

3. Node 2 is not part of any 3-star structure since it is connected to only 2 other nodes.

4. Node 3 is not part of any 3-star structure since it is connected to only 1 other node.

5. Node 4 is not a part of any additional 3-star structure apart from the <1, (4, 6, 7)> we found earlier.

6. Node 5 is not part of any 3-star structure since it is connected to 2 other nodes.

7. Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 4, and 7. Hence, we have <6, (0, 4, 7)>.

8. Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 6, and 9. Hence, we have <7, (1, 6, 9)>.

9. Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 7, and 9. Therefore, we have <8, (1, 7, 9)>.

10. Node 9 is not part of any additional 3-star structure apart from the ones we found earlier.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3]. The unique 3-stars found are <1, (4, 6, 7)>, <6, (0, 4, 7)>, and <7, (1, 6, 9)>.
