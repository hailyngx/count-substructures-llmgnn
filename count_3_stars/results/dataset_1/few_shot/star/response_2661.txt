Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible combinations of central nodes and their three connected nodes. 

Based on the provided information, the possible 3-star combinations are:
<0, (1, 5, 9)>
<1, (0, 9, 2)>
<2, (0, 3, 8)>
<2, (3, 4, 6)>
<3, (2, 6, 9)>
<4, (2)>
<5, (0)>
<6, (2, 3)>
<7, (9)>
<8, (2)>
<9, (0, 1, 3, 7)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we get a total of [9]. 
Therefore, the final answer is [9].
