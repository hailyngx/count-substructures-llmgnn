Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 7

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

First, let's find the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 0: (0, 1, 6), (0, 3, 7), (0, 6, 7) 
2. Node 1: (1, 0, 6), (1, 4, 8), (1, 6, 8)
3. Node 4: (4, 1, 8), (4, 3, 9), (4, 5, 8), (4, 6, 9)
4. Node 6: (6, 0, 7), (6, 1, 7), (6, 2, -), (6, 4, -), (6, 7, -)
5. Node 7: (7, 0, -), (7, 5, -), (7, 6, -), (7, 8, 9), (7, 9, -)
6. Node 8: (8, 1, -), (8, 4, -), (8, 5, -), (8, 7, -)
7. Node 9: (9, 4, -), (9, 7, -)

So, the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph is [15].
  
Therefore, the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 6, 7)>, <0, (3, 7, -)>, <1, (0, 6, 8)>, <4, (1, 8, -)>, <4, (3, 9, -)>, <4, (5, 8, -)>, <4, (6, 9, -)>, <6, (0, 7, -)>, <6, (1, 7, -)>, <7, (0, -, -)>, <7, (5, -, -)>, <7, (8, 9, -)>, <8, (1, -, -)>, <9, (4, -, -)>.
