Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 8

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that can be the center of a 3-star in this graph. 
A 3-star must have exactly 3 leaves and a center node connected to each of these leaves. So, we need to find nodes that have exactly 3 neighbors. 

Looking at the adjacency list:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors
- Node 2 has 0 neighbors
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors (can be the center)
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors
- Node 8 has 1 neighbor
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

Therefore, nodes 3 and 9 are the only potential center nodes for a 3-star.

Now, let's find the 3-stars in the graph. We will consider each potential center node individually. 

For node 3:
- (3, 0, 4, 5)
- (3, 0, 5, 9)
- (3, 4, 5, 9)

For node 9:
- (9, 1, 3, 5)
- (9, 1, 3, 8)
- (9, 3, 5, 8)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].

<3, (0, 4, 5)>
<3, (0, 5, 9)>
<3, (4, 5, 9)>
<9, (1, 3, 5)>
<9, (1, 3, 8)>
<9, (3, 5, 8)>
