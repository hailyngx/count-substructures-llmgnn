Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes in a star-like configuration. 

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<1, (3, 6, 7)>
<2, (3, 4, 7)>
<3, (1, 2, 6)>
<4, (2, 5, 7)>
<5, (3, 4, 8)>
<6, (1, 3, 8)>
<7, (1, 2, 8)>
<8, (5, 6, 7)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars: [8]
