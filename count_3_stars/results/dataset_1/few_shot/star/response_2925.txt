Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 6
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 1

Response:
To find the 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node and the three leaves connected to it. Let's go step by step:

1. Identify all nodes in the graph that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
   - Node 0 is connected to 2 other nodes.
   - Node 1 is connected to 2 other nodes.
   - Node 2 is connected to 1 other node.
   - Node 3 is connected to 4 other nodes.
   - Node 4 is connected to 2 other nodes.
   - Node 5 is connected to 1 other node.
   - Node 6 is connected to 3 other nodes.
   - Node 7 is connected to 1 other node.
   - Node 9 is connected to 2 other nodes.

2. Now, let's list the 3-stars in the graph. We will consider each node as the potential central node and check if it forms a 3-star. 

   2.1. For Node 0:
   - Node 0 is not a central node of any 3-star because it is only connected to 2 other nodes.

   2.2. For Node 1:
   - Node 1 is not a central node of any 3-star because it is only connected to 2 other nodes.

   2.3. For Node 3:
   - <3, (0, 4, 5)>
   - <3, (0, 6, 9)>

   2.4. For Node 6:
   - <6, (1, 3, 7)>

3. Counting the number of 3-stars: [3]
