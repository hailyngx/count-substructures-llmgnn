Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

From the provided information, we can see that node 0, node 2, and node 9 are potential center nodes for 3-stars since they each have 3 neighbors. Let's now list the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<0, (1, 4, 9)>
<0, (1, 5, 9)>
<0, (4, 5, 9)>

<2, (1, 4, 6)>
<2, (1, 4, 7)>
<2, (1, 6, 7)>
<2, (4, 6, 7)>
<2, (6, 7, 9)>
<2, (7, 8, 9)>

<9, (0, 2, 3)>
<9, (0, 2, 7)>
<9, (0, 3, 7)>
<9, (2, 3, 7)>
<9, (3, 7, 8)>

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is therefore [15].
