Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 7

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 

Looking at the adjacency list of each node:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 9.
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 8.
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 8, 9.
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 5, 9.
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, 4.

These are the unique 3-stars in the given graph:
<0, (3, 9)> 
<1, (9, 8)>
<4, (5, 8, 9)>
<7, (2, 5, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
