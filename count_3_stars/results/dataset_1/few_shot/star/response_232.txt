Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 8

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes forming a star pattern. Let's go step by step:

1. Node 0 forms 3-stars with nodes 2, 4, 5. <0, (2, 4, 5)>
2. Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 4, 0. <3, (5, 4, 0)>
3. Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 2, 9. <8, (1, 2, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
