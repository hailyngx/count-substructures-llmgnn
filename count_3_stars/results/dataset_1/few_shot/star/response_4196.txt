Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 4, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Upon examining the adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars: 
<0, (2, 3, 5)>
<2, (0, 5, 9)>
<5, (0, 2, 9)>
<8, (3, 4, 9)>

Hence, there are [4] total 3-stars in the given graph.
