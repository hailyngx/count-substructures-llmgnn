Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 8

Response:
First, let's find all the 3-stars in the given graph by identifying the central node and its connected nodes. 

Let's list out all the 3-stars that can be found in this graph:

<1, (2, 6, 8)>
<1, (2, 8, 9)>
<1, (6, 8, 9)>
<2, (1, 4, 5)>
<2, (1, 5, 7)>
<2, (4, 5, 9)>
<2, (5, 7, 9)>
<8, (1, 3, 9)>
<8, (3, 7, 9)>
<8, (7, 9, 2)>
<9, (1, 2, 5)>
<9, (1, 2, 8)>
<9, (2, 5, 8)>
<9, (5, 8, 9)>

Counting all the unique 3-stars, we get a total of [14].
