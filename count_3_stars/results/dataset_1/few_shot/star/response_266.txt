Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star in the graph. A 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's find the 3-stars in the graph:
- The central nodes in this graph are: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<0, (3, 6, 8)>
<1, (4, 6, 9)>
<2, (4, 7, 2)>
<4, (1, 2, 5)>
<5, (4, 8, 5)>
<6, (0, 1, 7)>
<7, (2, 6, 9)>
<8, (0, 4, 5)>
<9, (1, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
