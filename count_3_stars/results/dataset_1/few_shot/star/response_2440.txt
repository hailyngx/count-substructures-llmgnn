Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 4

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can identify all the 3-stars by locating the central nodes and their corresponding leaves. 
Let's iterate through each node as the potential central node and count the number of 3-stars.

<1, (4, 5, 6)>
<4, (1, 6, 7)>
<4, (1, 6, 9)>
<6, (1, 4, 2)>
