Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5

Response:
There are a total of 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

The 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 4, 7)>
<1, (0, 4, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
