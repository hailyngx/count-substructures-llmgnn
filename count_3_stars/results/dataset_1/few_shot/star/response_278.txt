Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 3
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 4, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

We can see that nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, and 9 are all connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list the unique 3-stars:

<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<2, (5, 8, 9)>
<3, (5, 7, 9)>
<4, (0, 8, 9)>
<9, (0, 2, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
