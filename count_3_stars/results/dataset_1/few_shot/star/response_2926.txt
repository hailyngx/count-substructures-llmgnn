Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 2

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible combinations where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step by step:

1. Examine each node in the graph:
   - Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 6, and 8. <0, (2, 6, 8)>
   - Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 8, and 9. <2, (0, 8, 9)>
   - Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 6, and 7. <3, (5, 6, 7)>
   - Node 4 does not form a 3-star as it is only connected to 2 nodes.
   - Node 5 does not form a 3-star as it is already part of the 3-star with node 3.
   - Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 3, and 7. <6, (0, 3, 7)>
   - Node 7 does not form a 3-star as it is already part of the 3-star with node 3.
   - Node 8 does not form a 3-star as it is already part of the 3-star with node 0.
   - Node 9 does not form a 3-star as it is only connected to 2 nodes.

2. Final count of 3-stars: [3]

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the graph are:
<0, (2, 6, 8)>
<2, (0, 8, 9)>
<3, (5, 6, 7)>
