Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern where the central node is connected to three leaf nodes.

First, let's list all the 3-stars in the given graph.

<1, (2, 5, 8)>
<2, (1, 4, 8)>
<4, (2, 6, 8)>
<8, (1, 2, 4)>

Now, we count the total number of unique 3-stars listed above and provide the answer inside brackets.
[4]
