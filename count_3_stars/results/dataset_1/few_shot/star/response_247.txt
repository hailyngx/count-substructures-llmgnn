Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (9, 2) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 5

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first identify the 3-star structures in the graph:

1. Node 0 forms a 3-star: <0, (4, 7)>
2. Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (4, 5)>
3. Node 4 forms a 3-star: <4, (0, 1, 7)>
4. Node 2 forms a 3-star: <2, (3, 9)>
5. Node 5 forms a 3-star: <5, (1, 9)>
6. Node 7 forms a 3-star: <7, (0, 4)>
7. Node 9 forms a 3-star: <9, (2, 5)>

These are all the 3-stars present in the graph. Counting them, we find a total of [7] 3-stars.
