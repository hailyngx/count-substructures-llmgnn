Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern.

Looking at the adjacency list, we can see which nodes are connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 9
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 6, 7, and 8
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 9
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 8, and 9
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 7, and 9
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 6, 7, and 8

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars by examining each set of connections between a node and its three neighbors:
- From Node 0: <0, (4, 5, 9)>
- From Node 4: <4, (0, 3, 9)>
- From Node 7: <7, (1, 3, 8)>
- From Node 8: <8, (1, 5, 9)>
- From Node 9: <9, (0, 4, 6)>, <9, (0, 4, 7)>, <9, (0, 4, 8)>, <9, (6, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7]. 
The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (4, 5, 9)>, <4, (0, 3, 9)>, <7, (1, 3, 8)>, <8, (1, 5, 9)>, <9, (0, 4, 6)>, <9, (0, 4, 7)>, <9, (0, 4, 8)>, <9, (6, 7, 8)>.
