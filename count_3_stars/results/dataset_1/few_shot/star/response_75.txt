Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 8
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 3

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are as follows:
<[0, (1, 3, 7)]> - This is a 3-star centered at node 0 with leaves 1, 3, and 7.
<[2, (4, 8, 9)]> - This is a 3-star centered at node 2 with leaves 4, 8, and 9.
<[3, (0, 4, 9)]> - This is a 3-star centered at node 3 with leaves 0, 4, and 9.
So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
