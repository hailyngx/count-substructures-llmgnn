Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<1, (0, 5, 6)>
<1, (5, 6, 9)>
<5, (0, 1, 6)>
<5, (0, 2, 8)>
<5, (1, 2, 6)>
<5, (6, 8, 0)>
<6, (0, 1, 5)>
<6, (1, 5, 9)>
<9, (1, 2, 6)>

By counting the unique 3-stars found, we get a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
