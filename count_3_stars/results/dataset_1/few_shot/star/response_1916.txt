Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node:

Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 8

Response:
The total number of 3-star configurations can be found by counting the number of 3-stars at each node and summing them up. Let's go through each node to count the 3-stars:

For Node 0:
- <0, (1, 6, 7)>
- <0, (1, 6, 8)>
- <0, (1, 7, 8)>
Total: 3

For Node 1:
- <1, (0, 3, 4)>
- <1, (0, 3, 7)>
Total: 2

For Node 2:
- <2, (3, 5, 6)>
- <2, (3, 6, 7)>
- <2, (3, 7, 8)>
Total: 3

For Node 3:
- <3, (1, 2, 4)>
- <3, (1, 4, 7)>
- <3, (2, 4, 5)>
- <3, (2, 5, 6)>
- <3, (2, 6, 7)>
- <3, (2, 6, 8)>
- <3, (2, 7, 8)>
- <3, (4, 5, 6)>
- <3, (4, 6, 7)>
- <3, (5, 6, 7)>
Total: 10

For Node 4:
- <4, (1, 3, 9)>
Total: 1

For Node 5:
- <5, (2, 3, 9)>
Total: 1

For Node 6:
- <6, (0, 2, 3)>
- <6, (0, 2, 7)>
- <6, (0, 3, 7)>
- <6, (2, 3, 7)>
Total: 4

For Node 7:
- <7, (0, 1, 6)>
- <7, (0, 3, 6)>
- <7, (1, 2, 3)>
- <7, (1, 3, 6)>
- <7, (2, 3, 6)>
- <7, (3, 6, 7)>
Total: 6

For Node 8:
- <8, (0, 2, 9)>
Total: 1

For Node 9:
- <9, (4, 5, 8)>
Total: 1

Adding up the totals from each node, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [29].

Therefore, the unique 3-star configurations are:
<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<0, (1, 6, 8)>
<0, (1, 7, 8)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<1, (0, 3, 7)>
<2, (3, 5, 6)>
<2, (3, 6, 7)>
<2, (3, 7, 8)>
<3, (1, 2, 4)>
<3, (1, 4, 7)>
<3, (2, 4, 5)>
<3, (2, 5, 6)>
<3, (2, 6, 7)>
<3, (2, 6, 8)>
<3, (2, 7, 8)>
<3, (4, 5, 6)>
<3, (4, 6, 7)>
<3, (5, 6, 7)>
<4, (1, 3, 9)>
<5, (2, 3, 9)>
<6, (0, 2, 3)>
<6, (0, 2, 7)>
<6, (0, 3, 7)>
<6, (2, 3, 7)>
<7, (0, 1, 6)>
<7, (0, 3, 6)>
<7, (1, 2, 3)>
<7, (1, 3, 6)>
<7, (2, 3, 6)>
<7, (3, 6, 7)>
<8, (0, 2, 9)>
<9, (4, 5, 8)>
