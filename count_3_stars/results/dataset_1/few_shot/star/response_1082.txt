Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify patterns where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through each node to find all the 3-stars:

For Node 0:
- <0, (2, 3, 4)> (Node 0 is the center)

For Node 1:
- <1, (2, 3, 8)> (Node 1 is the center)

For Node 2:
- <2, (0, 1, 3)>
- <2, (5, 8, 9)> 

For Node 3:
- <3, (0, 1, 8)>
- <3, (2, 7, 8)>

For Node 4:
- No 3-star

For Node 5:
- No 3-star

For Node 6:
- No 3-star

For Node 7:
- <7, (3, 4, 8)>
- <7, (6, 8, 9)>

For Node 8:
- <8, (1, 2, 3)>
- <8, (7, 9, 2)>

For Node 9:
- No 3-star

Combining all the unique 3-stars identified, we get: <0, (2, 3, 4)>, <1, (2, 3, 8)>, <2, (0, 1, 3)>, <2, (5, 8, 9)>, <3, (0, 1, 8)>, <3, (2, 7, 8)>, <7, (3, 4, 8)>, <7, (6, 8, 9)>, <8, (1, 2, 3)>, <8, (7, 9, 2)>
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
