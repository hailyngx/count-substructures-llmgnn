Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 6
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 8

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible 3-star configurations.

Let's list all unique 3-stars in this graph:
<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<1, (0, 2, 6)>
<2, (0, 1, 6)>
<4, (0, 1, 6)>
<6, (0, 1, 2)>
<7, (0, 5, 6)>
<8, (6, 9)>
<9, (1, 8)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars in the graph, we get [8].
