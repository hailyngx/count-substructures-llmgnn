Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 9
