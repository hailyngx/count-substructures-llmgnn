Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 4, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 4, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for every possible 3-star configuration, which consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
- <0, (2, 7, 9)>
- <1, (4, 3, 5)>
- <1, (4, 5, 6)>
- <3, (4, 5, 9)>
- <6, (4, 5, 7)>

Total number of 3-stars: [5]
