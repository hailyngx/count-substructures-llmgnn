Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 7

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes (nodes with exactly three neighbors) in the graph. Based on the adjacency list and the given edges, we can see that the central nodes are: 0, 3, 5, and 7.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:

1. For central node 0:
    - (0, 4, 6, 7)
    - (0, 4, 6, 9)
    - (0, 6, 7, 9)
    - (0, 4, 7, 9)
    --> Total: 4

2. For central node 3:
    - (3, 4, 5, 6)
    - (3, 4, 5, 7)
    - (3, 4, 6, 7)
    - (3, 5, 6, 7)
    --> Total: 4

3. For central node 5:
    - (5, 2, 3, 7)
    - (5, 3, 4, 7)
    --> Total: 2

4. For central node 7:
    - (7, 0, 1, 9)
    - (7, 0, 3, 5)
    - (7, 0, 3, 9)
    - (7, 0, 5, 9)
    --> Total: 4

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4 + 4 + 2 + 4] = 14.
