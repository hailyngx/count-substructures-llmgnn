Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for each node that has exactly three neighbors and see if they form a 3-star centered at that node. 

Starting from node 0 and going through all nodes up to node 9, we find the following 3-stars:
<0, (2, 5, 8)>
<1, (2, 3, 5)>
<2, (0, 1, 4)>
<3, (1, 4, 6)>
<5, (0, 1, 4)>
<6, (3, 4, 7)>
<8, (0, 4, 7)>
<9, (2, 4, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8]. 
<0, (2, 5, 8)>, <1, (2, 3, 5)>, <2, (0, 1, 4)>, <3, (1, 4, 6)>, <5, (0, 1, 4)>, <6, (3, 4, 7)>, <8, (0, 4, 7)>, <9, (2, 4, 8)>
