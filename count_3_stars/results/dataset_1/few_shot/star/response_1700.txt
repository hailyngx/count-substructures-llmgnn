Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 4

Response:
Given the graph information, let's determine the number of 3-stars in the graph:

1. Nodes that are part of a 3-star must have degree >= 3 since they need at least 3 edges.
2. Let's check the nodes' degrees:
   - Node 0: degree 2
   - Node 1: degree 4
   - Node 2: degree 2
   - Node 3: degree 4
   - Node 4: degree 5
   - Node 5: degree 1
   - Node 6: degree 2
   - Node 7: degree 1
   - Node 8: degree 2
   - Node 9: degree 3
3. Nodes 1, 3, and 4 are the only nodes with degrees >= 3, so they can be centers of 3-stars.
4. Let's find the 3-stars:
   - For Node 1: (1, 0, 3, 9) and (1, 4, 8, 9) are the only possibilities.
   - For Node 3: (3, 0, 2, 9) and (3, 4, 9, 9) are the possibilities.
   - For Node 4: (4, 1, 2, 9) and (4, 3, 6, 9) are the possibilities.
5. Counting the unique 3-stars, we have the following:
   - <1, (0, 3, 9)>
   - <1, (4, 8, 9)>
   - <3, (0, 2, 9)>
   - <3, (4, 9, 9)>
   - <4, (1, 2, 9)>
   - <4, (3, 6, 9)>
6. Therefore, there are [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
