Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node and its adjacent nodes for each 3-star. We will then list the unique 3-stars found.

Let's start by identifying the 3-stars:

1. Node 0:
   - <0, (1, 2, 4)>

2. Node 2:
   - <2, (0, 1, 3)>

3. Node 3:
   - <3, (2, 6, 8)>
  
4. Node 4:
   - <4, (0, 6, 9)>

5. Node 6:
   - <6, (3, 4, 9)>

6. Node 8:
   - <8, (3, 7, 9)>

From the identified 3-stars, we see that there are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the final answer is [6].
