Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 6, and node 7

Response:
We are looking for 3-star subgraphs in this graph. Let's find and count them step by step:

- Node 1 can form 3-stars with nodes 3, 6, and 5.
- Node 2 can form 3-stars with nodes 4, 6, and 7.
- Node 3 can form 3-stars with nodes 1, 4, and 8.
- Node 6 can form 3-stars with nodes 1, 2, and 9.
- Node 7 can form a 3-star with nodes 2 and 9.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5]. 

Unique 3-stars found:
<1, (3, 5, 6)>
<2, (4, 6, 7)>
<3, (1, 4, 8)>
<6, (1, 2, 9)>
<7, (2, 7, 9)>
