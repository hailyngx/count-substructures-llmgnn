Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's identify the 3-stars first. 

A 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list the possible 3-stars in this graph:

<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<1, (0, 4, 7)>
<2, (1, 5, -)>
<3, (5, -, -)>
<4, (0, 1, 6)>
<5, (2, 3, 7)>
<6, (1, 4, -)>
<7, (1, 5, 8)>
<8, (4, 7, -)>
<9, (4, 5, 7)>

Count of 3-stars in the given graph: [9]
