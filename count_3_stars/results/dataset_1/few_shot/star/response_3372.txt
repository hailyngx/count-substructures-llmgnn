Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, and node 7

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.
Since a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can look for nodes with exactly three neighbors. 

In this graph, the nodes with exactly three neighbors are:
- Node 2
- Node 6
- Node 7
- Node 8
- Node 9

Next, we can find the 3-stars centered at each of these nodes:
- From Node 2: <2, (3, 8, 9)>
- From Node 6: <6, (4, 7, 8)> and <6, (5, 8, 9)>
- From Node 7: <7, (1, 4, 8)> and <7, (1, 8, 9)>
- From Node 8: <8, (1, 2, 7)>
- From Node 9: <9, (2, 3, 6)> and <9, (7, 8, 6)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we have found a total of [7] 3-stars in the given graph.
