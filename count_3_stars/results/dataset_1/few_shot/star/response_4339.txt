Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 5, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the provided information, we can see that nodes 0, 1, 9, and 6 are each connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes can act as the centers of 3-stars. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in this graph:
<0, (1, 5, 9)>
<1, (0, 6, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 5)>
<6, (1, 7, 9)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars in the graph, we get [4].
