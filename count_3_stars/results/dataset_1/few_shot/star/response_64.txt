Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 8

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (2, 4, 8)>
2. <2, (0, 6, 7)>
3. <4, (0, 6, 7)>
4. <6, (1, 2, 4)>
5. <7, (1, 2, 4)>
6. <8, (0, 2, 9)>
7. <9, (2, 3, 4)>

There are a total of [7] 3-stars in the graph.
