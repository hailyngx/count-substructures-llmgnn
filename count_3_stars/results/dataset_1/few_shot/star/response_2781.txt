Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of nodes that form 3-stars. 

Let's first list out all the possible 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (2, 5, 7)>
<1, (3, 6, 7)>
<2, (0, 3, 4)>
<3, (1, 2, 4)>
<3, (4, 5, 7)>
<3, (5, 7, 9)>
<3, (7, 9, 1)>
<3, (9, 6, 4)>
<5, (0, 3, 7)>
<6, (1, 8, 9)>
<7, (0, 1, 3)>
<8, (3, 6, 9)>
<9, (3, 5, 7)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars found:
