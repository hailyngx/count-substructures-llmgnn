Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 1
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 4

Response:
Given the graph and its adjacency list, we can identify the 3-stars present in the graph. 

Let's analyze the graph step by step:

1. Identify nodes with exactly 3 neighbors:
   - Node 1 has 3 neighbors (2, 6, 7).
   - Node 2 has 3 neighbors (1, 3, 4).
   - Node 4 has 3 neighbors (2, 3, 9).
   
2. For each of the identified nodes, check if they form a 3-star:
   - 3-star with center node 1: <1, (2, 6, 7)>
   - 3-star with center node 2: <2, (1, 3, 4)>
   - 3-star with center node 4: <4, (2, 3, 9)>

Counting the unique 3-stars found, we get a total of [3].
