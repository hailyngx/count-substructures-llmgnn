Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 2

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will be the centers of potential 3-star subgraphs.

2. For each of these identified nodes, check if they are connected to exactly three nodes by edges.

3. If all conditions are met, then we have found a 3-star subgraph.

Let's follow these steps for the given graph:

Potential 3-star centers with exactly 3 connections:
- Node 0 (connected to 3 nodes)
- Node 2 (connected to 4 nodes)
- Node 7 (connected to 5 nodes)

Checking each potential center:
- For Node 0: (0, 4, 6, 7) forms a 3-star. <0, (4, 6, 7)>
- For Node 2: (2, 4, 5, 7) does not form a 3-star as it is connected to 4 nodes.
- For Node 7: (7, 0, 2, 4) forms a 3-star. <7, (0, 2, 4)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
The unique 3-stars found are: <<0, (4, 6, 7)>, <7, (0, 2, 4)>>.
