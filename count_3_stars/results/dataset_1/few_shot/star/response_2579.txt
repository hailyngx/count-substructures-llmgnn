Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 6, and node 7

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 2, and 6: <0, (1, 2, 6)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 4, and 5: <1, (0, 4, 5)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 5, and 6: <2, (0, 5, 6)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 5, and 7: <8, (1, 5, 7)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 3, and 6: <9, (0, 3, 6)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph.
