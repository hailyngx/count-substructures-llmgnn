Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 6
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
The 3-star graph can be identified by locating nodes with exactly three connections, where one of the connections is shared among all three nodes. In this case, the central node will have 3 connections, and the other 3 nodes will only be connected to the central node.

In the given graph with 10 nodes and 22 edges, the only 3-star configuration that exists is:
<2, (3, 4, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1].
