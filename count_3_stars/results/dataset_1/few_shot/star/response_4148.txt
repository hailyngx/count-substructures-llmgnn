Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 46 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify all the unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Based on the provided information, the 3-star configurations in this graph are as follows:
<0, (1, 4, 8)>
<1, (0, 2, 5)>
<2, (1, 3, 7)>
<3, (2, 4, 8)>
<4, (0, 3, 5)>
<5, (1, 4, 6)>
<6, (5, 7, 8)>
<7, (2, 6, 8)>
<8, (0, 1, 3)>
<9, (1, 2, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
