Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 7

Response:
We can identify 3-stars by looking for central nodes connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list the 3-stars found in the given graph:

<0, (2, 5, 8)>
<1, (2, 3, n/a)>
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<2, (0, 3, 9)>
<2, (1, 3, 9)>
<3, (1, 2, n/a)>
<4, (6, 9, n/a)>
<9, (2, 4, 7)>

Count of 3-stars: [8]
