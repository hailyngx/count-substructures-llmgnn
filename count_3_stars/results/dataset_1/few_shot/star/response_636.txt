Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 4
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 3

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the 3-stars. 

Let's first list the unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 5, 9)>
<1, (0, 5, 8)>
<3, (4, 8, 9)>
<4, (3, 5, 6)>
<5, (0, 1, 4)>
<8, (1, 3, 5)>
<9, (0, 3)>

There are a total of [6] 3-stars in the graph.
