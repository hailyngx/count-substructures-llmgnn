Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1

Response:
First, we identify the central nodes and their corresponding leaves based on the definition of a 3-star graph.

Central Node: Node 1, Node 5, Node 8

1. For Node 1:
<1, (3, 4, 5)>
<1, (3, 6, 8)>
<1, (4, 6, 8)>
<1, (5, 8, 9)>

2. For Node 5:
<5, (0, 1, 8)>

3. For Node 8:
<8, (1, 5, 6)>

Total number of 3-stars: [8]
