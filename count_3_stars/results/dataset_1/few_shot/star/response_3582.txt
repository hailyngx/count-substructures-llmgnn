Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars by finding nodes that are connected in a star configuration. 

The 3-stars in this graph are as follows:
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<3, (1, 7, 9)>
<6, (4, 5, 9)>
<7, (3, 9, 1)>
