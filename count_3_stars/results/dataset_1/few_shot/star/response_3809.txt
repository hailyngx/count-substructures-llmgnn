Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 7

Response:
The 3-stars in the graph are as follows:

<0, (9, 4, 7)>
<1, (5, 3, 6)>
<2, (4, 8, 9)>
<5, (1, 3, 6)>
