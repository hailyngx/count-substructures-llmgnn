Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 2
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 4, and 6 <0, (2, 4, 6)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 4, and 5 <1, (3, 4, 5)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 4, and 6 <3, (1, 4, 6)>

Therefore, there are [3] 3-stars in the given graph.
