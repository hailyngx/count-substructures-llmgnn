Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 9) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the graph description and adjacency list provided, we can see that the nodes with this property are nodes 0, 1, 6, and 9. These nodes have degree 6, as they are each connected to exactly 6 other nodes.

Let's now list the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (1, 6, 8)>
<0, (1, 6, 9)>
<0, (1, 7, 9)>
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<1, (0, 6, 8)>
<1, (0, 6, 9)>
<1, (3, 6, 8)>
<1, (3, 6, 9)>
<6, (0, 1, 8)>
<6, (0, 1, 9)>
<6, (0, 8, 9)>
<9, (0, 4, 5)>
<9, (0, 5, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [13].
