Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to find all occurrences of 3-stars. 

Let's list all the 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<1, (3, 6, 7)>
<3, (1, 7, 8)>
<7, (1, 2, 3)>
<9, (0, 6, 7)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars.
