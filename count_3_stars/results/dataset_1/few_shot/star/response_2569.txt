Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 5, and node 7

Response:
Let's find the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

The 3-stars in this graph are formed by a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.
Looking at the adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (5, 6, 7)>
<0, (5, 7, 9)>
<0, (5, 6, 9)>
<0, (7, 5, 9)>
<5, (0, 6, 7)>
<5, (0, 7, 9)>
<5, (0, 6, 9)>
<5, (7, 0, 9)>
<6, (0, 5, 1)>
<6, (0, 5, 9)>
<6, (5, 0, 1)>
<6, (5, 0, 9)>
<7, (0, 5, 9)>
<9, (0, 5, 7)>
<9, (0, 5, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].
