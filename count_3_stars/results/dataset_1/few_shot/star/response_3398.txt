Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 3

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify the 3-stars. Remember, a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list the 3-stars based on the given information:
<0, (2, 4, 8)>
<1, (6, 5, 7)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
