Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for all possible combinations of three nodes connected to a central node. Since we are looking for 3-stars, the central node must be connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (2, 4, 7)>
2. <0, (2, 4, 8)>
3. <0, (4, 7, 8)>
4. <4, (0, 3, 5)>
5. <4, (0, 5, 7)>
6. <4, (3, 5, 7)>
7. <4, (5, 7, 8)>
8. <5, (0, 4, 8)>
9. <5, (4, 7, 9)>
  
Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the given graph.
