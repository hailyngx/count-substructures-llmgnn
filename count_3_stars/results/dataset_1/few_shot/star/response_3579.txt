Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 5
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's identify the unique 3-stars in the graph step by step:

1. Node 0: (0, 6, 8)
2. Node 1: (1, 3, 4), (1, 3, 8), (1, 4, 8)
3. Node 2: No 3-star as it is only connected to one node.
4. Node 3: (3, 1, 4), (3, 1, 8), (3, 4, 7), (3, 4, 8), (3, 7, 8)
5. Node 4: (4, 1, 3), (4, 1, 8), (4, 3, 5)
6. Node 5: (5, 4, 8)
7. Node 6: (6, 0, 7)
8. Node 7: (7, 2, 3), (7, 3, 6), (7, 3, 8)
9. Node 8: (8, 0, 5)

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the graph are: 
<0, (6, 8)>
<1, (3, 4, 8)>
<3, (1, 4, 8)>
<3, (4, 7, 8)>
<3, (1, 8, 3)>
<4, (1, 3, 8)>
<6, (0, 7, 6)>
<7, (2, 3, 7)>
<8, (0, 1, 5)>

There are [9] 3-stars in total.
