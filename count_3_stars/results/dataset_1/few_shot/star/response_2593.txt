Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 8) (4, 0) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 6

Response:
The given graph contains the following 3-stars: 
[<0, (4, 7, 8)>, <1, (6, 9, -)>]

Count of 3-stars: [2]
