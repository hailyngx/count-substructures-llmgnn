Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 8

Response:
Let's first identify all 3-stars in this graph:

- There are no 3-stars centered at Node 0.
- There is one 3-star centered at Node 1: <1, (0, 2, 4)>
- There are no 3-stars centered at Node 2.
- There are no 3-stars centered at Node 3.
- There are two 3-stars centered at Node 4: <4, (0, 1, 2)> and <4, (6, 8, 9)>
- There is one 3-star centered at Node 5: <5, (3, 8, 9)>
- There are no 3-stars centered at Node 6.
- There are no 3-stars centered at Node 7.
- There are two 3-stars centered at Node 8: <8, (1, 4, 5)> and <8, (6, 9, 4)>
- There are no 3-stars centered at Node 9.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6]. 

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<1, (0, 2, 4)>, 
<4, (0, 1, 2)>, 
<4, (6, 8, 9)>, 
<5, (3, 8, 9)>, 
<8, (1, 4, 5)>, 
<8, (6, 9, 4)>.
