Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will serve as the central nodes of the 3-stars.

Looking at the adjacency list provided, we can identify the following nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 3 (connected to nodes 0, 1, and 4)
- Node 8 (connected to nodes 0, 1, and 2)
- Node 9 (connected to nodes 0, 1, and 2)

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:

1. For Node 3: Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 4. Therefore, the 3-star for Node 3 is <3, (0, 1, 4)>.

2. For Node 8: Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 2. Therefore, the 3-star for Node 8 is <8, (0, 1, 2)>.

3. For Node 9: Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 2. Therefore, the 3-star for Node 9 is <9, (0, 1, 2)>.

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 3. 
So, the answer is [3].

The unique 3-stars are:
<3, (0, 1, 4)>, 
<8, (0, 1, 2)>,
<9, (0, 1, 2)>.
