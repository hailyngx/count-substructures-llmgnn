Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star pattern.

The central node and its adjacent nodes form a 3-star. Let's list the 3-stars found in this graph:

<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<0, (4, 2, 6)>
<0, (6, 1, 4)>

<1, (0, 6, 2)>
<1, (6, 0, 4)>

<2, (0, 4, 6)>
<2, (4, 0, 6)>
<2, (6, 0, 9)>

<3, (5, 8, 9)>
<3, (8, 5, 9)>

<4, (0, 2, 6)>

<5, (3, 9, 2)>
<5, (9, 3, 6)>

<6, (0, 1, 2)>
<6, (1, 0, 4)>
<6, (2, 0, 4)>
<6, (4, 0, 2)>
<6, (0, 2, 6)>
<6, (2, 6, 9)>
<6, (4, 6, 1)>
<6, (6, 9, 2)>

<9, (2, 3, 5)>
<9, (3, 5, 6)>
