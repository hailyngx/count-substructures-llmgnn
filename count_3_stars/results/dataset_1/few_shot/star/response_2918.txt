Response:
First, let's identify the nodes which can act as the central node of a 3-star. These nodes must have exactly 3 neighbors.

Nodes that can be central nodes:
- Node 0 (neighbors: 1, 3, 6)
- Node 1 (neighbors: 0, 7, 8)
- Node 3 (neighbors: 0, 6, 8)
- Node 6 (neighbors: 0, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9)
- Node 7 (neighbors: 1, 4, 6, 9)

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph by going through each potential central node and checking if it forms a 3-star. 

For <0, (1, 3, 6)>:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 6.
- There is a 3-star centered at node 0.

For <1, (0, 7, 8)>:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 7, and 8.
- There is a 3-star centered at node 1.

For <3, (0, 6, 8)>:
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 6, and 8.
- There is a 3-star centered at node 3.

For <6, (0, 3, 5)>:
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 5.
- There is a 3-star centered at node 6.

For <6, (0, 7, 9)>:
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 7, and 9.
- There is a 3-star centered at node 6.

For <6, (3, 4, 7)>:
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 7.
- There is a 3-star centered at node 6.

For <6, (3, 4, 9)>:
