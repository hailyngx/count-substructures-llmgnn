Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 4) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 3

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star. 

Let's go through each node and its connections to find all possible 3-stars:

- From Node 0: No 3-stars as it has only one connection.
- From Node 1: <1, (4, 7, 8)> represents a 3-star.
- From Node 2: No 3-stars as it has only two connections.
- From Node 3: No 3-stars as it has only two connections.
- From Node 4: <4, (1, 6, 8)> represents a 3-star.
- From Node 5: No 3-stars as it has only one connection.
- From Node 6: No 3-stars as it has only one connection.
- From Node 7: No 3-stars as it has only one connection.
- From Node 8: <8, (1, 4, 5)> represents a 3-star.
- From Node 9: No 3-stars as it has only three connections.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2]. 
The unique 3-stars are: <1, (4, 7, 8)>, <4, (1, 6, 8)>, <8, (1, 4, 5)>.
