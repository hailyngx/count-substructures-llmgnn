Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern.

Based on the provided adjacency list and the definition of a 3-star graph, here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<1, (0, 3, 6)>
<4, (5, 6, 8)>
<5, (0, 4, 8)>
<6, (0, 1, 3)>
<7, (0, 1, 2)>
<8, (4, 5, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
