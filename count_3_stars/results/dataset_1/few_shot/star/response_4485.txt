Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 7

Response:
Starting from node 0:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 7, and 9. <0, (4, 7, 9)>
  
From node 1 to node 2:
- Node 1 does not form a 3-star.
- Node 2 does not form a 3-star.

From node 3 to node 4:
- Node 3 does not form a 3-star.
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 7, and 9. <4, (0, 7, 9)>

From node 5 to node 6:
- Node 5 does not form a 3-star.
- Node 6 does not form a 3-star.

From node 7 to node 8:
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 3, and 9. <7, (0, 3, 9)>
- Node 8 does not form a 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars is [2].
<0, (4, 7, 9)>
<4, (0, 7, 9)>
