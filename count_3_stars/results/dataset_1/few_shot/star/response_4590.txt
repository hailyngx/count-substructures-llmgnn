Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 8

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star by checking if a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star configuration. 

Let's identify the 3-stars step-by-step:
1. Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 9. Since 6 is connected to exactly three other nodes (1, 9, 3) in a star configuration, we have a 3-star centered at node 6. 

Thus, there is 1 unique 3-star in this graph: 
<6, (1, 9, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1].
