Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a 3-star pattern.

First, let's identify the nodes connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 0 is connected to 4 nodes (2, 5, 8, 9)
- Node 1 is connected to 4 nodes (4, 5, 8, 9)
- Node 4 is connected to 4 nodes (1, 2, 3, 8)
- Node 5 is connected to 4 nodes (0, 1, 4, 8)
- Node 8 is connected to 5 nodes (0, 1, 4, 5, 9)
- Node 9 is connected to 4 nodes (0, 1, 3, 8)

Now, we can identify the unique 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (2, 5, 8)>
<0, (2, 5, 9)>
<1, (4, 5, 8)>
<1, (4, 5, 9)>
<4, (1, 2, 8)>
<4, (1, 3, 8)>
<4, (2, 3, 8)>
<4, (2, 5, 8)>
<4, (3, 5, 8)>
<5, (0, 4, 8)>
<5, (0, 4, 1)>
<5, (0, 4, 5)>
<5, (1, 4, 8)>
<8, (0, 4, 5)>
<8, (0, 4, 9)>
<8, (1, 4, 5)>
<8, (1, 4, 9)>
<8, (4, 5, 9)>

Finally, counting the number of unique 3-stars, we get a total of [18].
