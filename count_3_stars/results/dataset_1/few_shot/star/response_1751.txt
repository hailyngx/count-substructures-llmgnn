Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 6) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 5

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify unique instances where a node is the central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Based on the provided information, the possible 3-stars in the graph are as follows:
<0, (2, 6, 7)>
<2, (0, 1, 8)>
<5, (6, 8, 9)>

Therefore, there are [3] 3-stars in the given graph.
