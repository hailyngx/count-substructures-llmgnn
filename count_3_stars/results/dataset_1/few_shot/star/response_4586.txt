Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 7

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (2, 3, 8)>
<2, (1, 3, 6)>
<3, (1, 2, 8)>
<5, (6, 7, 8)>
<6, (2, 5, 7)>
<7, (5, 6, 8)>
