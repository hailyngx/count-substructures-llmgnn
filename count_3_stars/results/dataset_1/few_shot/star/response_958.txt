Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star in the graph. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Looking at the adjacency list and the provided edges, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (2, 5, 6)>
<2, (0, 1, 5)>
<4, (7, 8, 9)>
<8, (3, 4, 5)>
<9, (0, 1, 4)>

Count of 3-stars: [5]
