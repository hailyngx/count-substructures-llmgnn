Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 1) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 5, and node 8

Response:
I will guide you through identifying the 3-stars in the given graph step by step. 

Step 1: Identify the central node of each potential 3-star.
- Look for nodes with exactly three edges connected to them.

Based on the adjacency list:
- Node 1 has 3 edges (to nodes 2, 4, 5).
- Node 2 has 4 edges (to nodes 1, 6, 7, 8).

So, we have two potential central nodes: 1 and 2.

Step 2: For each potential central node, check if the connected nodes form a 3-star.
- A 3-star is formed when the central node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Checking for node 1:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 5, forming a 3-star: <1, (2, 4, 5)>

Checking for node 2:
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 6, and 7. This does not form a 3-star since it has 4 connections.

Therefore, the only 3-star in the given graph is <1, (2, 4, 5)>.

Count of 3-stars: [1]
