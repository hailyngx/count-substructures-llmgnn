Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we can see the connections for each node. Let's identify the 3-stars:

1. <1, (2, 4, 7)>
2. <1, (2, 7, 9)>
3. <1, (4, 7, 9)>
4. <7, (1, 4, 5)>

There are a total of [4] 3-stars in the given graph.
