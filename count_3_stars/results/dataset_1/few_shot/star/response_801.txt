Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 4
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 1

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph step by step:

1. Node 0 forms 1 3-star: <0, (2, 9)>
2. Node 1 forms 2 3-stars: <1, (2, 7, 9)> and <1, (2, 7, 9)>
3. Node 2 forms 3 3-stars: <2, (0, 1, 9)>, <2, (1, 3, 7)>, and <2, (1, 5, 7)>
4. Node 3 forms 1 3-star: <3, (2, 4, 6)>
5. Node 4 forms 1 3-star: <4, (3, 7, 7)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we have a total of [6] 3-stars.
