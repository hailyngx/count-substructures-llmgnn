Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's identify the 3-stars step by step:

1. Find nodes with exactly three neighbors:
   - Node 0, Node 1, Node 3, Node 6, and Node 7 have less than 3 neighbors.
   - Node 2 has 5 neighbors.
   - Node 4 has 4 neighbors.
   - Node 5 and Node 8 have 7 neighbors.
   - Node 9 has 4 neighbors.

2. Identify the 3-stars:
   - From the adjacency list, we find that Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 5, and 8 forming a 3-star. <2, (0, 5, 8)>
   - Similarly, Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 9 forming another 3-star. <8, (1, 5, 9)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
