Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 5
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three nodes, forming a 3-star pattern. Here are the steps to find and count the 3-stars:

1. Identify nodes with exactly three neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 2, 4, 5
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors, not a 3-star
- Node 1 has 0 neighbors, not a 3-star
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 2, 7, 9
- Node 5 has 1 neighbor, not a 3-star
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors, not a 3-star

2. Check each valid node to see if they form a 3-star:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 4, 5: <0, (2, 4, 5)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 7, 9: <3, (2, 7, 9)>

Count of 3-stars: [2]
Unique 3-stars: <0, (2, 4, 5)>, <3, (2, 7, 9)>
