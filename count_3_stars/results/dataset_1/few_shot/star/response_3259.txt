Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 4, 7, and node 8

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that form a 3-star. Since a 3-star consists of a center node connected to three other nodes, we need to find nodes in the graph that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

From the adjacency list:
- Node 0 is connected to 2 nodes
- Node 1 is connected to 4 nodes
- Node 2 is connected to 1 node
- Node 3 is connected to 2 nodes
- Node 4 is connected to 1 node
- Node 5 is connected to 2 nodes
- Node 6 is connected to 3 nodes
- Node 7 is connected to 3 nodes
- Node 8 is connected to 4 nodes
- Node 9 is connected to 4 nodes

Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9 are each connected to exactly three other nodes and can potentially be center nodes of a 3-star graph.

Let's check each potential center node and identify the 3-stars:
- For Node 6: (6, 1, 5), (6, 1, 7)
- For Node 7: (7, 1, 9), (7, 1, 8)
- For Node 8: (8, 9, 3), (8, 9, 7)
- For Node 9: (9, 1, 4), (9, 1, 7), (9, 1, 8)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8] <6, (1, 5, 6), (1, 7, 6), 7, (1, 8, 7), (1, 9, 7), 8, (9, 3, 8), (9, 7, 8), (1, 4, 9), (1, 7, 9), (1, 8, 9)>
