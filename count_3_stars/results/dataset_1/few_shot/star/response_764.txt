Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify unique 3-stars.

By definition, a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Since the graph has 10 nodes in total, we will check each node to see if it is at the center of a 3-star.

Let's go through each node:
1. Node 0: <0, (2, 5, 7)>
2. Node 1: Not a center of any 3-star.
3. Node 2: Not a center of any 3-star.
4. Node 3: <3, (5, 9, 6)>
5. Node 4: Not a center of any 3-star.
6. Node 5: <5, (0, 3, 6)> and <5, (0, 6, 8)> and <5, (3, 6, 9)>
7. Node 6: Not a center of any 3-star.
8. Node 7: <7, (0, 8, 9)>
9. Node 8: Not a center of any 3-star.
10. Node 9: <9, (0, 6, 7)> and <9, (3, 5, 6)> and <9, (5, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 5, 7)>, <3, (5, 9, 6)>, <5, (0, 3, 6)>, <5, (0, 6, 8)>, <5, (3, 6, 9)>, <7, (0, 8, 9)>, <9, (0, 6, 7)>, <9, (3, 5, 6)>, <9, (5, 7, 9)>

Count of 3-stars: [9]
