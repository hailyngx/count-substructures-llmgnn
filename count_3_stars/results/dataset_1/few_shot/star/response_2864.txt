Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node and its connected nodes for each 3-star configuration. 

Let's go through each node and its connections to find all 3-stars:
1. Node 0: <0, (1, 7, 9)>
2. Node 1: <1, (0, 2, 3)>
3. Node 3: <3, (1, 6, 9)>
4. Node 7: <7, (0, 5, 8)>
5. Node 9: <9, (0, 3, 6)>

Thus, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].

<List of 3-stars: <0, (1, 7, 9)> <1, (0, 2, 3)> <3, (1, 6, 9)> <7, (0, 5, 8)> <9, (0, 3, 6)>]
