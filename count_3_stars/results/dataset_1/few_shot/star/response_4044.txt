Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 7

Response:
First, let's identify the central node of each potential 3-star in the graph. 
Looking at the adjacency list, we can see that Node 0, Node 7, and Node 9 are the only nodes connected to exactly 3 other nodes.

Now, let's find all the 3-stars in the graph:
- For Node 0: (0, 7, 9)
- For Node 7: (7, 0, 9), (7, 3, 4), (7, 3, 5), (7, 4, 2), (7, 5, 2), (7, 4, 3)
- For Node 9: (9, 0, 2), (9, 0, 7), (9, 2, 0)

Counting all unique 3-stars, we have:
[ <0, (7, 9, 0)>, <7, (0, 9, 7), (3, 5, 7), (3, 4, 7), (4, 2, 7)>, <9, (0, 7, 9), (0, 2, 9)> ] 
[ 7 ]
