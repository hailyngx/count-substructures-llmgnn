Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 4

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

1. Node 0 forms a 3-star: <0, (6, 9)>
2. Node 2 forms a 3-star: <2, (3, 6)>
3. Node 3 forms a 3-star: <3, (2, 4, 7)>
4. Node 4 forms a 3-star: <4, (3, 6, 9)>
5. Node 7 forms a 3-star: <7, (3, 5)>
6. Node 9 forms a 3-star: <9, (0, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
