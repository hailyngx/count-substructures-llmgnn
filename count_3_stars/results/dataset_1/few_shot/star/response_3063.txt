Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph.
Since a 3-star consists of a center node and 3 other nodes connected to the center node, we need to find all such configurations in the given graph.

Let's list the 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<1, (5, 4, 9)>
<9, (1, 3, 8)> 

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph.
