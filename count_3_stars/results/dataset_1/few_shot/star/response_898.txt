Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to understand that a 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's analyze the given graph and list all the 3-stars:

- In a 3-star, the central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Therefore, nodes with 3 connections will be the central nodes of the 3-stars. From the adjacency list, we find that nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 have 3 connections each, which means they can be central nodes.

Therefore, the possible central nodes for 3-stars are: {0, 1, 2, 3}.

- Now, let's find the leaves connected to each central node:

1. Central node 0: Leaves connected to 0 are nodes {1, 2, 3}
   <0, (1, 2, 3)>

2. Central node 1: Leaves connected to 1 are nodes {0, 2, 3, 9}
   <1, (0, 2, 3)>
   <1, (2, 0, 3)>

3. Central node 2: Leaves connected to 2 are nodes {0, 1, 3, 6}
   <2, (0, 1, 3)>
   <2, (1, 0, 3)>

4. Central node 3: Leaves connected to 3 are nodes {0, 1, 2, 5}
   <3, (0, 1, 2)>
   <3, (1, 0, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
