Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 6, and node 8
