Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 4

Response:
First, let's identify which nodes can be considered as the center of a 3-star graph. For a node to be the center of a 3-star, it must have exactly three neighbors. The nodes that satisfy this condition in the given graph are nodes 0, 6, and 8.

For each of these candidate center nodes, we will check if they form a 3-star:

1. Node 0:
   Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, 7, and 9.
   Node 2, 3, and 4 form a 3-star centered at 0: <0, (2, 3, 4)>
   Node 9 does not form a 3-star with node 0.

2. Node 6:
   Node 6 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 8.
   Nodes 3, 4, and 8 form a 3-star centered at 6: <6, (3, 4, 8)>

3. Node 8:
   Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 6, and 7.
   Nodes 2, 3, and 6 form a 3-star centered at 8: <8, (2, 3, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<6, (3, 4, 8)>
<8, (2, 3, 6)>
