Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 8

Response:
First, we identify the 3-star patterns in the graph. A 3-star pattern consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

From the given adjacency list, we can see the following 3-stars:
<0, (4, 6, 7)>
<1, (6, 8, _)>
<2, (6, 9, _)>
<3, (4, 5, 7)>
<4, (0, 3, 8)>
<5, (3, 9, _)>
<6, (0, 1, _)>
<7, (0, 3, 8)>
<8, (1, 3, 4)>
<9, (2, 4, 8)>

Counting the unique 3-stars found, we get a total of [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
