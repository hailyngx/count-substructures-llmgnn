Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 6

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph. First, we can list all the nodes and their connections:

Node 0: 2
Node 1: 4, 5, 7, 9
Node 2: 0, 8
Node 3: 4, 7
Node 4: 1, 3, 5, 9
Node 5: 1, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9
Node 6: 5, 9
Node 7: 1, 3, 5
Node 8: 2, 5
Node 9: 1, 4, 5, 6

Next, we can identify the 3-stars in the given graph and count the total number of 3-stars.

The unique 3-stars in the graph are:
<1, (4, 5, 9)>
<4, (1, 5, 9)>
<5, (1, 4, 9)>
<9, (1, 4, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
