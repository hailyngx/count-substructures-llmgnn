Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 4) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 1

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 5, and an additional node that is not connected directly to node 0.
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 6, and 9.
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 4, and an additional node that is not connected directly to node 2.
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 7, and 8.
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 6, and an additional node that is not connected directly to node 5.
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 5, and an additional node that is not connected directly to node 6.

So the unique 3-stars in the graph are:
<0, (2, 5, 7)>
<1, (3, 6, 9)>
<2, (0, 4, 8)>
<4, (2, 7, 8)>
<5, (0, 6, 1)>
<6, (1, 5, 0)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
