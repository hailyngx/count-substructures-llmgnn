Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will be the centers of 3-stars.

Now let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
1. Center: Node 2, Leaves: Node 0, Node 1, Node 4 <2, (0, 1, 4)>
2. Center: Node 4, Leaves: Node 0, Node 1, Node 2 <4, (0, 1, 2)>
3. Center: Node 4, Leaves: Node 5, Node 6, Node 8 <4, (5, 6, 8)>

Count of 3-stars: [3]
