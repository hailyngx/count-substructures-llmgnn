Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 4

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are:
<1, (2, 6, 7)>
<2, (1, 6, 7)>
<3, (4, 5, 9)>
<4, (3, 8, 9)>
<5, (3, 6, 5)>
<6, (2, 5, 6)>
<7, (1, 8, 7)>
<8, (4, 7, 9)>
<9, (4, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
