Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 1

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern with the central node and three leaves.

In this graph, we can see the following 3-stars:
<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<0, (1, 5, 9)>
<0, (3, 5, 9)>
<2, (4, 5, 6)>
<5, (4, 6, 8)>
<6, (3, 4, 8)>
