Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each possible 3-star configuration.

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph: 
<0, (6, 8, 1)>
<1, (6, 7, 0)>
<2, (3, 7, 9)>
<3, (2, 4, 5)>
<4, (3, 5, 6)>
<6, (0, 8, 7)>
<7, (1, 2, 4)>
<8, (0, 6, 3)>
<9, (2, 7, 3)>

Counting these unique 3-stars, we find a total of [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
