Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Let's identify each unique 3-star pattern:

<0, (3, 6, 7)>
<1, (3, 4, 7)>
<2, (4, 6, 7)>
<3, (0, 1, 8)>
<4, (1, 2, 5)>
<5, (4, 8, 9)>
<6, (0, 4, 9)>
<7, (1, 8, 9)>

Now, counting the number of unique 3-stars found, we get: [8].
