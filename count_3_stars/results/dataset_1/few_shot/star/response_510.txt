Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 5, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will serve as the centers of the 3-stars. Let's identify these 3-stars step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to 2, 5, and 8:
   <0, (2, 5, 8)>

2. Node 5 is connected to 0, 1, 8, and 9:
   <5, (0, 1, 8)>
   <5, (0, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3]. 
The unique 3-stars identified are: <0, (2, 5, 8)>, <5, (0, 1, 8)>, and <5, (0, 8, 9)>.
