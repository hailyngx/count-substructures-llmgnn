Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 7) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 7
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 5

Response:
There are a total of [4] 3-stars in this graph.

Unique 3-stars: 
<1, (0, 4, 5)>
<1, (9, 4, 5)>
<5, (1, 8, 9)>
<9, (1, 4, 5)>
