Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star by locating a central node that is connected to exactly three other nodes.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (3, 9, 3)>
<1, (2, 4, 8)>
<4, (1, 2, 9)>
<7, (3, 4, 5)>
<8, (1, 2, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
