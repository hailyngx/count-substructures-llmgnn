Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 5

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

In a 3-star, the center node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through each node and its neighbors to find all the 3-stars:

- Node 0 is not a center of any 3-star.
- Node 1 is not a center of any 3-star.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 7. So, the 3-star with center at node 2 is <2, (3, 4, 7)>.
- Node 3 is not a center of any 3-star.
- Node 4 is not a center of any 3-star.
- Node 5 is not a center of any 3-star.
- Node 6 is not a center of any 3-star.
- Node 7 is not a center of any 3-star.
- Node 8 is not a center of any 3-star.
- Node 9 is not a center of any 3-star.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1].

The unique 3-star found:
<2, (3, 4, 7)>
