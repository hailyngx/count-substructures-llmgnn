Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all occurrences of 3-stars. 

Let's start by listing all the 3-stars found in the graph:

<1, (5, 7, 8)>
<1, (7, 5, 8)>
<7, (1, 5, 8)>
<7, (5, 1, 8)>
<8, (1, 5, 7)>
<8, (5, 1, 7)>

Looking at the list above, we can see that there are a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
