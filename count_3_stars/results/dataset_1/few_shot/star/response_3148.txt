Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through each node and find the 3-stars:

1. Node 0 is not part of any 3-star.
2. Node 1 is part of a 3-star: <1, (5, 6, 9)>
3. Node 2 is not part of any 3-star.
4. Node 3 is part of a 3-star: <3, (2, 9, 4)>
5. Node 4 is part of a 3-star: <4, (7, 8, 9)>
6. Node 5 is not part of any 3-star.
7. Node 6 is not part of any 3-star.
8. Node 7 is part of a 3-star: <7, (4, 9, 1)>
9. Node 8 is not part of any 3-star.
10. Node 9 is part of three 3-stars: 
   - <9, (0, 1, 3)>
   - <9, (4, 5, 7)>
   - <9, (1, 3, 4)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].  
The unique 3-stars found are: 
<1, (5, 6, 9)>, 
<3, (2, 9, 4)>, 
<4, (7, 8, 9)>, 
<7, (4, 9, 1)>, 
<9, (0, 1, 3)>, 
<9, (4, 5, 7)>, 
<9, (1, 3, 4)>.
