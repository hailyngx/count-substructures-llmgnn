Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 6
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 4

Response:
Given the graph information, we need to find all the 3-stars in the graph. Let's start by identifying each 3-star present in the graph.

There are three 3-stars in this graph, which are:
1. <0, (4, 6, 7)>
2. <1, (2, 4, 7)>
3. <4, (0, 1, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
