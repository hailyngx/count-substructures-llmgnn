Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 6
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern.

We can start by examining each node and its neighbors to identify any 3-stars:

1. Node 0: Not a part of any 3-star.
2. Node 1: <1, (0, 7, 8)>
3. Node 2: <2, (4, 6, 7)>
4. Node 3: Not a part of any 3-star.
5. Node 4: <4, (2, 6, 6)>
6. Node 5: Not a part of any 3-star.
7. Node 6: <6, (2, 4, 5)>
8. Node 7: Not a part of any 3-star.
9. Node 8: <8, (1, 3, 6)>
10. Node 9: Not a part of any 3-star.

Count of 3-stars: [4]

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the graph are:
<1, (0, 7, 8)>
<2, (4, 6, 7)>
<4, (2, 6, 6)>
<6, (2, 4, 5)>
