Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 1

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star pattern. 

Looking at the adjacency list provided, we can see that nodes 0, 1, 6, and 7 meet this criteria. Let's list the 3-stars:

[4]
<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<1, (0, 2, 6)>
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<3, (2, 7)>
<5, (0, 6, 7)>
<6, (0, 1, 2)>
<7, (1, 3, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is: [7].
