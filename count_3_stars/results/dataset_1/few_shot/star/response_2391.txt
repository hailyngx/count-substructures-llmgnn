Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 5

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph:

<1, (2, 8, 9)>
<2, (1, 3, 4)>
<4, (0, 2, 3)>
<5, (4, 6, 7)>
<8, (1, 4, 7)>
<9, (1, 5, -)>

Count the number of 3-stars in the graph: [6].
