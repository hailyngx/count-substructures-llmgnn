Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars. 

Looking at the adjacency list for each node, we can see that every node is connected to at least three other nodes. This implies that every node, except the center of a 3-star, can be the center of at most one 3-star.

Let's list out the unique 3-stars from the graph:
<0, (3, 4, 6)>
<0, (3, 4, 7)>
<0, (3, 6, 9)>
<2, (4, 5, 7)>
<2, (4, 5, 9)>
<5, (2, 7, 9)>
<6, (0, 1, 9)>
<7, (0, 4, 9)>
<8, (0, 2, 9)> 

Count the number of unique 3-stars found.
