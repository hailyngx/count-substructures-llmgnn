Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 1

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star-like pattern.

Examining the graph and adjacency list, we can see that there are several 3-stars present. Let's list them:
<0, (3, 5, 2)>
<2, (5, 6, 7)>
<2, (5, 6, 8)>
<2, (5, 7, 8)>
<3, (0, 5, 2)>
<5, (0, 2, 3)>
<5, (2, 3, 6)>
<6, (2, 4, 5)>
<7, (2, 4, 8)>
<8, (2, 4, 7)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we get a total of [9].
