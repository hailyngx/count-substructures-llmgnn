Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 8

Response:
To identify the 3-stars in the given graph, we look for nodes that are connected to exactly 3 other nodes. Let's list the 3-stars found in the graph:

<2, (5, 7, 9)>
<3, (1, 7, 9)>
<8, (0, 4, 9)>
<9, (2, 3, 8)>
