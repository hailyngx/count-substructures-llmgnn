Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8)

Response:
The center node of a 3-star graph is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph step by step.

1. Node 0 is not part of any 3-star as it is only connected to 2 nodes.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0 and 7. However, it does not form a 3-star as it requires one more connection to be a center node.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 7, 8, and 9. This node forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 7, and 8. <
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 4 and 5. It does not form a 3-star.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 5, 7, and 9. This node forms two 3-stars: <2, (4, 7, 8)> and <8, (4, 7, 9)>.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 6. It does not form a 3-star.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 5, 7, and 8. It does not form a 3-star.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, 6, and 9. This node forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 4, and 9. <
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 6, and 9. It does not form a 3-star.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 7, and 8. This node forms two 3-stars: <7, (4, 1, 9)> and <4, (2, 7, 8)>.

Therefore, the number of unique 3-stars in the given graph is [4]. The unique 3-stars are <2, (4, 7, 8)>, <8, (4, 7, 9)>, <1, (4, 7, 9)>, and <4, (2, 7, 8)>.
