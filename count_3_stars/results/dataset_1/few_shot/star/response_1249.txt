Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 2) (7, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 9
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the central nodes of each potential 3-star. Since a 3-star consists of a center connected to exactly three other nodes, we will look for nodes connected to exactly three other nodes.

Observing the adjacency list for each node:
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 5, 6, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 7.

From the above information, we can see that both nodes 2 and 9 are connected to exactly three other nodes, making them potential central nodes of 3-stars.

Next, we identify the leaves (nodes connected to the central node) for each potential central node:
For node 2: Nodes 1, 3, 5, and 6 are connected to node 2.
For node 9: Nodes 4 and 7 are connected to node 9.

Now, we can list the unique 3-stars found:
<2, (1, 3, 5)>
<2, (1, 3, 6)>
<2, (1, 5, 6)>
<2, (3, 5, 6)>
<9, (4, 7, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
