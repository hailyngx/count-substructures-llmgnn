Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and node 8

Response:
Based on the given information, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph by finding instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's examine each node as a potential center of a 3-star:

- Node 0: <0, (1, 3, 6)>
- Node 1: <1, (0, 7, 9)>
- Node 2: <2, (7, 9, 0)>
- Node 3: This node is not part of any 3-star.
- Node 4: This node is not part of any 3-star.
- Node 5: This node is not part of any 3-star.
- Node 6: <6, (0, 9, 1)>
- Node 7: <7, (1, 2, 4)>
- Node 8: This node is not part of any 3-star.
- Node 9: This node is not part of any 3-star.

Therefore, based on the connections in the graph, the 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 3, 6)>, <1, (0, 7, 9)>, <2, (7, 9, 0)>, <6, (0, 9, 1)>, and <7, (1, 2, 4)>.

Count of 3-stars: [5]
