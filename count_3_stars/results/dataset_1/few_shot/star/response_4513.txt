Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-star configurations. 

By definition, a 3-star has a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list the unique 3-star configurations based on the given information:

<0, (1, 2, 6)>
<1, (0, 8, 9)>
<2, (0, 4, 7)>
<4, (2, 3, 7)>
<9, (1, 5, 6)>

There are a total of 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
