Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 4

Response:
Alright, let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Three stars centered at Node 2: <2, (1, 7, 9)>, <2, (6, 7, 8)>
2. Three stars centered at Node 5: <5, (1, 4, 7)>
3. Three stars centered at Node 7: <7, (1, 2, 5)>, <7, (1, 3, 5)>, <7, (2, 3, 5)>
4. Three stars centered at Node 9: <9, (0, 2, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
