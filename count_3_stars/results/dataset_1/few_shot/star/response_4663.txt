Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 8

Response:
