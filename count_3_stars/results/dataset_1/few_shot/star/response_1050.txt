Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 6, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's go through each node and identify the 3-stars:

For node 0:
- Node 0 is not part of any 3-star.

For node 1:
- <1, (2, 4, 6)>
- <1, (2, 6, 9)>
- <1, (4, 6, 9)>

For node 2:
- Node 2 is not part of any 3-star.

For node 3:
- <3, (0, 4, 5)>
- <3, (0, 4, 7)>
- <3, (0, 5, 7)>

For node 4:
- Node 4 is not part of any 3-star.

For node 5:
- Node 5 is not part of any 3-star.

For node 6:
- <6, (1, 7, 8)>
- <6, (1, 8, 9)>
- <6, (7, 8, 9)>

For node 7:
- <7, (3, 6, 9)>
- <7, (6, 8, 9)>

For node 8:
- Node 8 is not part of any 3-star.

For node 9:
- Node 9 is not part of any 3-star.

Count of 3-stars: [12]
Unique 3-stars: <<1, (2, 4, 6)>, <1, (2, 6, 9)>, <1, (4, 6, 9)>, <3, (0, 4, 5)>, <3, (0, 4, 7)>, <3, (0, 5, 7)>, <6, (1, 7, 8)>, <6, (1, 8, 9)>, <6, (7, 8, 9)>, <7, (3, 6, 9)>, <7, (6, 8, 9)>]
