Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 3

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the 3-stars present in the graph. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's analyze the graph and identify the 3-stars:
1. For Node 0: (0, 4, 8, 9) - This forms a 3-star with central node 0 and leaves 4, 8, and 9.
2. For Node 4: (4, 0, 5, 7), (4, 0, 8), (4, 7) - These form 3-stars with central node 4 and leaves 0, 5, 7, and 8.
3. For Node 8: (8, 0, 3, 4) - This forms a 3-star with central node 8 and leaves 0, 3, and 4.
4. For Node 9: (9, 0, 3) - This forms a 3-star with central node 9 and leaves 0 and 3.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (4, 8, 9)>
<4, (0, 5, 7)>
<4, (0, 8)>
<4, (7)>
<8, (0, 3, 4)>
<9, (0, 3)>
