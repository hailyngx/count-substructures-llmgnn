Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 3

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a 3-star.

From the adjacency list provided:
- Node 6 is connected to node 0, 4, and 5 forming a 3-star with 6 as the central node: <6, (0, 4, 5)>
- Node 2 is connected to node 1, 7, and 8 forming a 3-star with 2 as the central node: <2, (1, 7, 8)>

There are a total of 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph, so the final answer is [2].
