Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the 3-stars by finding all instances where a node has exactly three neighbors forming a 3-star configuration.

Let's list the unique 3-stars from the graph:

<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<3, (2, 7, 8)>
<5, (0, 2, 6)>
<8, (1, 3, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
