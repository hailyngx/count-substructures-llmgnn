Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 4
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 4, and 5. <0, (2, 4, 5)>
2. Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 4, and 8. <2, (0, 4, 8)>
3. Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 4, and 8. <3, (0, 4, 8)>
4. Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 3, and 8. <4, (0, 3, 8)>
5. Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 2, and 7. <5, (0, 2, 7)>

Therefore, there are a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
