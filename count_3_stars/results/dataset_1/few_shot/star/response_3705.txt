Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the nodes that are part of a 3-star pattern. Remember, a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

In this graph, the 3-stars can be identified based on the nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them. Let's list them below:

<0, (6, 7, 8)>
<7, (0, 1, 9)>
<9, (0, 3, 7)>
<4, (1, 3, 6)>

Therefore, there are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.
