Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 6

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (1, 7, 9)>
<1, (0, 2, 4)>
<2, (1, 5, 6)>
<3, (7, 9, 6)>
<4, (1, 6, 7)>
<5, (1, 2, 0)>
<6, (2, 4, 9)>
<7, (0, 3, 4)>
<8, (7)>
<9, (0, 3, 6)>
