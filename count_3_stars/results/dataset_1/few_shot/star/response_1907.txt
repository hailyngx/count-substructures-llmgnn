Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 5) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph can be identified by looking at nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list them:

<0, (4, 9)>
<1, (6, 7)>
<6, (1, 7, 8)>
<7, (1, 6)>
<8, (5, 6)>

Counting the unique 3-stars found, the final answer is [5].
