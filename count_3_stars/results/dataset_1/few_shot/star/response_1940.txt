Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star configuration.

Here are the 3-stars found in the graph:

[6]

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [1].
