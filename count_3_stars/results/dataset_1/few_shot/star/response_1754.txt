Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 6

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify all the unique instances where a node has exactly three neighbors connected by edges. We can do this by examining each node and checking if it forms a 3-star configuration.

Let's go through each node:

- Node 0: Forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 7, and 8. <0, (3, 7, 8)>
- Node 1: Does not form a 3-star as it has only 2 neighbors.
- Node 2: Does not form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- Node 3: Forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 4, and 6. <3, (0, 4, 6)>
- Node 4: Does not form a 3-star as it has only 2 neighbors.
- Node 5: Does not form a 3-star as it has only 2 neighbors.
- Node 6: Forms two 3-stars: <6, (1, 3, 5)> and <6, (0, 3, 9)>
- Node 7: Forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 8, and 1. <7, (0, 8, 1)>
- Node 8: Forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, and 7. <8, (1, 3, 7)>
- Node 9: Does not form a 3-star as it has only 2 neighbors.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (3, 7, 8)>
<3, (0, 4, 6)>
<6, (1, 3, 5)>
<6, (0, 3, 9)>
<7, (0, 8, 1)>
