Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 9
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we can look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges, with one of those connections being with the center node. However, when observing the adjacency list and the edges provided, we can see that some nodes have more than three connections. We need to identify the 3-stars that exist in the graph. 

Let's start by listing the 3-stars we can find in the graph:

<0, (2, 3, 5)>
<0, (2, 5, 7)>
<0, (3, 5, 7)>
<0, (5, 7, 8)>
<4, (2, 3, 7)>
<4, (2, 5, 7)>
<4, (3, 5, 7)>
<4, (5, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
