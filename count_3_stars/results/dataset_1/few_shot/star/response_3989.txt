Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are as follows:
<[0, (1, 6, 8)]> 
<[1, (0, 6, 7)]> 
<[8, (0, 3, 4)]> 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
