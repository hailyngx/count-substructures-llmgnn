Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 9
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star, which consists of a center node and three connected nodes.

Looking at the adjacency list, we can see that there are some occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. These instances represent possible 3-stars. Let's list them below:

<1, (4, 5, 7)>
<4, (0, 1, 2)>
<7, (1, 3, 9)>
<9, (0, 7)>

Therefore, there are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.
