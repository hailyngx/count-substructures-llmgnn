Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 5, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Based on the given information, the nodes in the graph with their connections are:

Node 0: {2, 4, 6, 7}
Node 1: {4, 8}
Node 2: {0, 4}
Node 3: {5, 6}
Node 4: {0, 1, 2, 8}
Node 5: {3, 9}
Node 6: {0, 3}
Node 7: {0}
Node 8: {1, 4, 9}
Node 9: {5, 8}

Let's identify the unique 3-stars:

<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<0, (2, 4, 7)>
<0, (4, 6, 7)>
<4, (1, 8, 2)>
<4, (1, 8, 9)>

Counting the unique 3-stars found:
