Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can identify all possible 3-stars by considering each node as the center node, and then checking if it is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Analyzing each node:
- Node 0: <0, (2, 3, 4)>
- Node 1: <1, (2, 4, 7)>
- Node 2: <2, (0, 1, 3)>
- Node 3: <3, (0, 2, 8)>
- Node 4: <4, (0, 1, 7)>
- Node 5: None (connected to 3 nodes but not in a 3-star configuration)
- Node 6: None (connected to 2 nodes)
- Node 7: <7, (1, 4, 5)> and <7, (4, 5, 6)>
- Node 8: <8, (3, 5, 6)>

Count of 3-stars in the graph: [6]
Unique 3-stars: <0, (2, 3, 4)>, <1, (2, 4, 7)>, <2, (0, 1, 3)>, <3, (0, 2, 8)>, <4, (0, 1, 7)>, <7, (1, 4, 5)>
