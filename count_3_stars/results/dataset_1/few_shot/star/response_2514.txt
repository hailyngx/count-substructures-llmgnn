Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through each node and identify the 3-stars:

- Node 0: No 3-star here since it has only 2 neighbors.
- Node 1: <1, (2, 4, 5)> (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5)
- Node 2: No 3-star here since it has only 2 neighbors.
- Node 3: No 3-star here since it has more than 3 neighbors.
- Node 4: <4, (1, 5, 8)> (4, 1), (4, 5), (4, 8)
- Node 5: No 3-star here since it has only 2 neighbors.
- Node 6: No 3-star here since it has more than 3 neighbors.
- Node 7: No 3-star here since it has only 1 neighbor.
- Node 8: No 3-star here since it has more than 3 neighbors.
- Node 9: No 3-star here since it has no neighbors.

Count of 3-stars: [2]
Unique 3-stars: <1, (2, 4, 5)>, <4, (1, 5, 8)>
