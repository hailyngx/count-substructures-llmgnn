Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 3
