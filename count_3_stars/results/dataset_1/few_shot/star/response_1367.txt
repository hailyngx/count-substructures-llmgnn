Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to find all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's determine the unique 3-stars in this graph:

<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<1, (0, 6, 8)>
<2, (3, 4, 8)>
<3, (2, 7, 9)>
<4, (2, 6, 8)>
<6, (1, 4, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
