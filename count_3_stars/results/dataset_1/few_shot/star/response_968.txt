Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Looking at the adjacency list, we can identify the central nodes and their corresponding leaves. 

Here are the unique 3-stars in the graph:
<1, (4, 7, 9)>
<2, (4, 6, 8)>
<4, (1, 2, 7)>
<5, (7, 8, 9)>

Count of 3-stars: [4]
