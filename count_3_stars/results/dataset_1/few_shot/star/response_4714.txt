Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we can see that the nodes 1, 2, 7, and 8 are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes can act as the center of a 3-star graph. Let's determine the 3-stars for each of these potential centers:

1. For Node 1:
   - Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 9.
   - Thus, <1, (3, 4, 9)> is a 3-star.

2. For Node 2:
   - Node 2 is connected to nodes 6 and 9.
   - Thus, <2, (6, 9)> is a 3-star.

3. For Node 7:
   - Node 7 is connected to nodes 3 and 9.
   - Thus, <7, (3, 9)> is a 3-star.

4. For Node 8:
   - Node 8 is connected to nodes 5 and 9.
   - Thus, <8, (5, 9)> is a 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: <1, (3, 4, 9)>, <2, (6, 9)>, <7, (3, 9)>, <8, (5, 9)>.
