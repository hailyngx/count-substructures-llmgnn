Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the central node and its three adjacent nodes for each potential 3-star.

Let's identify the 3-stars:

1. Node 0: <0, (2, 3, 7)>
2. Node 1: <1, (4, 5, 8)>
3. Node 3: <3, (0, 6, 8)>
4. Node 5: <5, (1, 4, 7)>
5. Node 7: <7, (0, 5, 9)>
6. Node 9: <9, (0, 5, 7)>

Count of 3-stars: [6]
