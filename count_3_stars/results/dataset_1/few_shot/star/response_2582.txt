Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step-by-step:

First, let's identify the nodes that will act as the center of the 3-star. We'll look for nodes that have exactly three neighbors.

From the adjacency list:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 1 neighbor
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors
- Node 8 has 0 neighbors
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors

Nodes 1, 2, 4, and 7 have exactly 3 neighbors and can potentially act as centers of 3-stars.

Next, we need to check the neighbors of each potential center to see if they form 3-stars. We'll consider all unique combinations of three neighbors for each potential center.

For Node 1:
- Node 1, (0, 2, 3)
- Node 1, (2, 3, 7)

For Node 2:
- Node 2, (1, 4, 6)

For Node 4:
- Node 4, (2, 3, 5)

For Node 7:
- Node 7, (0, 3, 9)

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in the given graph are:
<1, (0, 2, 3)>, <1, (2, 3, 7)>, <2, (1, 4, 6)>, <4, (2, 3, 5)>, <7, (0, 3, 9)>.

Finally, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph, which is the total count of unique 3-stars found:
[5].
