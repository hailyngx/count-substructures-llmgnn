Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7

Response:
The central nodes of the 3-stars in the given graph will be the nodes with exactly three neighbors. Let's find those nodes: 

Central Nodes: 1, 4, 7

Now, let's find the leaves connected to each central node:

For central node 1: Leaves are 4, 7, and 9
For central node 4: Leaves are 1, 3, and 5
For central node 7: Leaves are 1, 3, and 9

Hence, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are:
<1, (4, 7, 9)>
<4, (1, 3, 5)>
<7, (1, 3, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
