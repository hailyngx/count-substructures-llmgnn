Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 9) (7, 2) (8, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the 3-stars. 
Here are the 3-stars found in the given graph with the central node listed first:

<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<3, (0, 1, 4)>
