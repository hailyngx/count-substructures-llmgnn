Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 2

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through each node's connections to find the 3-stars:

- Node 0: (2, 8, 9)
- Node 1: (2, 7, 9)
- Node 2: (0, 1, 9), (0, 7, 8), (1, 4, 6)
- Node 3: No 3-stars as it is connected to only 2 other nodes.
- Node 4: No 3-stars as it is connected to only 1 other node.
- Node 5: No 3-stars as it is connected to only 1 other node.
- Node 6: (2, 3, 8)
- Node 7: No 3-stars as it is connected to only 2 other nodes.
- Node 8: (0, 2, 7), (3, 6, 8)
- Node 9: (0, 1, 2)

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (2, 8, 9)>
<1, (2, 7, 9)>
<2, (0, 1, 9)>
<2, (0, 7, 8)>
<2, (1, 4, 6)>
<6, (2, 3, 8)>
<8, (0, 2, 7)>
<8, (3, 6, 8)>
