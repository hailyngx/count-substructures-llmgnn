Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 5
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges, which form a 3-star structure.

Let's find the 3-stars in the graph:
1. In this graph, the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes are: nodes 0, 1, 5, 7.

Listing unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 5, 9)>
<1, (0, 2, 6)>
<5, (0, 3, 7)>
<7, (1, 5, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4]. 
<1, (0, 2, 6)>, <0, (1, 5, 9)>, <5, (0, 3, 7)>, <7, (1, 5, 6)>
