Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Looking at the adjacency list, we can see that nodes 0, 2, and 8 fit the definition of a central node for a potential 3-star, as they are each connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's consider each of these potential central nodes one by one and check if they form valid 3-stars:

1. For node 0:
   Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, and 5.
   This forms the following 3-stars:
   <0, (1, 3, 4)>
   <0, (1, 3, 5)>

2. For node 2:
   Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 7.
   This forms the following 3-star:
   <2, (1, 5, 7)>

3. For node 8:
   Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 0.
   This forms the following 3-star:
   <8, (0, 2, 0)>

Counting all the unique 3-stars, we have:
