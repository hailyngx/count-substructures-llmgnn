Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 1) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 0) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 8

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

The nodes that are connected to exactly 3 other nodes are: 0, 1, and 8.

For node 0:
- <0, (2, 6, 8)>
- <0, (2, 8, 6)> [Repeated]
- <0, (6, 2, 8)> [Repeated]
- <0, (6, 8, 2)> [Repeated]
- <0, (8, 2, 6)> [Repeated]
- <0, (8, 6, 2)> [Repeated]

For node 1:
- <1, (2, 3, 5)>
- <1, (2, 5, 3)> [Repeated]
- <1, (3, 2, 5)> [Repeated]
- <1, (3, 5, 2)> [Repeated]
- <1, (5, 2, 3)> [Repeated]
- <1, (5, 3, 2)> [Repeated]

For node 8:
- <8, (0, 4, 9)>
- <8, (0, 9, 4)> [Repeated]
- <8, (4, 0, 9)> [Repeated]
- <8, (4, 9, 0)> [Repeated]
- <8, (9, 0, 4)> [Repeated]
- <8, (9, 4, 0)> [Repeated]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [18]. 

The unique 3-stars are <0, (2, 6, 8)>, <1, (2, 3, 5)>, and <8, (0, 4, 9)>.
