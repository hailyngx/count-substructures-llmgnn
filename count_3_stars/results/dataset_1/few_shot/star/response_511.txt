Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 8

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph. Since a 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three nodes (leaves), we can determine the 3-stars by looking at nodes with exactly 3 edges.

Looking at the adjacency list, the nodes with exactly 3 edges are:
- Node 2 (connected to node 3)
- Node 5 (connected to node 0 and 8)
- Node 6 (connected to node 0 and 1)
- Node 9 (connected to node 4, 7, 8)

Therefore, the 3-stars in the given graph are as follows:
<2, (3, ***)>
<5, (0, 8, ***)>
<6, (0, 1, ***)>
<9, (4, 7, 8)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we have found four different 3-stars in the graph.

So, the answer is [4].
