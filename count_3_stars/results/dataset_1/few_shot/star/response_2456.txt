Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 6

Response:
Step 1: Identify the central nodes with exactly 3 neighbors.
In this graph, the central nodes with exactly 3 neighbors are nodes 0, 2, and 8.

Step 2: For each central node, find the connected leaves.
For node 0: Leaves are nodes 1, 2, and 5
For node 2: Leaves are nodes 4, 6, and 8
For node 8: Leaves are nodes 2 and 5

Step 3: Count the number of unique 3-stars.
Number of unique 3-stars: [4]

<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<2, (4, 6, 8)>
<8, (2, 5)>
