Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star. 

By definition, a 3-star graph consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<1, (0, 4, 5)>
<3, (5, 7, 9)>
<5, (1, 3, 9)>
<6, (0, 2, 8)>
<8, (2, 3, 6)>
<9, (1, 5, 7)>

Therefore, there are a total of [7] 3-stars in the given graph.
