Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for central nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them, forming a 3-star configuration with the connected nodes as leaves.

Based on the provided adjacency list, the following nodes have exactly three edges connected to them:
- Node 2: Connected to nodes 6, 7, and 8
- Node 6: Connected to nodes 2, 5, and 7
- Node 7: Connected to nodes 0, 1, and 9

Now, let's find the 3-stars in the graph:

<2, (6, 7, 8)>
<6, (2, 5, 7)>
<7, (0, 1, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
