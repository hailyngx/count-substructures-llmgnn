Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible combinations of a central node and its three connected nodes.

Let's identify the 3-stars:
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<1, (0, 3, 5)>
<2, (0, 5, 6)>
<3, (0, 1, 4)>
<4, (2, 3)>
<5, (1, 2, 6)>
<6, (2, 5, 9)>
<7, (8, 9)>
<8, (5, 7)>
<9, (1, 2, 6)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we get [9].
