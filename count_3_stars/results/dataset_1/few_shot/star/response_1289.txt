Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Identify the nodes that can act as centers for 3-stars:
   - Node 0 connects to 4 other nodes: 1, 4, 5, and 7.
   - Node 4 connects to 6 other nodes: 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7.
   
2. Count the number of unique 3-stars:
   - For each node that can act as a center for a 3-star, determine the connected nodes that form 3-stars.
   - Count the total number of unique 3-stars.

Let's proceed with finding the unique 3-stars:

[3]

<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<4, (0, 2, 7)>
