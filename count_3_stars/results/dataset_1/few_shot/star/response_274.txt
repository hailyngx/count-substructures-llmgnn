Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern. 

Let's go through each possible central node and its corresponding leaves to find the 3-stars:
1. Central Node 0:
    - (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5)
    - <0, (2, 4, 5)>

2. Central Node 1:
    - (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 9)
    - <1, (2, 6, 7)> 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
