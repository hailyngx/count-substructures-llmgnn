Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern.

Looking at the adjacency list, we can see that the nodes with three connections are: 1, 3, 4, and 6.

For node 1, possible 3-stars are:
- <1, (0, 6, 9)>
- <1, (0, 6, 9)>
Total 3-stars for node 1: 2

For node 3, possible 3-stars are:
- <3, (4, 5, 8)>
- <3, (4, 5, 8)>
Total 3-stars for node 3: 2

For node 4, possible 3-stars are:
- <4, (3, 7, 9)>
- <4, (3, 7, 9)>
Total 3-stars for node 4: 2

For node 6, possible 3-stars are:
- <6, (1, 5, 7)>
- <6, (1, 5, 7)>
Total 3-stars for node 6: 2

Now, let's sum up the total number of 3-stars:
2 (from node 1) + 2 (from node 3) + 2 (from node 4) + 2 (from node 6) = 8
