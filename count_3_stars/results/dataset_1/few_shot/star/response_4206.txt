Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 7

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are as follows:
<0, (1, 7, 8)>
<1, (0, 4, 5)>
<5, (1, 3, 9)>
<7, (0, 4, 9)>
