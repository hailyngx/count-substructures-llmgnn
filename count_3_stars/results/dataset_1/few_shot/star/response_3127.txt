Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern.

Let's go through the adjacency list for each node to identify the 3-stars:

- Node 0: No 3-stars
- Node 1: No 3-stars
- Node 2: No 3-stars
- Node 3: No 3-stars
- Node 4: <4, (0, 1, 2)>
- Node 5: No 3-stars
- Node 6: No 3-stars
- Node 7: No 3-stars
- Node 8: No 3-stars
- Node 9: No 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1].

The unique 3-star found is: <4, (0, 1, 2)>
