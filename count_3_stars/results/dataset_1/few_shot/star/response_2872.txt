Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 3

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges, creating a 3-star pattern centered at that node.

Looking at the adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (1, 4, 8)>
<1, (0, 6, 2)>
<3, (8, 9, -)>
<4, (0, 7, -)>
<7, (4, 5, -)>

Therefore, there are a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
