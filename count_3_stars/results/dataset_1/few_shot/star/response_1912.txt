Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 3

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

We will look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will serve as the centers of the 3-stars.

From the adjacency list, we can see that nodes 0, 1, 4, 7, 8, and 9 are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list the 3-star structures with these nodes as the center:

<Node 0, (4, 7, 5)>
<Node 4, (0, 5, 7)>
<Node 7, (0, 4, 5)>
<Node 8, (1, 3, 4)>
<Node 9, (1, 3, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
