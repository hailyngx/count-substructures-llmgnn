Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all possible 3-stars. A 3-star in this context consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

From the adjacency list provided, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<4, (0, 1, 2)>
<4, (0, 1, 5)>
<4, (1, 2, 5)>
<4, (0, 2, 5)>
<4, (5, 8, 0)>
<4, (5, 8, 1)>
<4, (5, 8, 2)>
<5, (0, 1, 4)>
<5, (0, 1, 8)>
<5, (1, 4, 8)>
<5, (4, 8, 0)>
<5, (4, 8, 1)>
<5, (4, 8, 2)>
<8, (4, 5, 9)>
<8, (5, 9, 0)>
<8, (5, 9, 1)>
<8, (5, 9, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [17].
