Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 3

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the unique occurrences of 3-stars.

Let's list the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (2, 6, 7)>
<1, (4, 8, 9)>
<2, (0, 6, 8)>
<3, (8, 9)>
<4, (1)>
<6, (0, 2, 8)>
<7, (0, 1)>
<8, (1, 3, 6)>
<9, (1, 3)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph:
[9]
