Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 3

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes forming a star pattern.

Based on the given information, the nodes connected to other nodes are as follows: 

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 7, and 8
- Node 1 is connected to node 8
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 6, 7, and 8
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 8, and 9
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 5
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 3 and 4
- Node 6 is connected to node 2
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0 and 2
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3
- Node 9 is connected to node 3

Let's now identify the 3-star patterns:

- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 7, and 8 
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 7, and 8
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 5, and 8

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].

Unique 3-stars found:
<0, (4, 7, 8)>
<2, (6, 7, 8)>
<3, (4, 5, 8)>
