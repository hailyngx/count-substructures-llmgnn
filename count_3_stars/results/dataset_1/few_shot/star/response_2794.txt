Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 2

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0 is a center with leaves 1, 3, and 6: <0, (1, 3, 6)>
2. Node 1 is a center with leaves 0, 4, and 5: <1, (0, 4, 5)>
3. Node 2 is a center with leaves 3, 5, and 9: <2, (3, 5, 9)>
4. Node 3 is a center with leaves 0, 2, and 7: <3, (0, 2, 7)>
5. Node 4 is a center with leaves 1, 5, and 7: <4, (1, 5, 7)>
6. Node 5 is a center with leaves 1, 4, and 7: <5, (1, 4, 7)>
7. Node 7 is a center with leaves 0, 2, and 4: <7, (0, 2, 4)>
8. Node 8 is not a center of any 3-star.
9. Node 9 is a center with leaves 0, 2, and 0: <9, (0, 2, 0)>

Count of 3-stars: [8]
