Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 9) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances of a 3-star pattern, where a central node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes. Here's how we can find the 3-stars:

Based on the adjacency list, we can determine the following 3-stars:
<0, (1, 9)>
<1, (0, 7)>
<2, (7, 9)>
<7, (1, 2, 9)>
<7, (1, 2, 8)>
<7, (2, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6]. 
Here are the unique 3-stars found: 
<0, (1, 9)>
<1, (0, 7)>
<2, (7, 9)>
<7, (1, 2, 9)>
<7, (1, 2, 8)>
<7, (2, 8, 9)>
