Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 9) (6, 2) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first identify all unique 3-stars present in the graph.

Based on the definition provided, each 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Given the adjacency list, we can find the 3-stars in the graph:

1. <0, (2, 3, 4)>
2. <0, (2, 3, 7)>
3. <0, (3, 1, 9)>
4. <0, (3, 2, 9)>
  
Combining the unique 3-stars found:
[4]
