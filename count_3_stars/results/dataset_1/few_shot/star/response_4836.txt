Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 4, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 6

Response:
Based on the given graph, the 3-stars can be counted as follows:
1. Node 0 with neighbors 1, 3, 4: <0, (1, 3, 4)>
2. Node 1 with neighbors 0, 3, 4: <1, (0, 3, 4)>
3. Node 2 with neighbors 1, 4, 5: <2, (1, 4, 5)>
4. Node 3 with neighbors 0, 1, 4: <3, (0, 1, 4)>
5. Node 4 with neighbors 0, 1, 2: <4, (0, 1, 2)>
6. Node 5 with neighbors 0, 2, 6: <5, (0, 2, 6)>
7. Node 6 with neighbors 0, 1, 2: <6, (0, 1, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
