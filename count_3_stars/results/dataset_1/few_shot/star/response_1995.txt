Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph step by step:

1. Identify nodes that can act as the center of a 3-star. These are nodes with exactly 3 neighbors.
   - Nodes that can act as the center: 2, 4, 5, 6, 7

2. For each potential center node, check if it forms a 3-star with its neighbors.

   For node 2:
   - <2, (3, 5, 8)>
   - 1 unique 3-star for node 2

   For node 4:
   - <4, (5, 6, 8)>
   - 1 unique 3-star for node 4

   For node 5:
   - <5, (2, 4, 6)>
   - 1 unique 3-star for node 5

   For node 6:
   - <6, (4, 5, 8)>
   - 1 unique 3-star for node 6

   For node 7:
   Node 7 does not have exactly 3 neighbors, so it cannot be the center of a 3-star.

3. Count the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph.
   - Total unique 3-stars: <2, (3, 5, 8)>, <4, (5, 6, 8)>, <5, (2, 4, 6)>, <6, (4, 5, 8)>
   - [4] 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
