Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 5

Response:
Starting from each node, we can look for 3-stars where that node is the center. Let's list them out step by step:

1. For Node 0:
<0, (1, 4, 8)>
Total 3-stars: 1

2. For Node 1:
<1, (0, 4, 8)>
<1, (0, 4, 9)>
Total 3-stars: 2

3. For Node 2:
No 3-stars as the center.

4. For Node 3:
<3, (4, 5, 6)>
Total 3-stars: 1

5. For Node 4:
<4, (0, 1, 9)>
<4, (3, 5, 9)>
Total 3-stars: 2

6. For Node 5:
<5, (2, 4, 9)>
<5, (3, 4, 9)>
Total 3-stars: 2

7. For Node 6:
<6, (2, 3, 8)>
Total 3-stars: 1

8. For Node 7:
No 3-stars as the center.

9. For Node 8:
<8, (0, 1, 6)>
Total 3-stars: 1

10. For Node 9:
No 3-stars as the center.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10]. 
The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 4, 8)>
<1, (0, 4, 9)>
<3, (4, 5, 6)>
<4, (0, 1, 9)>
<4, (3, 5, 9)>
<5, (2, 4, 9)>
<5, (3, 4, 9)>
<6, (2, 3, 8)>
<8, (0, 1, 6)>
