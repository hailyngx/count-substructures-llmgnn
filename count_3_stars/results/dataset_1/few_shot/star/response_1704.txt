Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 4

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the 3-stars. The central nodes will be the nodes with exactly three edges connected to them. In this case, the central nodes are 5 and 6.

Next, we will find the leaf nodes in the 3-stars connected to each central node.

For central node 5:
- Nodes connected to 5: 1, 3, 6, 8
Considering all pairs of nodes connected to central node 5, we find the 3-stars:
1. <5, (1, 3, 6)>
2. <5, (1, 3, 8)>
3. <5, (1, 6, 8)>
4. <5, (3, 6, 8)>

For central node 6:
- Nodes connected to 6: 0, 2, 5, 7, 8
Considering all pairs of nodes connected to central node 6, we find the 3-stars:
1. <6, (0, 5, 7)>
2. <6, (0, 5, 8)>
3. <6, (0, 7, 8)>
4. <6, (2, 5, 7)>
5. <6, (2, 5, 8)>
6. <6, (2, 7, 8)>
7. <6, (5, 7, 8)>

Finally, we count the total number of 3-stars:
