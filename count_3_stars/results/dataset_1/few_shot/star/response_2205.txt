Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star pattern. 

Let's analyze each node to find 3-stars:
- Node 0 is not part of any 3-star.
- Node 1 is part of one 3-star: <1, (2, 6, 3)>
- Node 2 is part of five 3-stars: <2, (0, 1, 6)>, <2, (6, 7, 8)>, <2, (7, 8, 9)>, <2, (8, 9, 6)>, <2, (9, 6, 1)>
- Node 3 is not part of any 3-star.
- Node 4 is part of one 3-star: <4, (5, 8, 6)>
- Node 5 is not part of any 3-star.
- Node 6 is part of one 3-star: <6, (1, 9, 2)>
- Node 7 is not part of any 3-star.
- Node 8 is part of one 3-star: <8, (2, 9, 4)>
- Node 9 is not part of any 3-star.

Finally, counting the total number of unique 3-stars gives us the answer: [7]. 
The unique 3-stars are: <1, (2, 6, 3)>, <2, (0, 1, 6)>, <2, (6, 7, 8)>, <2, (7, 8, 9)>, <2, (8, 9, 6)>, <2, (9, 6, 1)>, <4, (5, 8, 6)>.
