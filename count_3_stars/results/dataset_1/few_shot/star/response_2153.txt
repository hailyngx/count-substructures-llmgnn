Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 7, and node 8

Response:
Let's find the number of 3-stars in this graph step by step:

1. Look for nodes with at least 3 neighbors:
   - Node 0 has neighbors 2, 3, 4, 6, and 9 (degree 5)
   - Node 1 has neighbors 3, 4, and 9 (degree 3)
   - Node 2 has neighbors 0, 4, 5, and 9 (degree 4)
   - Node 3 has neighbors 0, 1, 5, and 8 (degree 4)
   - Node 4 has neighbors 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, and 7 (degree 6)
   - Node 5 has neighbors 2, 3, and 4 (degree 3)
   - Node 6 has neighbors 0, 4, and 8 (degree 3)
   - Node 7 has neighbors 4, 8, and 9 (degree 3)
   - Node 8 has neighbors 3, 6, 7, and 9 (degree 4)
   - Node 9 has neighbors 0, 1, 2, 7, and 8 (degree 5)

2. Identify 3-stars:
   - For each node with degree at least 3, check if it forms a 3-star structure with its neighbors.

The 3-star structures are as follows:
<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<0, (2, 4, 9)>
<0, (3, 4, 6)>
<0, (4, 6, 9)>
<0, (4, 7, 9)>
<0, (6, 7, 9)>
<1, (3, 4, 9)>
<2, (0, 4, 5)>
<3, (0, 5, 8)>
<4, (0, 2, 5)>
<4, (0, 5, 6)>
<4, (0, 5, 7)>
<4, (1, 2, 5)>
<4, (1, 5, 6)>
<4, (1, 5, 7)>
<4, (2, 5, 6)>
<4, (2, 5, 7)>
<4, (5, 6, 7)>
<7, (4, 8, 9)>
<8, (3, 6, 9)>
<8, (6, 7, 9)>
<8, (7, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [23].
