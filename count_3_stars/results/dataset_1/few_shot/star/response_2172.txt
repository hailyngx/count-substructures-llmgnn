Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 8

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node and count the number of 3-stars around it. 

Let's start by listing the 3-stars in the graph:

<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<4, (1, 3, 8)>
<6, (1, 5, 7)>
<8, (0, 4, 9)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars by counting the unique combinations:

[4]
