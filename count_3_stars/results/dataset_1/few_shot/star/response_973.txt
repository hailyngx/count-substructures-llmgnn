Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 5, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars present. 

From the adjacency list, we can see that nodes 1, 6, and 9 are the only nodes with exactly 3 connections, which makes them potential centers of 3-stars.

Now, let's find the 3-stars in the graph:
- Center: Node 1
  - <1, (2, 6, 7)>
  - <1, (2, 6, 8)>
  - <1, (2, 6, 9)>
  - <1, (6, 7, 4)>
  - <1, (6, 8, 4)>
  - <1, (6, 9, 0)>
  - <1, (6, 9, 4)>
- Center: Node 6
  - <6, (1, 2, 9)>
  - <6, (1, 3, 9)>
  - <6, (1, 8, 4)>
  - <6, (2, 1, 9)>
  - <6, (2, 3, 9)>
  - <6, (2, 8, 4)>
  - <6, (3, 1, 9)>
  - <6, (3, 2, 9)>
  - <6, (8, 1, 4)>
- Center: Node 9
  - <9, (0, 1, 6)>
  - <9, (0, 5, 6)>
  - <9, (1, 4, 6)>
  - <9, (4, 1, 6)>
  - <9, (4, 5, 6)>
  - <9, (5, 0, 6)>

Count of 3-stars: [19]
