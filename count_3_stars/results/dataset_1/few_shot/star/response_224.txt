Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 5
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 8

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are:
- <1, (4, 3, 8)>
- <8, (1, 5, 9)>
- <9, (0, 2, 8)>

So the total number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [3].
