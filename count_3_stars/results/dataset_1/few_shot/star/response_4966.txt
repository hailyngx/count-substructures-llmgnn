Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 2
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are as follows:
<2, (3, 6, 8)>
<6, (2, 4, 5)>
<7, (0, 2, 6)>

[There are 3 unique 3-stars in the graph.]
