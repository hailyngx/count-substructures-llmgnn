Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star pattern.

Looking at the adjacency list:

- Node 0 is not part of any 3-stars since it is connected to 4 other nodes.
- Node 1 is part of two 3-stars: <1, (0, 3, 7)> and <1, (4, 5, 7)>.
- Node 2 is not part of any 3-stars since it is connected to only 2 other nodes.
- Node 3 is part of two 3-stars: <3, (0, 1, 2)> and <3, (4, 7, 9)>.
- Node 4 is not part of any 3-stars since it is connected to 3 other nodes.
- Node 5 is not part of any 3-stars since it is connected to 3 other nodes.
- Node 6 is not part of any 3-stars since it is connected to 2 other nodes.
- Node 7 is not part of any 3-stars since it is connected to 2 other nodes.
- Node 8 is not part of any 3-stars since it is connected to 1 other node.
- Node 9 is part of one 3-star: <9, (3, 4, 6)>.

Count of 3-stars: [4]

Unique 3-stars:
<1, (0, 3, 7)>
<1, (4, 5, 7)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<3, (4, 7, 9)>
