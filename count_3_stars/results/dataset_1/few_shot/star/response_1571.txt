Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can identify all possible 3-stars by looking for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Then we can count how many such 3-stars exist in the graph. 

Let's go step by step to find the 3-stars:
1. Starting with the adjacency list, we identify nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
- From the adjacency list, we see that nodes 1, 2, 3, and 8 fit this criteria.

2. Next, we determine the leaves connected to each of these potential central nodes:
- For node 1: (0, 2, 8)
- For node 2: (1, 3, 4)
- For node 3: (2, 5, 8)
- For node 8: (1, 3, 4, 6)

3. Now, we construct the 3-stars using the central node and its three leaves:
- For node 1: <1, (0, 2, 8)>
- For node 2: <2, (1, 3, 4)>
- For node 3: <3, (2, 5, 8)>
- For node 8: <8, (1, 3, 4)>  

Count of 3-stars: [4]
Unique 3-stars: <1, (0, 2, 8)> <2, (1, 3, 4)> <3, (2, 5, 8)> <8, (1, 3, 4)>
