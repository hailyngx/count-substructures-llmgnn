Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 6, and node 7

Response:
The center of a 3-star must have a degree of 3 and be connected to exactly three leaves. Let's identify the nodes that satisfy this condition.

- Node 0 has a degree of 2 (connected to 2 nodes).
- Node 1 has a degree of 5 (connected to 5 nodes).
- Node 2 has a degree of 3 (connected to 3 nodes: 1, 7, 8).
- Node 3 has a degree of 2 (connected to 2 nodes).
- Node 4 has a degree of 1 (connected to 1 node).
- Node 5 has a degree of 3 (connected to 3 nodes: 0, 1, 8).
- Node 6 has a degree of 2 (connected to 2 nodes).
- Node 7 has a degree of 3 (connected to 3 nodes: 2, 6, 9).
- Node 8 has a degree of 3 (connected to 3 nodes: 1, 2, 5).
- Node 9 has a degree of 2 (connected to 2 nodes).

Based on the given information, the unique 3-stars in the graph are:

<1, (2, 7, 8)>
<2, (1, 7, 8)>
<5, (0, 1, 8)>
<7, (2, 6, 9)>
<8, (1, 2, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
