Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, first, we need to identify all possible 3-stars. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list the possible 3-stars in the graph:

1. <0, (1, 6, 9)>
2. <1, (0, 3, 4)>
3. <1, (0, 4, 5)>
4. <1, (3, 4, 5)>
5. <1, (4, 6, 7)>
6. <1, (4, 5, 7)>
7. <2, (4, 5, -)>
8. <3, (1, 4, 5)>
9. <4, (1, 2, 3)>  
10. <4, (1, 6, 7)>
11. <4, (1, 7, 9)>
12. <4, (2, 6, 7)>
13. <4, (2, 7, -)>
14. <4, (3, 6, 5)>
15. <4, (3, 7, 5)>
16. <4, (6, 7, -)>
17. <4, (7, 9, -)>
18. <5, (1, 2, 3)>
19. <5, (1, 6, 7)>
20. <5, (1, 7, 9)>
21. <5, (2, 6, 4)>
22. <5, (2, 7, 4)>
23. <5, (3, 6, 4)>
24. <5, (3, 7, 4)>
25. <5, (6, 7, -)>
26. <5, (7, 9, -)>
27. <6, (0, 4, 7)>
28. <7, (4, 5, 9)>  
29. <9, (0, 4, 5)>
30. <9, (4, 5, 7)>

There are a total of [30] 3-stars in the given graph.
