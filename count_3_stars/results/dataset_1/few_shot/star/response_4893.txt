Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 1

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Given the information provided, the nodes that form 3-stars are as follows:

<0, (2, 5, 6)>
<1, (7, 8, 9)>
<2, (0, 4, 5)>
<4, (2, 5, 7)>
<5, (0, 2, 4)>
<7, (1, 3, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
