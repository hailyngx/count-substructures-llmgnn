Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can identify each 3-star by finding nodes that meet the criteria of having a center node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (2, 7, 8)>
<1, (3, 4, 5)>
<2, (0, 7, 8)>
<3, (1, 5, 6)>
<4, (1, 5, 7)>
<5, (1, 3, 4)>
<7, (0, 2, 4)>
<9, (1, 4, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
