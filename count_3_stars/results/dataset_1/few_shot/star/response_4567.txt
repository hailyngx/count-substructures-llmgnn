Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 5, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all unique 3-stars. 

From the adjacency list, we can see that the three-node stars in this graph are as follows:
<2, (0, 7, 8)>
<4, (1, 5, 7)>
<9, (2, 3, 4)>
<9, (2, 4, 5)>
<9, (3, 4, 5)>
<1, (4, 5, 7)>
<5, (1, 4, 9)>
<7, (1, 4, 9)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars inside brackets []: [8].
