Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars in the given graph. 
Since a 3-star has a center node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can look for nodes that have exactly three neighbors.

From the adjacency list, the nodes that have exactly three neighbors are:
- Node 2 (neighbors: 1, 7, total: 3)
- Node 3 (neighbors: 9, total: 1)
- Node 5 (neighbors: 1, 7, total: 2)

Therefore, there are no 3-stars in this graph. 

Hence, the number of 3-stars [] = 0.
