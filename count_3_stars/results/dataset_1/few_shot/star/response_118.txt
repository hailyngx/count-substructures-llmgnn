Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will identify all the 3-stars by finding all the nodes which have exactly three neighbors and are connected to all three neighbors forming a 3-star.

1. From the adjacency list, we can identify the nodes with exactly three neighbors:
   - Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 1, 2, 5
   - Node 2 has 2 neighbors: 0, 4
   - Node 3 has 1 neighbor: 5
   - Node 6 has 2 neighbors: 4, 5
   - Node 9 has 2 neighbors: 4, 8

2. Now, we will look for 3-stars with the identified nodes as the center:
   - For Node 0:
     - <0, (1, 2, 5)>
   - For Node 2:
     - <2, (0, 4, 6)>
   - For Node 3, Node 6, and Node 9, we cannot form any 3-stars as they do not have exactly 3 neighbors.

3. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2]. 
   The unique 3-stars found are: 
   - <0, (1, 2, 5)>
   - <2, (0, 4, 6)>
