Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 24 edges, we need to count the number of 3-star subgraphs within it.

To do this, we need to identify all the 3-stars in the graph. A 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Let's list down all the unique 3-stars in this graph:

<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<1, (5, 6, 8)>

As we have listed down all the 3-stars in the graph, let's count the total number of 3-stars: [2].
