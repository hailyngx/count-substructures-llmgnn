Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 5

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (2, 8, 5)>
<1, (7, 9, 5)>
<2, (0, 5, 6)>
<3, (6, 7, 9)>
<4, (5, 6, 0)>
<5, (2, 4, 8)>
<6, (2, 3, 4)>
<7, (1, 3, 9)>
<8, (0, 5, 2)>
<9, (1, 5, 3)>

There are 10 unique 3-stars in total. 
So, the final answer is [10].
