Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will look for unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern. 

Starting with each node, here are the 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (1, 3, 8)>
<1, (0, 7, 8)>
<2, (4, 7, 0)>
<3, (0, 4, 5)>
<4, (2, 3, 0)>
<5, (3, 8, 9)>
<7, (1, 2, 0)>
<8, (0, 1, 5)>
<9, (3, 5, 0)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars in the given graph, we can see that there are [9] 3-stars. 

Therefore, the final answer is [9].
