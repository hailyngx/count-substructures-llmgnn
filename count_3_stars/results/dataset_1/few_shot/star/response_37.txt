Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the given graph, node 0, node 6, and node 9 satisfy the definition of a center of a 3-star as they are each connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's identify the 3-stars:
<0, (2, 6, 9)>
<6, (0, 7, 9)>
<9, (0, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
