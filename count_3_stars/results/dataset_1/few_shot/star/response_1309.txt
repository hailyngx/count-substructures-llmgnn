Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern.

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the given graph:
<0, (2, 3, 6)>
<0, (2, 6, 7)>
<2, (0, 6, 9)>
<6, (0, 2, 4)>
<6, (0, 4, 5)>
<6, (2, 4, 5)>
<6, (4, 5, 7)>
