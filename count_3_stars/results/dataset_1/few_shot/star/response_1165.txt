Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 7

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph based on the definition given. We need to find nodes that are adjacent to exactly three other nodes.

From the adjacency list, the nodes that satisfy this condition are:
- Node 0 (connected to 2, 8, 9)
- Node 1 (connected to 5, 7)
- Node 4 (connected to 2, 3, 8)
- Node 9 (connected to 0, 4, 7)

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (2, 8, 9)>
<1, (5, 7)>
<4, (2, 3, 8)>
<9, (0, 4, 7)>

Counting the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph, we have a total of [4].
