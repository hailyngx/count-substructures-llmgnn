Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, 6, and node 8

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 3-stars are formed when a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Here are the 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (2, 7, 8)>
<0, (2, 8, 9)>
<0, (7, 8, 9)>
<2, (0, 4, 5)>
<4, (2, 6, 9)>
<4, (5, 6, 9)>
<4, (6, 9, 8)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph.
