Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the 3-stars present based on the given edges and adjacency list. 

Let's list down all the 3-stars:

<0, (1, 5, 6)>  
<0, (1, 5, 7)>  
<0, (1, 6, 8)>  
<0, (1, 7, 8)>  
<0, (3, 5, 6)>  
<0, (3, 5, 7)>  
<0, (3, 6, 8)>  
<0, (3, 7, 8)>  
<5, (0, 6, 7)>  
<5, (6, 0, 7)>  
<5, (7, 0, 6)>  
<6, (0, 5, 8)>  
<6, (5, 0, 8)>  
<6, (8, 0, 5)>  
<7, (0, 5, 8)>  
<7, (5, 0, 8)>  
<7, (8, 0, 5)>  

Counting all the unique 3-stars, we get a total of 16 unique 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [16].
