Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 3) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 2

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each possible 3-star configuration, which involves a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's identify the unique 3-stars in this graph:

List of 3-stars:
<0, (1, 4, 9)>
<2, (4, 6, 9)>
<3, (5, 7, 8)>

[Final Answer: [3]]
