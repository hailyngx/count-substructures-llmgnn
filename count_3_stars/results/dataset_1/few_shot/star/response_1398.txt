Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes forming a star-like structure. 

Looking at the adjacency list given:
- Node 0 is connected to 5 other nodes (2, 3, 4, 6, 7)
- Node 1 is connected to 1 node, which is not enough for a 3-star.
- Node 2 is connected to 4 other nodes (0, 6, 7, 8)
- Node 3 is connected to 3 other nodes (0, 5, 7), forming a 3-star with Node 3 as the center and Node 0, 5, 7 as leaves. <3, (0, 5, 7)>
- Node 4 is connected to 4 other nodes (0, 6, 8, 9)
- Node 5 is connected to 1 node, which is not enough for a 3-star.
- Node 6 is connected to 5 other nodes (0, 1, 2, 4, 8)
- Node 7 is connected to 4 other nodes (0, 2, 3, 8)
- Node 8 is connected to 5 other nodes (2, 4, 6, 7, 9)
- Node 9 is connected to 2 other nodes, which is not enough for a 3-star.

Therefore, the unique 3-star found in the graph is <3, (0, 5, 7)>.

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1].
