Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges forming a 3-star pattern. Here is a step-by-step solution:

1. Identify all possible 3-stars in the graph:
   Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (6, 8, 9)>
   Node 2 forms a 3-star: <2, (5, 6, 7)> and <2, (6, 7, 5)>
   Node 6 forms two 3-stars: <6, (1, 8, 9)> and <6, (2, 3, 9)>

2. Since there are duplicated 3-stars for node 2, we list them only once to avoid repetition:
   <1, (6, 8, 9)>
   <2, (5, 6, 7)>
   <6, (1, 8, 9)>
   <6, (2, 3, 9)>

3. Count the total number of unique 3-stars: [4]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
