Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 2
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

1. <1, (3, 6, 8)>
2. <6, (1, 3, 7)>
3. <8, (1, 6, 9)>

Count of 3-stars in the graph: [3]
