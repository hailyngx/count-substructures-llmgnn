Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all unique instances where a node is at the center of a 3-star. 

Analyzing the given graph, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (1, 3, 6)>
<1, (0, 4, 5)>
<4, (1, 7, 8)>
<5, (1, 6, 7)>
<8, (4, 5, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [5]. 
<0, (1, 3, 6)>, <1, (0, 4, 5)>, <4, (1, 7, 8)>, <5, (1, 6, 7)>, <8, (4, 5, 9)>
