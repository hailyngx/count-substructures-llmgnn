Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node:

Node 6 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we can look for each node that has exactly three neighbors and treat it as the center of a potential 3-star. We then verify if these four nodes (center + 3 neighbors) form a 3-star structure. 

Starting with the adjacency list provided, the nodes with exactly three neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 1 neighbor
- Node 1: 2 neighbors
- Node 2: 5 neighbors
- Node 3: 5 neighbors
- Node 4: 6 neighbors
- Node 5: 2 neighbors
- Node 6: 5 neighbors
- Node 7: 3 neighbors
- Node 8: 5 neighbors
- Node 9: 3 neighbors

Therefore, possible 3-star configurations can only be formed by nodes 7, 8, and 9. Let's verify these potential 3-stars:
- 3-star centered at node 7: (7, 2, 3, 8)
- 3-star centered at node 8: (8, 2, 3, 9)
- 3-star centered at node 9: (9, 2, 6, 8)

Hence, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].  
The unique 3-stars found are:  
<7, (2, 3, 8)>  
<8, (2, 3, 9)>  
<9, (2, 6, 8)>
