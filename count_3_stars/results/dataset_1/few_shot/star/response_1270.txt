Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 5
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
To count the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern.

Based on the adjacency list and the definition of a 3-star graph, we can identify the following 3-stars:

<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<1, (0, 2, 5)>
<2, (1, 4, 5)>
<3, (1, 6, 7)>
<5, (0, 1, 2)>
<6, (0, 1, 2)>
<7, (1, 2, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [7]. 

Here are the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<1, (0, 2, 5)>
<2, (1, 4, 5)>
<3, (1, 6, 7)>
<5, (0, 1, 2)>
<6, (0, 1, 2)>
<7, (1, 2, 3)>
