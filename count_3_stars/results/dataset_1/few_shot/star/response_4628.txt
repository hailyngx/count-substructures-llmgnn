Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in the form of a star. Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Starting with node 0:
    - <0, (1, 2, 4)>
    - <0, (1, 4, 7)>

2. Moving to node 1:
    - <1, (0, 8, 9)>
    - <1, (6, 8, 9)>

3. Moving to node 2:
    - <2, (0, 4, 7)>
    - <2, (4, 7, 9)>

4. From node 4:
    - <4, (0, 2, 7)>
    - <4, (3, 5, 6)>
    - <4, (5, 6, 7)>
    - <4, (6, 7, 8)>

5. From node 5:
    - <5, (4, 6, 9)>
    - <5, (6, 9, 4)>

6. From node 6:
    - <6, (1, 4, 5)>
    - <6, (4, 5, 9)>
    - <6, (5, 9, 1)>

7. From node 8:
    - <8, (1, 4, 9)>
    - <8, (4, 9, 1)>
    - <8, (9, 1, 4)>

8. From node 9:
    - <9, (1, 2, 8)>
    - <9, (2, 8, 1)>

As we found all the unique 3-stars, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is counted to be [20].
