Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star-like pattern. Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (3, 5, 8)>
<3, (0, 4, 5)>
<4, (3, 7, 8)>
<5, (0, 3, 6)>
<7, (3, 4, 6)>
<8, (0, 4, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
