Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are:
<0, (4, 7, 8)>
<1, (2, 3, 9)>
<2, (1, 3, 9)>
<3, (2, 7, 9)>
<4, (0, 7, 8)>
<5, (8)>
<6, (7, 8)>
<7, (0, 3, 4)>
<8, (0, 5, 6)>
<9, (1, 3, 7)>

[Total number of 3-stars: 10]
