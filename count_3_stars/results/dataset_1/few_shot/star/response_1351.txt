Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step by step:

1. Look for all nodes that have exactly three neighbors.
    - From the adjacency list:
        - Node 2 connects to nodes 1, 3, and 8.
        - Node 7 connects to nodes 1 and 8.
        - Node 4 connects to nodes 0 and 3.
        - Node 5 connects to node 6.
        
2. Now, for each node found in step 1, let's check if they form a 3-star configuration by identifying the neighbors they are connected to.
    - For Node 2: (1, 3, 8) forms a 3-star with Node 2 as the center. <2, (1, 3, 8)>
    - For Node 7: (1, 8) does not form a 3-star configuration since it has only two neighbors.
    - For Node 4: (0, 3) forms a 3-star with Node 4 as the center. <4, (0, 3)>
    - For Node 5: Not applicable since it only has one neighbor.

3. Calculate the number of unique 3-stars found.
    - Unique 3-stars found: <2, (1, 3, 8)>, <4, (0, 3)>
