Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (8, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 5

Response:
The number of three-stars can be determined by examining each node that is connected to three other nodes. 

From the given information, the nodes that meet this criterion are:
- Node 0 (connected to nodes 1, 6, 8)
- Node 1 (connected to nodes 0, 2, 3)
- Node 4 (connected to nodes 1, 2, 3)
- Node 9 (connected to nodes 4, 5)

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
- From node 0: <0, (1, 6, 8)>
- From node 1: <1, (0, 2, 3)>
- From node 4: <4, (1, 2, 3)>
- From node 9: <9, (4, 5)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
