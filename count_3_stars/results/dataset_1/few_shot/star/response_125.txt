Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 6

Response:
The center node and its adjacent nodes need to form a 3-star. Let's find all the 3-stars in this graph.

1. Node 1: (4, 8, 9)
2. Node 5: (0, 2, 9)

[There are 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph, so the final answer is [2].]
