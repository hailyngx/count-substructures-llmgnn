Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 6

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars present. 

Looking at the provided adjacency list and given edges, we can determine the 3-stars as follows:

1. <0, (1, 5, 6)>
2. <0, (5, 3, 6)>
3. <1, (0, 2, 4)>
4. <1, (2, 3, 4)>
5. <3, (2, 4, 5)>
6. <4, (1, 3, 5)>
7. <5, (0, 3, 4)>
8. <5, (3, 4, 6)>
9. <6, (0, 2, 5)>
10. <6, (2, 5, 8)>
11. <8, (2, 4, 5)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars above, we find that there are [11] 3-stars in the given graph.
