Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 1) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 8

Response:
Step 1: Identify the nodes with exactly 3 neighbors.
        Nodes with exactly 3 neighbors are: 1, 8, and 9.

Step 2: For each node identified in step 1, check if they form a 3-star.
        For node 1: (1, 2, 4), (1, 3, 8), (1, 9, 6)
        For node 8: (8, 0, 3), (8, 1, 9)
        For node 9: (9, 1, 6), (9, 8, 0)

Therefore, there are a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
        
<List of 3-stars>
<1, (2, 4)>
<1, (3, 8)>
<1, (9, 6)>
<8, (0, 3)>
<8, (1, 9)>
<9, (1, 6)>
