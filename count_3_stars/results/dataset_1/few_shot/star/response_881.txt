Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, and node 5

Response:
Let's start by identifying the 3-star graphs in the given graph. Remember that a 3-star graph consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Looking at the adjacency list, we can see that the possible center nodes are 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, and 9 since they have at least three connections.

Let's list the 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<1, (0, 7, 8)>
<2, (5, 7, 9)>
<3, (5, 8, 9)>
<5, (2, 3, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 2)>

Therefore, there are [6] 3-star graphs in the given graph.
