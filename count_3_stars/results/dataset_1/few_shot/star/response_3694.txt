Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the 3-stars present. 

Let's go through each node and its connections to find the 3-stars:
1. Node 0: (0, 3, 5)
2. Node 1: (1, 3, 5), (1, 5, 9)
3. Node 2: No connected nodes
4. Node 3: (3, 0, 5), (3, 1, 9), (3, 5, 8)
5. Node 4: No 3-stars possible since it has only one connection.
6. Node 5: (5, 0, 1), (5, 1, 9), (5, 3, 8)
7. Node 6: No 3-stars possible since it has only one connection.
8. Node 7: No connected nodes
9. Node 8: No 3-stars possible since it has only two connections.
10. Node 9: (9, 1, 5), (9, 1, 3)

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the graph are:
<0, (3, 5)>, <1, (3, 5)>, <1, (5, 9)>, <3, (0, 5)>, <3, (1, 9)>, <3, (5, 8)>, <5, (0, 1)>, <5, (1, 9)>, <5, (3, 8)>, <9, (1, 5)>, <9, (1, 3)> 

Count of unique 3-stars in the given graph: [11]
