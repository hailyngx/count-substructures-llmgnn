Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 6) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 3

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify sets of nodes where one node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

The 3-star structures in the graph are as follows:
<0, (1, 7, 9)>
<1, (0, 6, 7)>
<6, (1, 2, 5)>
<7, (0, 8, 9)>
<9, (0, 3, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 5.  
The final answer is [5].
