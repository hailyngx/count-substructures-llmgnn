Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Based on the adjacency list and the definition of a 3-star graph, we can identify the following unique 3-stars:
<0, (3, 5, 9)>
<1, (5, 7, 6)>
<2, (7, 9, 6)>
<3, (0, 9, 6)>
<6, (5, 7, 8)>
<7, (1, 2, 6)>
<9, (2, 3, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
