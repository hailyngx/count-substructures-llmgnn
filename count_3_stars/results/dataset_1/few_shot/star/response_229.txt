Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 4
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all occurrences where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step by step:

1. Identify nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
   - Node 2 is connected to nodes 5, 7, and 9.
   - Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 3.

2. Construct 3-stars with the identified nodes:
   - <2, (5, 7, 9)>
   - <7, (0, 2, 3)>

3. Count the total number of unique 3-stars: [2].
