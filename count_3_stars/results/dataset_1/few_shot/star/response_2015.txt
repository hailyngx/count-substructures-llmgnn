Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 6

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- Node 0 forms a 3-star: <0, (1, 2, 5)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (0, 2, 5)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star: <2, (0, 1, 7)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star: <3, (1, 4, 7)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star: <5, (0, 1, 7)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star: <7, (2, 3, 4)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star: <9, (0, 2, 3)>

Count of 3-stars: [7]
