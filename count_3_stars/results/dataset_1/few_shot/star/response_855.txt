Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

There are <0, (1, 4, 5)>, <1, (0, 2, 9)>, <3, (8, 9, 7)>, and <6, (0, 4, 7)> that represent 3-stars in the graph. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
