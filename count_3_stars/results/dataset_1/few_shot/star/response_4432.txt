Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a 3-star pattern. 

Examining the graph and adjacency list provided, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<1, (0, 5, 8)>
<4, (0, 7, 7)>
<9, (3, 6, 8)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we find that there are [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
