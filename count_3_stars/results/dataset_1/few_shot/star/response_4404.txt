Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 7) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 1
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. These instances represent 3-stars. 

Looking at the provided edges and adjacency list, we can identify the 3-star configurations in the graph:

<1, (2, 3, 7)>  
<2, (1, 4, 6)>  
<7, (1, 2, 5)>  

[The number of 3-stars in the graph is 3.]
