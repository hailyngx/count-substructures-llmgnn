Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<2, (1, 4, 8)>
