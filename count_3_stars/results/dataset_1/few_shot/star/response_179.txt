Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars present.

Given the definition of a 3-star graph, we know that each 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes. We can find these by looking at each node and its neighbors to see if it forms a 3-star. 

Let's identify the 3-stars:
1. Node 0: (0, 1, 4, 5), (0, 1, 5, 6), (0, 1, 5, 7)
2. Node 1: (1, 0, 5, 8), (1, 5, 8, 9)
3. Node 4: (4, 0, 3, 6), (4, 0, 6, 7)
4. Node 5: (5, 0, 3, 6), (5, 0, 6, 7)
5. Node 6: (6, 0, 4, 7), (6, 0, 5, 7), (6, 0, 7, 9)
6. Node 7: (7, 0, 4, 6), (7, 0, 5, 6), (7, 0, 6, 9)
7. Node 8: (8, 1, 5, 7), (8, 1, 7, 9)
8. Node 9: (9, 1, 6, 8)

Therefore, there are a total of [14] unique 3-stars present in the given graph.
