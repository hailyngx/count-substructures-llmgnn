Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 4, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we look for each node that forms a 3-star around it. A 3-star is formed when a node (center) is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph and count them.

The 3-stars in the given graph are:
<0, (3, 7, 1)>
<1, (3, 4, 9)>
<2, (4, 5, 6)>
<3, (0, 1, 6)>
<4, (1, 2, 5)>
<5, (2, 4, 9)>
<6, (2, 3, 4)>
<7, (0, 3, 5)>
<8, (4, 5, 4)>
<9, (1, 3, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [10].
