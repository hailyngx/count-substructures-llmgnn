Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern.

Starting with the adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars:
- <1, (3, 7)>
- <2, (3, 5)>
- <3, (1, 2, 4)>
- <3, (1, 2, 6)>
- <3, (1, 4, 9)>
- <3, (2, 4, 6)>
- <3, (2, 4, 9)>
- <4, (3, 5, 6)>
- <4, (3, 5, 9)>
- <8, (5, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
