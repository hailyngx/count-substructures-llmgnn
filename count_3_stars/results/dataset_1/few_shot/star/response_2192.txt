Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 3

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Looking at the adjacency list, the possible 3-star configurations involve the following nodes as centers:

- Node 0: (3, 4, 5)
- Node 2: (7, 8, 4)
- Node 4: (0, 5, 6), (5, 6, 8)
- Node 5: (0, 1, 4), (4, 6, 8)

Let's count the number of unique 3-stars:
- <0, (3, 4, 5)>
- <2, (7, 8, 4)>
- <4, (0, 5, 6)>
- <4, (5, 6, 8)>
- <5, (0, 1, 4)>
- <5, (4, 6, 8)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
