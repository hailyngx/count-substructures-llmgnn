Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 6

Response:
Starting with Node 0:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 7. Hence, <0, (4, 5, 7)> is a 3-star.

Moving on to Node 1:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2 and 3. However, we don't have any 3-star pattern originating from Node 1.

Next, Node 2:
- Node 2 is connected to Node 1, but no 3-star configuration is present.

Now, Node 3:
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 5, 8, and 9. There are two 3-stars: 
    <3, (1, 4, 5)>
    <3, (8, 9, 6)>

Proceeding with Node 4:
- Node 4 is connected to Node 0 and Node 3, but no new 3-star is present.

Considering Node 5:
- Node 5 is connected to Node 0 and Node 3, but no additional 3-star is identified.

Moving on to Node 6:
- Node 6 is connected to Node 9, forming a 3-star: <6, (9, 3, 1)>.

Moving to Node 7:
- Node 7 is connected to Node 0, but no 3-star pattern is found.

Next, Node 8:
- Node 8 is connected to Node 3, but no 3-star configuration is observed.

Finally, Node 9:
- Node 9 is connected to Node 3 and Node 6, but no new 3-star is identified.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4]. The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 5, 7)>
<3, (1, 4, 5)>
<3, (8, 9, 6)>
<6, (9, 3, 1)>
