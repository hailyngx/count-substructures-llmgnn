Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (7, 4) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 4
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 3

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have exactly three neighbors, as these can potentially form 3-star graphs. Nodes 0, 3, and 4 meet this criteria.

Now, let's examine each of these nodes and their neighbors to see if they form 3-star graphs:
1. Node 0: <0, (1, 2, 3)>, <0, (1, 4, 5)>
2. Node 3: <3, (0, 1, 5)>, <3, (0, 4, 9)>, <3, (1, 5, 9)>
3. Node 4: <4, (0, 5, 7)>

Counting the unique 3-stars found, we have <0, (1, 2, 3)>, <0, (1, 4, 5)>, <3, (0, 1, 5)>, <3, (0, 4, 9)>, <3, (1, 5, 9)>, and <4, (0, 5, 7)>. 
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
