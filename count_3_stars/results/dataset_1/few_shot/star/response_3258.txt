Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (8, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 1
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, letâ€™s first identify the 3-star configurations:

1. Node 0 can form a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, and 4: <0, (1, 3, 4)>
2. Node 1 can form a 3-star with nodes 0, 6, and 8: <1, (0, 6, 8)>
3. Node 3 can form a 3-star with nodes 0, 4, and 6: <3, (0, 4, 6)>
4. Node 4 can form a 3-star with nodes 0, 3, and 6: <4, (0, 3, 6)>

Count of 3-stars: [4]

Therefore, there are 4 3-stars in the given graph.
