Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 5

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

The possible 3-stars in this graph can be represented by the following combinations of nodes:
1. (0, 4, 6)
2. (1, 3, 9)
3. (1, 6, 9)
4. (1, 8, 9)
5. (2, 4, 7)
6. (2, 4, 8)
7. (2, 7, 8)
8. (3, 8, 9)
9. (5, 8, 9)
10. (7, 4, 6)

Count of the 3-stars: [10]

Unique 3-stars: 
<0, (4, 6)>
<1, (3, 9)>
<1, (6, 9)>
<1, (8, 9)>
<2, (4, 7)>
<2, (4, 8)>
<2, (7, 8)>
<3, (8, 9)>
<5, (8, 9)>
<7, (4, 6)>
