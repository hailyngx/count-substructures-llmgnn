Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 6
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all the occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's first identify the 3-stars:

1. Node 1: (1, 7, 8)
2. Node 3: (3, 5, 6), (3, 6, 8)
3. Node 6: (6, 3, 8)

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph inside brackets [].
The answer is [3].

Unique 3-stars:
<1, (7, 8)>
<3, (5, 6, 8)>
<6, (3, 8)>
