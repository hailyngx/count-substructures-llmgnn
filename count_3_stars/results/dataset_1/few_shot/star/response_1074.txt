Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars present. A 3-star consists of a center node with exactly three other nodes connected to it.

Upon examining the adjacency list for each node and the provided edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<0, (1, 3, 6)>
<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<0, (1, 7, 9)>
<0, (2, 5, 6)>
<0, (2, 6, 8)>
<0, (2, 8, 3)>
<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<0, (3, 6, 8)>
<0, (3, 8, 9)>
<0, (6, 2, 5)>
<0, (6, 2, 8)>
<0, (6, 3, 5)>
<0, (6, 3, 8)>
<0, (6, 5, 9)>
<0, (7, 4, 9)>
<0, (7, 6, 9)>
<2, (5, 3, 6)>
<2, (5, 6, 9)>
<3, (5, 2, 6)>
<3, (5, 6, 9)>
<6, (2, 5, 3)>
<6, (2, 5, 9)>
<6, (3, 5, 9)>
<6, (5, 2, 9)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars:
