Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 3

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern. 

Based on the definition given, a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's analyze the graph:

Nodes with exactly three connections (leaves) are candidates for being the central node of a 3-star. These nodes are: node 0, node 6, and node 9.

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
1. For node 0:
   <0, (5, 6)>
   
2. For node 6:
   <6, (0, 2, 5)>
   
3. For node 9:
   <9, (3, )>
   
Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
