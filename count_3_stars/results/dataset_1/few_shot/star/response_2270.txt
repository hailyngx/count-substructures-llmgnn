Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (4, 2) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern where one node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the given graph, there are two 3-star patterns:
1. <1, (0, 6, 9)>
2. <9, (1, 5, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
