Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify these 3-stars step by step:

1. Nodes with exactly three neighbors:
   - Node 0: (0, 2, 9)
   - Node 1: (1, 5, 7)
   - Node 2: (2, 0, 4)
   - Node 5: (5, 1, 4)
   - Node 6: (6, 2, 4)
   - Node 8: (8, 1, 7)
   - Node 9: (9, 0, 4)

2. Combine the above results to identify the unique 3-stars:
   - <0, (2, 9)>
   - <1, (5, 7)>
   - <2, (0, 4)>
   - <4, (2, 5, 6)>
   - <7, (1, 8, 9)>
   - <9, (0, 4, 7)>

3. Count the total number of unique 3-stars: [6]

Therefore, the final answer is [6].
