Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 7

Response:
There are 7 unique 3-stars in this graph. 
The unique 3-stars are as follows:
<0, (3, 5, 8)>
<1, (2, 5, 7)>
<1, (5, 7, 9)>
<3, (0, 8, 9)>
<5, (0, 1, 7)>
<5, (1, 7, 8)>
<9, (1, 7, 6)>
