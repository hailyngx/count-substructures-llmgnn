Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the 3-stars present. 
Here are the 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (1, 3, 7)>
<1, (0, 2, 5)>
<2, (1, 3, 8)>
<3, (0, 2, 8)>
<4, (5, 6, 9)>
<5, (1, 4, 6)>
<6, (4, 5, 9)>
<7, (0)>
<8, (1, 2)>
<9, (6)>

Now, we count the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph by listing them above and enclosing the count in brackets. 
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
