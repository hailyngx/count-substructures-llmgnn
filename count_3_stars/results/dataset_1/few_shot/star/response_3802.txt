Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 3

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the possible 3-stars by looking for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes through edges.

Looking at the adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars:
1. <0, (2, 4, 7)>
2. <0, (4, 5, 7)>
3. <1, (7, 8, 9)>
4. <2, (0, 4, 7)>
5. <3, (7, 8, 9)>
6. <4, (0, 2, 5)>
7. <5, (0, 4, 6)>
8. <6, (5, 7, 8)>
9. <7, (0, 1, 2)>
10. <7, (3, 6, 8)>
11. <8, (6, 7, 9)>
12. <9, (1, 3, 8)>

Counting the unique 3-stars gives us a total of [12].
