Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 3

Response:
The center node for a 3-star graph must have degree 3, meaning it must be connected to exactly 3 other nodes. In this graph, only nodes 1, 2, 6, and 9 have degree 3. 

Let's analyze each of these nodes to find the 3-stars:
1. Node 1: Connected to nodes 5, 6, and 9. This forms a 3-star with node 1 as the center and nodes 5, 6, 9 as the leaves. <1, (5, 6, 9)>
2. Node 2: Connected to nodes 0, 5, 7, 8, and 9. This forms two 3-stars: <2, (0, 5, 7)> and <2, (8, 5, 9)>
3. Node 6: Connected to nodes 1, 3, and 5. This forms a 3-star with node 6 as the center and nodes 1, 3, 5 as the leaves. <6, (1, 3, 5)>
4. Node 9: Connected to nodes 1, 2, and 3. This forms a 3-star with node 9 as the center and nodes 1, 2, 3 as the leaves. <9, (1, 2, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
