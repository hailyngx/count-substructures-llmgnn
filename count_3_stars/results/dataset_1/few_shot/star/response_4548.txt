Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 5, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars present. 

Let's list the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (1, 6, 4)>
<1, (0, 2, 7)>
<1, (0, 7, 8)>
<1, (2, 7, 8)>
<1, (7, 8, 0)>
<1, (7, 8, 4)>
<2, (1, 4, 8)>
<4, (2, 6, 8)>
<7, (1, 3, 9)>
<7, (3, 9, 1)>
<8, (1, 4, 0)>
<8, (1, 4, 7)>

Count of 3-stars: [12]
