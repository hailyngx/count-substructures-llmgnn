Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 8

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern (central node connected to three leaves).

Let's list all unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (3, 7, 8)>
<0, (3, 7, 9)>
<0, (7, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 5, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 8)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph: [5].
