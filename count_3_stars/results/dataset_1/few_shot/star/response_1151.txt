Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 6) (3, 1) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 7

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 6, and the center (0): <0, (4, 6)>
2. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 5, 8, and the center (1): <1, (3, 5, 8)>
3. Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 2, 5, and the center (6): <6, (0, 2, 5)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
