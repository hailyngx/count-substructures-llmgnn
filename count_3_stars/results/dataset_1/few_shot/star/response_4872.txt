Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 6

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star structures in the given graph:

<0, (3, 1, 6)>
<1, (3, 9, 6)>
<3, (0, 1, 6)>
<6, (3, 8, 9)>

Now we count the total number of 3-stars: [4].
