Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, 7, and node 8

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique configurations where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list all the 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (1, 8, 9)>
<1, (0, 8, 9)>
<3, (1, 4, 5)>
<4, (0, 1, 3)>
<5, (0, 1, 3)>
<6, (3, 9, 7)>
<7, (1, 9, 6)>
<8, (0, 1, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 8)>

Count the total number of 3-stars: [9].
