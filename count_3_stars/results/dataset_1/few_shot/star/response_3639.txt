Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 6

Response:
To find all the 3-star graphs in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify and list them:

1. Node 3: (3, 0), (3, 4), (3, 7), (3, 9) <3, (0, 4, 7)>
2. Node 4: (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 8) <4, (2, 3, 5)>
3. Node 6: (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 7), (6, 9) <6, (0, 2, 7)>
4. Node 9: (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 6) <9, (1, 2, 3)>

Thus, there are 3 unique 3-star graphs found in the given graph. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [3].
