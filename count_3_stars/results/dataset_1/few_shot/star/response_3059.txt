Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern.

Analyzing the graph based on the provided information, we can determine the 3-stars in the graph:
1. <0, (1, 6, 7)>
2. <2, (1, 7, 8)>
3. <8, (0, 2, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
<0, (1, 6, 7)> <2, (1, 7, 8)> <8, (0, 2, 9)>
