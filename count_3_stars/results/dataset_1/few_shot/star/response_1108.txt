Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 3

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are: 

<0, (3, 8, 9)>
<2, (3, 5, 6)>

Therefore, there are [2] 3-stars in the given graph.
