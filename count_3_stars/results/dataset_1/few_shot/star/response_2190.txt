Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that has exactly 3 neighbors (edges), indicating the presence of a 3-star with that node as the center.

From the adjacency list provided:
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors

Nodes 0, 6, and 8 have 5 neighbors each, which means they form 3-stars. Let's list them:
<0, (6, 7, 9)>
<6, (0, 1, 4)>
<8, (1, 3, 4)>
<8, (4, 6, 7)>
<8, (6, 1, 4)>
<8, (6, 7, 9)>
<1, (6, 8, _)>
<4, (6, 8, _)>
<7, (8, 9, _)>

Total number of 3-stars: [9]
