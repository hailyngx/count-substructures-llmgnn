Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the 3-stars by finding the central node and its three connected nodes. 

Let's start by listing all the possible 3-stars:

<0, (1, 4, 7)>
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<2, (1, 3, 6)>
<3, (1, 2, 4)>
<4, (0, 3,7)>
<5, (6, 7, 9)>
<6, (2, 5, 7)>
<7, (0, 3, 5)>
<9, (5, 6, 7)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph:

[9]
