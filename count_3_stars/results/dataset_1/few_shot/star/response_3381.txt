Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 3

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can identify them by finding nodes that have exactly three neighbors and then observing if those neighbors are connected to each other.

Here are the steps to find the 3-stars:

1. Identify nodes with exactly three neighbors:
   - Node 0 has 2 neighbors.
   - Node 1 has 5 neighbors.
   - Node 2 has 3 neighbors.
   - Node 3 has 3 neighbors.
   - Node 4 has 4 neighbors.
   - Node 5 has 4 neighbors.
   - Node 6 has 3 neighbors.
   - Node 7 has 4 neighbors.
   - Node 8 has 2 neighbors.
   - Node 9 has 2 neighbors.

2. Check if the three neighbors of a node are connected to each other to form a 3-star.

Following the steps above, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- <1, (2, 5, 7)>
- <4, (1, 3, 7)>
- <7, (1, 4, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
