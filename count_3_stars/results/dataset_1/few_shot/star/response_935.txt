Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 4

Response:
The 3-star graph consists of one central node and three leaves connected to the central node. Let's find all the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. For Node 2:
   - <2, (5, 4, 8)>

2. For Node 3:
   - <3, (4, 6, 7)>
   
3. For Node 4:
   - <4, (3, 5, 8)>
   - <4, (5, 3, 9)>

4. For Node 5:
   - <5, (2, 4, 7)>
   
5. For Node 6:
   - <6, (0, 3, _)>

6. For Node 7:
   - <7, (3, 5, _)>

7. For Node 8:
   - <8, (2, 4, _)>

Overall, there are 7 unique 3-stars in the given graph. So, the final answer is [7].
