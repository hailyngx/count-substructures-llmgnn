Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, and node 5

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we find that nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9 are connected to multiple other nodes. 
We observe that there are no 3-stars involving nodes 6, as it's only connected to nodes 4 and 5. 

Now let's analyze each potential center node with its connected nodes to see if they form a 3-star:
1. Node 0: (0, 3, 9) - Forms a 3-star <0, (3, 9)>
2. Node 1: (1, 5, 9) - Forms a 3-star <1, (5, 9)>
3. Node 2: (2, 5, 9) - Forms a 3-star <2, (5, 9)>
4. Node 3: (3, 0, 4, 7, 9) - Forms two 3-stars <3, (0, 9)> and <3, (4, 7)>
5. Node 4: (4, 3, 5, 6, 8) - Forms three 3-stars <4, (3, 5)>, <4, (3, 8)>, and <4, (5, 6)>
6. Node 5: (5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 9) - Forms four 3-stars <5, (1, 9)>, <5, (2, 9)>, <5, (4, 6)>, and <5, (4, 9)>
7. Node 7: (7, 3, 8) - Forms a 3-star <7, (3, 8)>
8. Node 8: (8, 4, 7) - Forms a 3-star <8, (4, 7)>
9. Node 9: (9, 0, 1, 2, 3, 5) - Forms five 3-stars <9, (0, 1)>, <9, (0, 2)>, <9, (0, 3)>, <9, (1, 2)>, and <9, (1, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 15. 
So the final answer is [15].
The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (3, 9)>, 
<1, (5, 9)>, 
<2, (5, 9)>, 
<3, (0, 9)>, 
<3, (4, 7)>, 
<4, (3, 5)>, 
<4, (3, 8)>, 
<4, (5, 6)>, 
<5, (1, 9)>, 
<5, (2, 9)>, 
<5, (4, 6)>, 
<5, (4, 9)>, 
<7, (3, 8)>, 
<8, (4, 7)>, 
<9, (0, 1)>, 
<9, (0, 2)>, 
<9, (0, 3)>, 
<9, (1, 2)>, 
<9, (1, 5)>.
