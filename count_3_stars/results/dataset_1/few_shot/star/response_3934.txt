Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's analyze the graph based on the provided information:

Node 0: Not a central node for a 3-star.
Node 1: Connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, 6, 8. Forms a 3-star with nodes (0, 7), (3, 7), and (6, 7).
Node 2: Not a central node for a 3-star.
Node 3: Connected to nodes 1, 7. Forms a 3-star with nodes (1, 4, 6) as a leaf.
Node 4: Connected to nodes 1, 6. Forms a 3-star with nodes (1, 6, 7) as a leaf.
Node 5: Not a central node for a 3-star.
Node 6: Connected to nodes 1, 4, 7, 9. Forms a 3-star with nodes (1, 6, 9) as a leaf.
Node 7: Connected to nodes 0, 3, 6. Forms a 3-star with nodes (0, 1, 6) as a leaf.
Node 8: Not a central node for a 3-star.
Node 9: Not a central node for a 3-star.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are:
<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<1, (0, 7, 6)>
<3, (1, 4, 6)>
<4, (1, 6, 7)>

There are [4] 3-stars in the graph.
