Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 6, and node 7

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes of the 3-stars in the graph. The central nodes of the 3-stars will be the nodes with exactly three neighbors.

Based on the adjacency list:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors.

Now, let's look for the 3-stars:
- Node 3 is the center of the 3-star connecting nodes 1, 7, and 9. <3, (1, 7, 9)>
- Node 6 is the center of the 3-star connecting nodes 4, 7, and 9. <6, (4, 7, 9)>

Therefore, there are [2] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
