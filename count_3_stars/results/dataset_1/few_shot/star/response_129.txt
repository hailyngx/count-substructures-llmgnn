Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars present in the graph:
<0, (1, 3, 8)>
<3, (0, 2, 8)>
<3, (0, 4, 5)>
<3, (4, 5, 8)>
<4, (3, 6, 8)>
<6, (4, 5, 9)>
<8, (0, 4, 9)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars: 
[7]
