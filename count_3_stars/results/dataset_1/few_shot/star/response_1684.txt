Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all unique 3-stars.

Starting with the definition of a 3-star graph, for each node in the graph, we need to check if it is connected to exactly three other nodes. If it is, then we have a 3-star with that node as the center and the three connected nodes as its leaves.

Let's list the unique 3-stars below:
<0, (2, 3, 5)>
<2, (0, 3, 5)>
<3, (0, 5, 4)>
<4, (1, 5, 6)>
<5, (3, 4, 7)>
<6, (4, 7, 9)>
<7, (5, 6, 8)>
<8, (6, 7, 9)>
<9, (5, 6, 8)>

Now, we count the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph:
[9]
