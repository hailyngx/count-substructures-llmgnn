Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 4

Response:
First, let's find all the 3-stars in the given graph.

The central node of a 3-star must be connected to exactly 3 other nodes. Let's identify those nodes:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 4 (3 stars: <0, (2, 3, 4)>)
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 6, and 8 (3 stars: <1, (2, 6, 8)>)
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, 8, and 9, but none of them form a 3-star.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 8 (no 3-star).
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 5, 8, and 9 (3 stars: <4, (0, 2, 5)> and <4, (0, 2, 9)>)
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 4 and 8 (no 3-star).
- Node 6 is connected to node 1 (no 3-star).
- Node 7 is connected to node 8 (no 3-star).
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7, but none of them form a 3-star.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2 and 4 (no 3-star).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (2, 3, 4)>, <1, (2, 6, 8)>, <4, (0, 2, 5)>, and <4, (0, 2, 9)>.
