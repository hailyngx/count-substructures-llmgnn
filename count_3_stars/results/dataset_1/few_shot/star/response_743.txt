Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star pattern.

Looking at the information provided and the definition of a 3-star graph, we can see that nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, 8 are potential central nodes for 3-stars since they are connected to exactly three other nodes.

Starting with node 0:
Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 5. This forms a 3-star:
<0, (2, 4, 5)>

Moving on to node 1:
Node 1 is connected to nodes 7 and 8. Since it is not connected to exactly three nodes, it does not form a 3-star.

Next, node 3:
Node 3 is connected to nodes 7 and 9. Since it is not connected to exactly three nodes, it does not form a 3-star.

Moving on to node 4:
Node 4 is connected to nodes 0 and 8. Since it is not connected to exactly three nodes, it does not form a 3-star.

Lastly, node 8:
Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 9. This forms a 3-star:
<8, (1, 4, 9)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is 2.
