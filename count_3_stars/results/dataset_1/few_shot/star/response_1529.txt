Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern.

First, let's list out the 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<0, (1, 7, 8)>
<0, (1, 8, 9)>
<2, (0, 1, 4)>
<2, (1, 0, 4)>
<2, (1, 3, 4)>
<2, (1, 4, 7)>
<2, (0, 4, 3)>
<2, (0, 4, 7)>
<3, (0, 1, 4)>
<3, (0, 1, 4)>
<3, (1, 2, 4)>
<3, (1, 4, 7)>
<3, (1, 4, 7)>
<4, (2, 0, 3)>
<4, (0, 2, 3)>
<4, (0, 3, 7)>
<4, (0, 7, 6)>
<4, (2, 3, 7)>
<4, (3, 7, 6)>
<6, (4, 7, 8)>
<6, (4, 7, 0)>
<7, (0, 1, 4)>
<7, (0, 1, 4)>
<7, (1, 2, 4)>
<7, (1, 4, 3)>
<8, (0, 1, 6)>
<8, (0, 6, 9)>
<8, (1, 0, 6)>
<8, (1, 6, 9)>
<8, (1, 6, 4)>
<8, (6, 4, 7)>
<9, (0, 1, 8)>
<9, (1, 0, 8)>

Count of 3-stars: [9]
