Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 5

Response:
First, let's find the nodes that are the center of a 3-star, which means they have exactly 3 neighbors. 
Based on the given adjacency list:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 1 neighbor
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 1 neighbor
- Node 7 has 1 neighbor
- Node 8 has 1 neighbor
- Node 9 has 1 neighbor

Therefore, the center nodes of the 3-stars are nodes 3, 6, 7, 8, and 9.

Next, we identify the leaves of each 3-star connected to each center node:
- For node 3: (0, 2, 5)
- For node 6: (7)
- For node 7: (6)
- For node 8: (4)
- For node 9: (5)

So, the unique 3-stars found in the given graph are: 
<3, (0, 2, 5)>
<6, (7)>
<7, (6)>
<8, (4)>
<9, (5)>

Count of 3-stars: [5]
