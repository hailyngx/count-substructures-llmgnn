Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 9
