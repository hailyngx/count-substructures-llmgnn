Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 4, and 5 <0, (3, 4, 5)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 5, and 8 <2, (4, 5, 8)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 6, and 8 <3, (0, 6, 8)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, and 2 <4, (0, 1, 2)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 2, and 7 <5, (0, 2, 7)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, and 8 <6, (1, 3, 8)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 3, and 5 <8, (2, 3, 5)>

Counting the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph, we get a total of [7]. 

Therefore, the final answer is [7].
