Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 5, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars present. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Given the adjacency list and edges provided, we can count the number of 3-stars by examining each node and its connections. 

Here are the unique 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<0, (3, 4, 8)>
<0, (4, 8, 9)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<2, (4, 6, 5)>
<3, (0, 1, 6)>
<3, (1, 4, 9)>
<3, (4, 6, 9)>
<5, (4, 7, 9)>
<7, (3, 5, 9)>
<7, (5, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 5, 7)>
<9, (0, 4, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [13].
