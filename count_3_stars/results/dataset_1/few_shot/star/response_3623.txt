Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 4
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 4

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

```
Node 0: 1, 2, 8
Node 1: 0, 6
Node 2: 0, 3, 4, 8
Node 3: 2, 6, 9
Node 4: 2, 6, 8, 9
Node 5: 
Node 6: 1, 3, 4
Node 7: 
Node 8: 0, 2, 4
Node 9: 3, 4
```

Let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph. 
We can see that the possible 3-stars would involve nodes with exactly 3 connections. 
Let's determine the 3-stars:
1. Node 0 - (1, 2, 8)
2. Node 2 - (0, 3, 8)
3. Node 2 - (0, 4, 8)
4. Node 4 - (2, 6 ,8)
5. Node 4 - (2, 6 ,9)

Therefore, there are a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars are:

<0, (1, 2, 8)>
<2, (0, 3, 8)>
<2, (0, 4, 8)>
<4, (2, 6, 8)>
<4, (2, 6, 9)>
