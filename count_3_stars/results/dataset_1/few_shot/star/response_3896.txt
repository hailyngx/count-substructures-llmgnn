Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 6

Response:
The central node of each 3-star will be the node with degree 3, as it is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify these central nodes first:

Central nodes: 2, 3, 6

Now, we can find the 3-stars by determining the adjacent nodes for each central node:
<2, (1, 5, 6)>
<3, (1, 6, 7)>
<6, (2, 3, 4)>

Therefore, there are [3] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
