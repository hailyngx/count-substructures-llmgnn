Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Based on the given information, the 3-stars in the graph are as follows:
<0, (2, 5, 7)>
<3, (1, 2, 7)>
<3, (2, 7, 8)>
<3, (7, 8, 4)>
<7, (0, 3, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
