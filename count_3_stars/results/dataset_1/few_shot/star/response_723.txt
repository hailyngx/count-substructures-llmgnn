Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star structure.

Given the adjacency list and the edges provided, we can identify the 3-stars by looking for nodes with exactly 3 neighbors. Let's go through each node:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors (1, 5, 8, 9)
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 3 has 1 neighbor
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

Nodes 1, 3, 7, and 8 do not form 3-stars directly. Nodes 0, 2, 4, 5, and 9 have the potential to form 3-stars.

Let's identify the 3-stars:
- <0, (1, 5, 8)>
- <0, (1, 5, 9)>
- <0, (1, 8, 9)>
- <0, (5, 8, 9)>
- <2, (3, 6, 9)>
- <4, (7, 8, 9)>
- <4, (7, 5, 9)>
- <4, (7, 5, 9)>
- <5, (6, 0, 7)>
- <5, (6, 7, 9)>
- <9, (0, 2, 4)>
- <9, (0, 4, 6)>
- <9, (2, 4, 6)>
- <9, (0, 2, 6)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
