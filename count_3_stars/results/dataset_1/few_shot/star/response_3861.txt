Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, and node 9

Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star pattern in the graph. 

Starting from each node, we will check if it forms a 3-star with exactly three other nodes. If a node is connected to exactly three other nodes and those three nodes are not connected to each other, we have found a 3-star.

Let's go through each node to identify the 3-stars:
1. Node 0 is not part of any 3-star.
2. Node 1 forms a 3-star <1, (0, 3, 9)>
3. Node 2 is not part of any 3-star.
4. Node 3 forms a 3-star <3, (1, 8, 9)>
5. Node 4 forms two 3-stars <4, (1, 3, 8)> and <4, (2, 5, 6)>
6. Node 5 is not part of any 3-star.
7. Node 6 is not part of any 3-star.
8. Node 7 is not part of any 3-star.
9. Node 8 forms a 3-star <8, (1, 3, 7)>
10. Node 9 is not part of any 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

Unique 3-stars:
<1, (0, 3, 9)>
<3, (1, 8, 9)>
<4, (1, 3, 8)>
<4, (2, 5, 6)>
