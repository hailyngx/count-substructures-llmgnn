Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 6
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 6

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. 3-star centered at node 2: <2, (0, 1, 7)>
2. 3-star centered at node 6: <6, (3, 7, 9)>

[Number of 3-stars: 2]
