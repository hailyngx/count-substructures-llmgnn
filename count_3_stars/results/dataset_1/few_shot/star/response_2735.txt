Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 9) (4, 1) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through each node to identify the 3-stars:

1. Node 0: Not a 3-star node.
2. Node 1: Not a 3-star node.
3. Node 2: Not a 3-star node.
4. Node 3: Not connected to any other nodes.
5. Node 4: Not a 3-star node.
6. Node 5: Not a 3-star node.
7. Node 6: <6, (7, 9, 0)>.
8. Node 7: Not a 3-star node.
9. Node 8: Not a 3-star node.
10. Node 9: <9, (6, 0, 2)>.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
<6, (7, 9, 0)>, <9, (6, 0, 2)>
