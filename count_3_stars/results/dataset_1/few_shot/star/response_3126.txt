Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify all unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star pattern.

Let's analyze the graph step-by-step:

For each node:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 7, 8, and 9. This forms the 3-stars <0, (3, 7, 8)> and <0, (3, 8, 9)>.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 4 and 7. This forms the 3-star <1, (4, 7, -)>.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 6 and 7. This forms the 3-star <2, (6, 7, -)>.
- Node 3 is connected to node 0. No 3-star for this node.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 5. This forms the 3-stars <4, (0, 1, 5)>.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 4 and 9. This forms the 3-star <5, (4, 9, -)>.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 2 and 7. This forms the 3-star <6, (2, 7, -)>.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, and 6. This forms the 3-stars <7, (0, 1, 2)> and <7, (0, 1, 6)>.
- Node 8 is connected to node 0. No 3-star for this node.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0 and 5. No 3-star for this node.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].

<0, (3, 7, 8)>, <0, (3, 8, 9)>, <1, (4, 7, -)>, <4, (0, 1, 5)>, <7, (0, 1, 2)>
