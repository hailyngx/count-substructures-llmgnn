Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 6, and node 8

Response:
Let's first identify the 3-star subgraphs in the given graph. 

In a 3-star graph, the central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 
Looking at the given connections, we can identify the following 3-stars:
1. Central node: 0, Leaves: 2, 5, 8
2. Central node: 2, Leaves: 0, 1, 8
3. Central node: 3, Leaves: 2, 7, 8
4. Central node: 4, Leaves: 6, 8
5. Central node: 5, Leaves: 0, 7
6. Central node: 6, Leaves: 4, 9
7. Central node: 7, Leaves: 3, 5, 8
8. Central node: 8, Leaves: 0, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9
9. Central node: 9, Leaves: 6, 8

Counting the number of 3-stars identified: [9]

Unique 3-stars found: 
<0, (2, 5, 8)>
<2, (0, 1, 8)>
<3, (2, 7, 8)>
<4, (6, 8)>
<5, (0, 7)>
<6, (4, 9)>
<7, (3, 5, 8)>
<8, (0, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9)>
<9, (6, 8)> [9]
