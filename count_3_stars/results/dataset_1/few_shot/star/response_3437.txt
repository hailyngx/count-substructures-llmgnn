Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a 3-star pattern.

From the adjacency list, we can observe that the nodes connected to exactly three other nodes include nodes 1, 2, 5, and 7. Let's identify the 3-stars involving these nodes:

- For node 1: (1, (3, 5, 6)), (1, (3, 6, 7))
- For node 2: (2, (4, 6, 7)), (2, (4, 7, 9)), (2, (6, 7, 9))
- For node 5: (5, (1, 7, 3)), (5, (7, 1, 5))
- For node 7: (7, (1, 3, 6)), (7, (1, 5, 7)), (7, (2, 4, 7))

Therefore, there are a total of [7] 3-stars in the given graph. 

<1, (3, 5, 6)>, <1, (3, 6, 7)>, <2, (4, 6, 7)>, <2, (4, 7, 9)>, <2, (6, 7, 9)>, <5, (1, 7, 3)>, <7, (1, 3, 6)>.
