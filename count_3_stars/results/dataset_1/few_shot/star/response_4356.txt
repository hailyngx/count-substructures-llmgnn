Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

From the given adjacency list, we can identify the 3-stars as follows:

<2, (1, 7, 4)>
<5, (1, 7, 8)>
<7, (2, 3, 5)>
