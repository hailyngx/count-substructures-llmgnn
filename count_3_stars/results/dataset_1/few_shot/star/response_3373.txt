Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars.

Based on the definition of a 3-star graph, we need to find all instances where a node is directly connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list the unique 3-stars found:

1. <0, (2, 4, 1)>
2. <1, (4, 9, 0)>
3. <3, (4, 8, 9)>
4. <5, (4, 8, 9)>
5. <6, (4, 7, 0)>
6. <7, (4, 6, 0)>
7. <8, (3, 4, 5)>
8. <9, (1, 3, 5)>

Now, we count the total number of unique 3-stars found. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
