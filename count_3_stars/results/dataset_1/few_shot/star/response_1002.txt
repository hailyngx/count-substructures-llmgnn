Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the adjacency list provided, we can identify the following 3-stars:

<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<0, (3, 4, 8)>
<1, (5, 6, 8)>
<1, (6, 7, 8)>
<3, (6, 7, 9)>
<4, (7, 9, 0)>
<5, (8, 9, 1)>
<9, (8, 5, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].  
In brackets: [8]
