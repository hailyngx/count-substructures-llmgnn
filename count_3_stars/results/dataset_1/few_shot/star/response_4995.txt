Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 8

Response:
Given the graph, we can identify the 3-star structures by looking for nodes that have exactly 3 edges.

The nodes with 3 edges are as follows:
- Node 1: Connected to nodes 2, 5
- Node 3: Connected to node 0
- Node 4: Connected to node 0
- Node 6: Connected to nodes 5, 7
- Node 8: Connected to nodes 2, 9

Let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph.
