Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 8

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be calculated by counting the number of times a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Based on the given information, the 3-stars in the graph are as follows:
<[1, (3, 4, 5)]>
<[4, (1, 2, 6)]>
<[8, (1, 6, 9)]>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
