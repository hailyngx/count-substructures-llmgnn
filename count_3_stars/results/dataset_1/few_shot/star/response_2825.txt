Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 8

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. For Node 0:
   - Possible 3-star: <0, (1, 8), (1, 8)> 

2. For Node 1:
   - Possible 3-star: <1, (0, 3), (0, 3)> 

3. For Node 2:
   - No possible 3-star as it has only 2 edges. 

4. For Node 3:
   - Possible 3-star: <3, (1, 4, 5), (1, 4, 5)>

5. For Node 4:
   - No possible 3-star as it has only 2 edges. 

6. For Node 5:
   - No possible 3-star as it has only 1 edge. 

7. For Node 6:
   - No possible 3-star as it has only 3 edges. 

8. For Node 7:
   - No possible 3-star as it has only 1 edge. 

9. For Node 8:
   - No possible 3-star as it has only 3 edges. 

10. For Node 9:
   - No possible 3-star as it has only 3 edges. 

Therefore, there are [1] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
