Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 7

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern.

Counting the 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 8, and 9 <1, (4, 8, 9)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 5, and 9 <2, (4, 5, 9)>

[The total number of 3-stars is 2.]
