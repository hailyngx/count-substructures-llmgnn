Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 4, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Based on the adjacency list provided, we can identify the following 3-stars:

<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<1, (0, 5, 9)>
<2, (8, 9, 6)>
<3, (5, 6, 9)>
<4, (0, 6, 9)>
<5, (1, 3, 6)>
<6, (3, 4, 7)>
<7, (3, 6, 9)>
<8, (2, 6, 9)>
<9, (1, 3, 6)>

Counting these unique 3-stars, we have a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
