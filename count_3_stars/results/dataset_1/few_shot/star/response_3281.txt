Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 7

Response:
Since a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can start by identifying the nodes that have exactly three neighbors. These nodes could potentially be the central node of 3-stars.

From the given adjacency list, we can see that nodes 1, 3, and 9 have only one neighbor each, so they cannot be central nodes of 3-stars.

Nodes 0, 5 have two neighbors each, so they also cannot be central nodes of 3-stars.

Nodes 7 and 4 have four neighbors each, so they don't fit the criteria.

Nodes 2 and 6 have five neighbors each, making them possible central nodes for 3-stars.

Node 8 has three neighbors, making it a candidate for a central node of a 3-star.

Let's check which configurations can form a 3-star around nodes 2, 6, and 8. 

For node 2: (2, 1, 4, 6), (2, 3, 6, 8), (2, 4, 7, 8)
For node 6: (6, 2, 5, 8)
For node 8: (8, 2, 5, 6)

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<2, (1, 4, 6)>
<2, (3, 6, 8)>
<2, (4, 7, 8)>
<6, (2, 5, 8)>
<8, (2, 5, 6)>
