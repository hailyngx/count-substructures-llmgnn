Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 5) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (9, 1) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Based on the given graph, the 3-stars are as follows:
<[1, (6, 9, 7)]>
<[5, (3, 6, 7)]>
<[7, (0, 4, 5)]>
<[9, (1, 7, 1)]>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
