Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars, we need to identify all possible configurations where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through the graph to find and count these 3-stars.

The candidates for central nodes are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

For each central node, we will list the connected nodes:

1. <0, (1, 4, 5)>
2. <1, (0, 2, 5)>
3. <2, (1, 3, 7)>
4. <3, (2, 7)>
5. <4, (0, 7, 8)>
6. <5, (0, 1)>
7. <6, (8, 9)>
8. <7, (2, 3, 4)>
9. <8, (1, 4, 6)>
10. <9, (6, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
