Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify nodes that can act as the center of a 3-star. In this case, any node with exactly three neighbors can be a center. 

Let's identify the nodes with 3 neighbors:
- Node 0: 4 neighbors
- Node 1: 1 neighbor
- Node 2: 4 neighbors
- Node 3: 4 neighbors
- Node 4: 2 neighbors
- Node 5: 1 neighbor
- Node 6: 3 neighbors
- Node 7: 4 neighbors
- Node 8: 3 neighbors
- Node 9: 2 neighbors

Nodes 6 and 8 are the only nodes with exactly 3 neighbors, so they can act as centers of 3-stars. 

Now, let's find the unique 3-stars in the graph:
<6, (2, 3, 9)>
<8, (0, 4, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
