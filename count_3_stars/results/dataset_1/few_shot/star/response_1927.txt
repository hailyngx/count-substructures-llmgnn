Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 8

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star clusters in the given graph step by step:

1. Identify nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 1: Connected to nodes 0, 4, and 8
- Node 3: Connected to nodes 2, 7, and 8
- Node 4: Connected to nodes 1, 6, and 8
- Node 5: Connected to nodes 6, 7, and 8
- Node 6: Connected to nodes 4, 5, and 8
- Node 7: Connected to nodes 3, 4, and 5

2. For each of these nodes, check if the nodes they are connected to form a 3-star pattern. This means one node (center) is connected to exactly three other nodes (leaves).
- For Node 1: (0, 4, 8) is a 3-star
- For Node 3: (2, 7, 8) is a 3-star
- For Node 4: (1, 6, 8) is a 3-star
- For Node 5: (6, 7, 8) is a 3-star
- For Node 6: (4, 5, 8) is a 3-star
- For Node 7: (3, 4, 5) is a 3-star

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are:
<1, (0, 4, 8)>, <3, (2, 7, 8)>, <4, (1, 6, 8)>, <5, (6, 7, 8)>, <6, (4, 5, 8)>, <7, (3, 4, 5)>

There are a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
