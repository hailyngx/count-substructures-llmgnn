Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 7) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 7
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 7, and node 8

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0: <0, (2, 7, 8)>
2. Node 1: <1, (5, 6, 7)>
3. Node 2: <2, (0, 7, 8)>
4. Node 7: <7, (0, 2, 3)>
5. Node 8: <8, (0, 7, 9)>
6. Node 9: <9, (7, 8, -)>

Count of 3-stars: [6]
