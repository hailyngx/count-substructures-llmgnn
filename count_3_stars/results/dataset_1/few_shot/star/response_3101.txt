Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 4, and 8: <0, (3, 4, 8)>
2. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 8, and 9: <1, (2, 8, 9)>
3. Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 6, and 7: <2, (1, 6, 7)>
4. Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 4, and 8: <3, (0, 4, 8)>
5. Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 8, and 9: <7, (0, 8, 9)>

Therefore, there are a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
