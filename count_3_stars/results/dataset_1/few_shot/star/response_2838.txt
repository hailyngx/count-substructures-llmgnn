Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 5

Response:
Given the graph information, let's identify the 3-stars:

1. Starting with the central node 0:
    - <0, (5, 8, NA)>
    - <0, (8, 5, NA)>

2. Moving on to the central node 1:
    - <1, (2, NA, NA)>
    
3. Analyzing the central node 2:
    - <2, (1, 3, 8)>
    - <2, (1, 9, 8)>
    - <2, (3, 1, 8)>
    - <2, (3, 7, 9)>
    - <2, (7, 3, 6)>
    - <2, (7, 6, 3)>
    - <2, (8, 1, 9)>
    - <2, (8, 9, 1)>
    - <2, (9, 1, 8)>
    - <2, (9, 8, 1)>

4. Considering the central node 3:
    - <3, (2, 5, 9)>
    - <3, (2, 9, 5)>
    - <3, (5, 2, 9)>
    - <3, (5, 6, 9)>
    - <3, (6, 5, 9)>
    - <3, (6, 7, 2)>
    - <3, (6, 9, 5)>
    - <3, (7, 6, 2)>
    - <3, (9, 2, 5)>
    - <3, (9, 5, 6)>
    - <3, (9, 6, 5)>

5. Exploring the central node 5:
    - <5, (0, 3, 9)>
    - <5, (0, 6, 9)>
    - <5, (3, 0, 9)>
    - <5, (3, 6, 9)>
    - <5, (6, 0, 9)>
    - <5, (6, 3, 9)>
    - <5, (9, 0, 3)>
    - <5, (9, 3, 6)>
    - <5, (9, 6, 0)>

6. Finally, investigating the central node 9:
    - <9, (2, 3, 5)>
    - <9, (2, 5, 3)>
    - <9, (3, 2, 5)>
    - <9, (3, 5, 6)>
    - <9, (4, 5, NA)>
    - <9, (4, NA, 5)>
    - <9, (5, 2, 3)>
    - <9, (5, 3, 6)>
    - <9, (5, 4, NA)>
    - <9, (5, 9, 0)>
    - <9, (6, 3, 5)>
    - <9, (6, 5, 3)>

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [34].
