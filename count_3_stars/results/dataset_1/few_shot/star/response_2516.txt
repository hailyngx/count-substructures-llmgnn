Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4)

Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that have exactly three neighbors. These nodes will serve as the center of the 3-star graphs.

Let's identify the 3-star graphs:

1. Node 0 has 6 neighbors: 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 (It forms 3-stars with nodes 3, 5, 6), so we have <0, (3, 5, 6)>
2. Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 0, 4, 8, 9 (It forms a 3-star with node 0 and another 3-star with nodes 4, 8, 9), so we have <3, (0, 4, 8)> and <3, (4, 8, 9)>
3. Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 4 (It forms 3-stars with nodes 0, 1, 2), so we have <5, (0, 1, 2)>
4. Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 0, 3, 6, 7 (It forms 3-stars with nodes 0, 3, 6, and 7), so we have <8, (0, 3, 6)> and <8, (0, 3, 7)>
5. Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 4 (It forms 3-stars with nodes 0, 2, 3, 4), so we have <9, (0, 2, 3)> and <9, (0, 3, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [7]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (3, 5, 6)>, <3, (0, 4, 8)>, <3, (4, 8, 9)>, <5, (0, 1, 2)>, <8, (0, 3, 6)>, <8, (0, 3, 7)>, <9, (0, 2, 3)>, <9, (0, 3, 4)>
