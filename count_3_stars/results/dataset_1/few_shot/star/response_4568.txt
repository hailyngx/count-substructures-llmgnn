Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern, which consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Given the information provided, we can identify the 3-stars as follows:
1. Node 0: (1, 3, 6)
2. Node 1: (0, 2, 8)
3. Node 2: (1, 6, 8)
4. Node 6: (0, 2, 7)
5. Node 7: (4, 6, 8)
6. Node 8: (1, 2, 7)
7. Node 9: (4, 5, 6)

Hence, there are a total of [7] 3-stars in the given graph.
<0, (1, 3, 6)>, <1, (0, 2, 8)>, <2, (1, 6, 8)>, <6, (0, 2, 7)>, <7, (4, 6, 8)>, <8, (1, 2, 7)>, <9, (4, 5, 6)>
