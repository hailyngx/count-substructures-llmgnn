Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 5
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique instances where a node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes in a star-like pattern. 

Looking at the graph and the adjacency list, we can identify the 3-stars as follows:

<0, (1, 2, 7)>
<1, (0, 2, 5)>
<2, (0, 1, 5)>
<5, (1, 2, 6)>
<6, (1, 3, 5)>
<9, (1, 4, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
