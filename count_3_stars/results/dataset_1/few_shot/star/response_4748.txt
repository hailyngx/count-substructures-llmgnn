Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 8

Response:
First, let's identify which nodes can be the centers of 3-star graphs based on the given graph structure. To be a center of a 3-star, a node must be connected to exactly three other nodes.

Nodes 0, 6, and 8 satisfy this criterion.

Next, let's find the 3-stars in the graph with each of these nodes as the center.

For Node 0:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 6, and 8. 
So, the possible 3-stars with Node 0 as the center are <0, (4, 5, 6)>, <0, (4, 5, 8)>, <0, (4, 6, 8)>, and <0, (5, 6, 8)>.

For Node 6:
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0 and 7. 
So, the possible 3-star with Node 6 as the center is <6, (0, 7, 8)>.

For Node 8:
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, and 9. 
So, the possible 3-stars with Node 8 as the center are <8, (0, 1, 4)>, <8, (0, 1, 9)>, and <8, (0, 4, 9)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [7].
The unique 3-stars found are <0, (4, 5, 6)>, <0, (4, 5, 8)>, <0, (4, 6, 8)>, <0, (5, 6, 8)>, <6, (0, 7, 8)>, <8, (0, 1, 4)>, and <8, (0, 1, 9)>.
