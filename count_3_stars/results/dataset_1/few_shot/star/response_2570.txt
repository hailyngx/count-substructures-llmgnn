Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 1) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 2
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Upon examining the adjacency list provided, we can see that only nodes 0, 1, and 2 satisfy the criteria for being the center of a 3-star as they are each connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<1, (0, 2, 4)>
<2, (0, 1, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
