Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 5, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible 3-stars. 

Let's start by listing the 3-stars present in the graph:

<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<0, (1, 2, 7)>
<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<1, (0, 2, 7)>
<2, (0, 1, 7)>
<2, (4, 7, 9)>
<3, (1, 2, 4)>
<4, (2, 3, 8)>
<5, (0, 9, 2)>
<7, (0, 1, 2)>
<7, (0, 8, 9)>
<8, (4, 7, 9)>
<9, (2, 7, 8)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we get a total of [11].
