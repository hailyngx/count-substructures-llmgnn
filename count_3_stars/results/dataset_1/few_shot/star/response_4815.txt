Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 7, and node 8

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are as follows:

<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<0, (1, 4, 8)>
<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<4, (0, 3, 8)>
<4, (3, 5, 8)>
<8, (0, 1, 4)>
<8, (0, 4, 9)>  

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
