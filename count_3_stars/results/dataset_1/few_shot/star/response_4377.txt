Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 2

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star. 

Inspecting the adjacency list for each node, we can identify the following 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<1, (0, 3, 6)>
<2, (0, 5, 8)>
<3, (1, 5, 6)>
<4, (0, 1, 6)>
<5, (2, 3)>
<6, (1, 3, 4)>
<7, (1, 6)>
<8, (0, 2, 3)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
