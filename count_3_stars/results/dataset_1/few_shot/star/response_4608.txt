Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star-like pattern. In this case, each 3-star will have one central node and three leaves.

Looking at the provided graph, we can identify the following 3-stars along with their central node and leaves:

<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<1, (0, 2, 6)>
<2, (1, 3, 9)>
<3, (2, 5)>
<5, (3)>
<6, (0, 1, 9)>
<7, (0, 1)>
<9, (2, 6)>

Considering all these unique 3-stars present in the graph, we find a total of [8] 3-stars.
