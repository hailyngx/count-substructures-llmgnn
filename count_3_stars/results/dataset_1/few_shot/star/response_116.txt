Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 7

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (2, 4, 7)>
2. <2, (0, 5, 9)>
3. <3, (0, 4, 5)>
4. <4, (0, 3, 5)>
5. <5, (0, 2, 3)>
6. <6, (5, 7, 8)>
7. <7, (0, 6, 9)>
8. <8, (2, 6)>
9. <9, (2, 4, 7)>
