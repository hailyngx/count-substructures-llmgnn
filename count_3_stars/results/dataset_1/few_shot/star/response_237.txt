Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<1, (0, 3, 6)>
<2, (0, 9, -)>
<3, (1, 4, 5)>
<4, (3, 5, 6)>
<5, (0, 3, 4)>
<6, (1, 4, 5)>
<8, (0, 5, 6)>

Counting the unique 3-stars above, we get a total of [9].
