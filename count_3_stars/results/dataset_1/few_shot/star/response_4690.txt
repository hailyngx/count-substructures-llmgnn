Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (3, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (8, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 6
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 
A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list all the 3-stars:

<1, (6, 7, 8)>
<4, (5, 6, 8)>
<6, (1, 4, 8)>
<8, (6, 4, 1)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph. 
There are 4 unique 3-stars, so the total count of 3-stars is [4].
