Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8)

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Given that a 3-star consists of a central node connected to three other nodes by edges, we can deduce the following:

- For each node in the graph, identify if it is connected to exactly three other nodes.
- If so, form a 3-star with the central node being the identified node and the other three nodes being its neighbors.

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

<1, (0, 2, 5)>
<2, (1, 4, 6)>
<3, (4, 8, 9)>
<4, (2, 3, 6)>
<5, (1, 3, 6)>
<6, (2, 4, 5)>
<7, (4, 8, 9)>
<8, (1, 3, 7)>
<9, (1, 3, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
