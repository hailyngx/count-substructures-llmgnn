Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 8

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

Since a 3-star has a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can identify the 3-stars based on the nodes connected to each node.

Potential 3-stars can be formed from nodes with three edges, i.e., nodes 0, 2, 5, and 8. 

After examining the graph, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (1, 8)>
<2, (1, 7, 9)>
<5, (4, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 5, 9)>

Counting the unique 3-stars found:
