Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 3

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star pattern.

Based on the given information, the 3-stars in the graph are as follows:
<1, (3, 6, 9)>
<3, (1, 4, 7)>
<6, (1, 2, 4)>
<7, (3, 5, -)>

There are a total of [4] 3-stars in the graph.
