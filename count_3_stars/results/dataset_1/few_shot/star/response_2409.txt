Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 7

Response:
First, let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:
1. For Node 0: (0, 1, 4), (0, 1, 9)
2. For Node 1: (1, 0, 6)
3. For Node 2: (2, 5, 6), (2, 6, 7), (2, 6, 8)
4. For Node 4: (4, 0, 7)
5. For Node 6: (6, 1, 2), (6, 2, 5), (6, 2, 8)
6. For Node 7: (7, 4, 8), (7, 4, 9)
7. For Node 8: (8, 3, 6)
8. For Node 9: (9, 0, 7)

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the graph are:
<0, (1, 4, 9)>, <1, (0, 6)>, <2, (5, 6, 7)>, <2, (6, 8)>, <4, (0, 7)>, <6, (1, 2)>, <6, (2, 5)>, <7, (4, 8)>, <7, (4, 9)>, <8, (3, 6)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
