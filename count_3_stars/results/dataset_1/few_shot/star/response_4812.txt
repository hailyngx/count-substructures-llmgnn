Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a 3-star pattern. 

Observing the adjacency list of each node, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<1, (0, 8, 9)>
<4, (1, 3, 9)>
<5, (0, 8, 9)>
<6, (0, 7, 8)>
<7, (1, 2, 4)>
<8, (0, 1, 6)>
<9, (1, 4, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-star patterns in the given graph is [8].
