Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. These instances represent 3-stars with the respective node as the center.

Upon examining the adjacency list for each node, we find the following 3-stars:
<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<1, (0, 3, 6)>
<6, (0, 1, 2)>
<7, (0, 2, 3)>
<3, (1, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
