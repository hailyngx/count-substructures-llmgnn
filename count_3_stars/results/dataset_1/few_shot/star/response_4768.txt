Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes with no connections between those three nodes. 

Finding 3-stars:
- Node 0 is a part of 2 unique 3-stars: <0, (2, 3, 5)> and <0, (3, 5, 6)>
- Node 2 is a part of 1 unique 3-star: <2, (4, 6, 8)>
- Node 3 is a part of 2 unique 3-stars: <3, (0, 5, 6)> and <3, (4, 5, 6)>
- Node 4 is a part of 1 unique 3-star: <4, (2, 3, 9)>
- Node 5 is a part of 2 unique 3-stars: <5, (0, 3, 6)> and <5, (3, 4, 9)>
- Node 6 is a part of 2 unique 3-stars: <6, (2, 3, 5)> and <6, (0, 3, 5)>
- Node 8 is a part of 1 unique 3-star: <8, (2, 9, 4)>
- Node 9 is a part of 1 unique 3-star: <9, (4, 5, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [11].
