Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each unique 3-star pattern where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Looking at the graph description:
- Node 1, 6, 9 do not have any 3-star configurations as they do not have exactly 3 neighbors.
- Nodes 0 and 8 are connected to only one neighbor, so they cannot form 3-star patterns.

Now, let's identify the 3-star configurations in this graph:

- <2, (3, 5, 9)>
- <3, (2, 4, 8)>
- <4, (3, 6, 7)>
- <5, (2, 3, 7)>
- <7, (4, 5, 8)>

Therefore, there are [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
