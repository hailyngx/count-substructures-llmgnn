Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a 3-star pattern. 

We start by looking at each node and its connections to see if it forms a 3-star. 

Calculating the number of 3-stars in the graph:
[3] 

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 3, 9)>
<1, (0, 2, 5)>
<2, (1, 3, 6)>
<4, (3, 5, 6)>
<5, (1, 3, 4)>
