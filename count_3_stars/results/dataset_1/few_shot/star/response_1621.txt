Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's start by listing all the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (2, 6, 9)>
<1, (2, 4, 5)>
<2, (0, 1, 6)>
<3, (7, 9)>
<4, (1, 6, 8)>
<5, (1, 7, 8)>
<6, (0, 2, 4)>
<7, (3, 5, 6)>
<8, (1, 4, 5)>
<9, (0, 3, 7)>

There are a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
