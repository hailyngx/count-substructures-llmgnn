Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to understand what constitutes a 3-star. As mentioned earlier, a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

In this graph, the central nodes with exactly three neighbors are nodes 0, 1, 4, and 5. Let's find the 3-stars for each of these central nodes:

1. Central node 0:
    - <0, (1, 4, 5)>
    
2. Central node 1:
    - <1, (0, 5, 6)>
    - <1, (0, 5, 9)>
    
3. Central node 4:
    - <4, (0, 3, 9)>
    
4. Central node 5:
    - <5, (0, 1, 6)>
    - <5, (0, 1, 9)>

Count of 3-stars in the given graph: [5]
