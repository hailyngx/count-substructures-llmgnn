Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 9
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern. A 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list the unique 3-stars found in this graph:

<0, (2, 7, 0)>
<2, (0, 7, 2)>
<5, (1, 2, 4)>
<6, (2, 7, 9)>
<7, (0, 2, 9)>
<9, (6, 7, 9)>

Count of 3-stars: [6]
