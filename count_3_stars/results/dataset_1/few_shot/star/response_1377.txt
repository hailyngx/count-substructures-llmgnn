Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star-like pattern.

I'll list the 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (3, 6, 7)>
<6, (0, 1, 4)>
<2, (5, 6, 9)>
<9, (0, 6, 8)>

There are a total of [4] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
