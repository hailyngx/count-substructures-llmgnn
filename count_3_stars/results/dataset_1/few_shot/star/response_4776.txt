Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 7, and node 8

Response:
There are 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

The 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 5, 8)>
<7, (1, 2, 9)>

So the total number of 3-stars is [2].
