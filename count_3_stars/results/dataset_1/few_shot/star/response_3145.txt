Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 3

Response:
There are a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (5, 7, 8)>
<4, (2, 5, 7)>
<5, (0, 4, 7)>
<7, (0, 4, 5)>
<8, (0, 5, 7)>
