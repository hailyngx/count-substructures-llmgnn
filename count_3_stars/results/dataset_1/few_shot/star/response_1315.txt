Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Since a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we need to find all such configurations in the graph.

Looking at the adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<1, (0, 2, 6)>
<2, (1, 9, 3)>
<3, (5, 7, 9)>
<6, (1, 4, 9)>
<7, (1, 8, 9)>
<9, (2, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
