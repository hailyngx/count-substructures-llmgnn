Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars:

1. Node 0 forms 1 <0, (2, 6, 7)> 3-star.
2. Node 1 forms 1 <1, (3, 4, 6)> 3-star.
3. Node 2 forms 1 <2, (0, 3, 5)> 3-star.
4. Node 3 forms 1 <3, (1, 2, 8)> 3-star.
5. Node 4 forms 1 <4, (1, 5, 9)> 3-star.
6. Node 5 forms 1 <5, (2, 4, 6)> 3-star.
7. Node 6 forms 2 <6, (0, 1, 3)> and <6, (5, 7, 8)> 3-stars.

Counting the total number of 3-stars: [7]
