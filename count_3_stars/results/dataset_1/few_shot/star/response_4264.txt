Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 4) (6, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 8

Response:
First, let's identify all possible 3-stars in the given graph.

1. Node 0: (0, 1, 9)
2. Node 1: (1, 0, 2), (1, 8, 0)
3. Node 2: (2, 1, 4)
4. Node 4: (4, 2, 5), (4, 5, 6), (4, 6, 9), (4, 9, 0)
5. Node 8: (8, 1, 7)
6. Node 9: (9, 0, 4), (9, 4, 8)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9]. 

Unique 3-stars: 
<0, (1, 9, 4)>
<1, (0, 2, 4)>
<1, (8, 0, 2)>
<4, (2, 5, 6)>
<4, (5, 6, 9)>
<4, (6, 9, 0)>
<4, (9, 0, 2)>
<8, (1, 7, 9)>
<9, (0, 4, 8)>
