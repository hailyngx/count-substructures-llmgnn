Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 6

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star configuration. 

Looking at the given graph information, we see that the 3-star configurations can be identified as follows:

<Node 0, (3, 4, 8)>
<Node 1, (2, 3, 5)>
<Node 2, (1, 3, 9)>
<Node 2, (3, 6, 7)>
<Node 2, (4, 6, 9)>
<Node 3, (0, 1, 6)>
<Node 3, (2, 5, 6)>
<Node 4, (0, 2, 5)>
<Node 6, (2, 3, 9)>

Counting the unique configurations, we find that there are [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
