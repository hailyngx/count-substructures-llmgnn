Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 7

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star graphs in this network:

1. <0, (1, 3, 5)>
2. <1, (0, 4, 5)>
3. <1, (6, 7, 8)>
4. <1, (3, 5, 8)>
5. <2, (4, 9, 6)>
6. <3, (0, 5, 8)>
7. <6, (1, 7, 9)>
8. <7, (1, 6, 9)>

Therefore, there are [8] 3-star graphs in the given network.
