Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each central node and its adjacent nodes to check if they form a 3-star. 

Let's go through each node:
- Node 0: Forms 1 3-star <0, (3, 7, 9)>
- Node 1: Forms 1 3-star <1, (2, 6, 7)>
- Node 2: Does not form any 3-star
- Node 3: Does not form any 3-star
- Node 4: Does not form any 3-star
- Node 5: Does not form any 3-star
- Node 6: Forms 1 3-star <6, (1, 4, 8)>
- Node 7: Forms 1 3-star <7, (0, 1, 8)>
- Node 8: Forms 2 3-stars <8, (3, 6, 9)> and <8, (5, 6, 7)>
- Node 9: Does not form any 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6]. 
The unique 3-stars are <0, (3, 7, 9)>, <1, (2, 6, 7)>, <6, (1, 4, 8)>, <7, (0, 1, 8)>, <8, (3, 6, 9)>, and <8, (5, 6, 7)>.
