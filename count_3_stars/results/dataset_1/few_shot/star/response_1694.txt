Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars where a central node is connected to three leaves. Here are the steps to find the 3-stars:

1. Identify nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.
2. For each of these nodes, list the unique 3-stars they form.

Based on the given adjacency information, the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes are: node 3 and node 8.

For Node 3:
Unique 3-star with Node 3 as the center:
<3, (0, 1, 8)>
<3, (1, 0, 8)>

For Node 8:
Unique 3-star with Node 8 as the center:
<8, (0, 3, 9)>
<8, (3, 0, 9)>
<8, (4, 6, 7)>
<8, (6, 4, 7)>
<8, (7, 4, 6)>
<8, (7, 6, 4)>
<8, (9, 0, 3)>
<8, (9, 3, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
