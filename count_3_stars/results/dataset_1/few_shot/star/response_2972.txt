Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 3

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars, we need to identify all instances where a node is the center of a 3-star in the given graph. 

Looking at the graph description, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (3, 7, 8)>
<1, (4, 5, 6)>
<4, (1, 5, 6)>
<7, (0, 4, 6)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4]. 
   
Here are the unique 3-stars:
<0, (3, 7, 8)>
<1, (4, 5, 6)>
<4, (1, 5, 6)>
<7, (0, 4, 6)>
