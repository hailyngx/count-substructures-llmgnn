Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph and list them, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify the center node of each 3-star.
2. For each center node, find its neighbors.
3. Check if the neighbors are connected to exactly two other nodes in addition to the center (forming a 3-star).
4. List and count the unique 3-stars found.

Let's go ahead and find the 3-stars present in the given graph:

The 3-stars in the graph are as follows:
[4] 

Explanation:
- The 3-star with center node 4 and leaves 7, 8, and 9: <4, (7, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the final answer is [1].
