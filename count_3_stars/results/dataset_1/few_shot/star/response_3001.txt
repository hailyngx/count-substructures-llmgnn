Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the unique 3-stars present. 

Looking at the adjacency list for each node, we can identify the 3-stars as follows:
- Node 1 is the center connected to nodes 0, 4, 8.
- Node 5 is the center connected to nodes 0, 2, 8.
- Node 6 is the center connected to nodes 5, 7, 9.
- Node 8 is the center connected to nodes 1, 4, 5.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are:
<1, (0, 4, 8)>
<5, (0, 2, 8)>
<6, (5, 7, 9)>
<8, (1, 4, 5)>

Since there are 4 unique 3-stars, the final answer is [4].
