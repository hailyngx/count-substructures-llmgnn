Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 3

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the cases where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, creating a 3-star pattern. Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (5, 6, 9)>
<1, (4, 7, 5)>
<2, (8, 9, 5)>
<3, (7, 9, 5)>

These are all the unique cases of 3-stars in the graph. Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars by listing them inside brackets []:
