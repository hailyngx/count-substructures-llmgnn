Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7

Response:
To identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph, we look for nodes that have exactly three neighbors connected to them. 

From the adjacency list:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 1 neighbor
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 1 neighbor
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors

Nodes 2, 7, 8, and 9 are the only nodes that have exactly three neighbors. 

Calculating the number of 3-star graphs:
- Node 2 can form one 3-star: <2, (1, 5, 6)>
- Node 7 can form four 3-stars: <7, (4, 5, 8)>, <7, (5, 8, 9)>, <7, (4, 8, 9)>, <7, (4, 5, 9)>
- Node 8 can form four 3-stars: <8, (1, 5, 7)>, <8, (1, 7, 9)>, <8, (1, 5, 9)>, <8, (5, 7, 9)>
- Node 9 can form one 3-star: <9, (1, 3, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [10]. 
The unique 3-stars found are <2, (1, 5, 6)>, <7, (4, 5, 8)>, <7, (5, 8, 9)>, <7, (4, 8, 9)>, <7, (4, 5, 9)>, <8, (1, 5, 7)>, <8, (1, 7, 9)>, <8, (1, 5, 9)>, <8, (5, 7, 9)>, and <9, (1, 3, 7)>.
