Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (2, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star in the graph. 

Let's proceed step by step:

1. Node 3 forms one potential 3-star with its neighbors 4 and 9.

2. Node 4 forms one potential 3-star with its neighbors 3 and 5.

3. Node 5 forms one potential 3-star with its neighbors 4 and 9.

4. Node 6 does not form a 3-star because it is connected to three nodes but not in a 3-star configuration.

To summarize, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found are: 
<3, (4, 5, 9)>
<4, (3, 5, 9)>
