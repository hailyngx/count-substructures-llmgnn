Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a star-like structure.

There are three 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are listed inside angle brackets <>:
<0, (2, 3, 6)>
<0, (2, 3, 7)>
<0, (2, 3, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
