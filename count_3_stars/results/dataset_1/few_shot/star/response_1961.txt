Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 6, 7, and node 8

Response:
Given the graph, we can see that there are 4 possible 3-stars centered at nodes 4, 5, 6, and 9. Let's go through each one.

<4, (1, 3, 6)>
<5, (0, 3, 6)>
<6, (1, 2, 4)>
<9, (0, 6, 7)>

Therefore, there are a total of [4] 3-stars in the graph.
