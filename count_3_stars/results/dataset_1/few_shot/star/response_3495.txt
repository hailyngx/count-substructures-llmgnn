Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and node 7

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be calculated by checking each node and counting the number of 3-stars centered at that node. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (1, 3, 9)>
<1, (0, 6, 8)>
<2, (4, 5, 9)>
<3, (0, 6, 8)>
<4, (2, 8, 9)>
<5, (2, 7, 9)>
<6, (1, 3, 8)>
<7, (5, 9)>
<8, (1, 3, 4)>
<9, (0, 1, 2)>

Counting the unique 3-stars listed above, we find that there are a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
