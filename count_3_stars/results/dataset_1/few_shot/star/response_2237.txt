Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we can list out the possible 3-stars in this graph:
<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<0, (2, 3, 5)>
<0, (2, 3, 9)>
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<2, (0, 3, 5)>
<2, (0, 3, 7)>
<2, (3, 5, 9)>
<3, (0, 2, 9)>
<3, (2, 7, 9)>
<4, (0, 7, 8)>
<5, (0, 2, 9)>
<7, (2, 3, 9)>
<9, (0, 3, 5)>
<9, (0, 3, 6)>
<9, (3, 5, 6)>

Counting these unique 3-stars, we get the total number of 3-stars in the graph:
