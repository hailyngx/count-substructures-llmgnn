Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify all possible 3-stars based on the definition provided. A 3-star has a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

In this graph, the central node and its adjacent nodes will form a 3-star. Let's list them:

<0, (2, 5, 6)>
<2, (0, 3, 6)>
<3, (1, 2, 8)>
<5, (0, 1, 7)>
<6, (0, 2, 7)>
<7, (5, 6, 8)>
<8, (3, 7, 9)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars based on the identified combinations:
