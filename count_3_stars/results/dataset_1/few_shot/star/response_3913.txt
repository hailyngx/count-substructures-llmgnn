Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 3
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify the unique 3-stars present in the graph. 

Here are the unique 3-stars in the graph: 
<1, (2, 4, 5)>
<3, (0, 4, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
