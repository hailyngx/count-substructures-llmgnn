Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 4, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the 3-stars present. 

Let's start by listing the unique 3-stars we can find in this graph.

<1, (3, 6, 9)>
<2, (3, 6, 8)>
<3, (1, 2, 5)>
<3, (1, 5, 9)>
<3, (2, 5, 6)>
<3, (5, 6, 9)> 

Counting all the unique 3-stars found, we get a total of [6].
