Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 10 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 7) (5, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 0
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 9
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we will look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's analyze each node in the graph:

- Node 0: Not a part of any 3-star.
- Node 1: Not connected to any other node.
- Node 2: Forms a 3-star <2, (3, 7)>.
- Node 3: Forms a 3-star <3, (2, 7)>.
- Node 4: Not connected to any other node.
- Node 5: Not a part of any 3-star.
- Node 6: Not connected to any other node.
- Node 7: Forms two 3-stars <7, (2, 3)> and <7, (3, 9)>.
- Node 8: Not connected to any other node.
- Node 9: Not a part of any 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: <2, (3, 7)>, <3, (2, 7)>, <7, (2, 3)>, <7, (3, 9)>.
