Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes (3-stars). 

Let's list down the 3-stars found in the graph:

<2, (4, 5, 6)>
<3, (1, 7, 9)>
<4, (0, 2, 5)>
<5, (2, 6, 7)>
<6, (1, 2, 5)>
<7, (0, 3, 5)>
<9, (3, 7, -not possible)">
 
There are a total of [7] 3-stars in the given graph.
