Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star configuration.

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (1, 2, 9)>
<2, (0, 3, 9)>
<3, (2, 9, 6)>
<4, (7, 5, 6)>
<5, (6, 7, 8)>
<6, (5, 7, 9)>
<7, (4, 5, 6)>
<8, (7)>
<9, (2, 3, 6)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
