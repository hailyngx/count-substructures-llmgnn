Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 6
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

From the adjacency list provided:
- Node 2 and Node 5 are the only nodes connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Next, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<2, (3, 4, 7)>
<5, (1, 4, 9)>
  
Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
