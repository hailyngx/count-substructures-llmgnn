Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph, we need to find each occurrence of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the 3-star graphs present in the graph:

1. Node 0: <0, (3, 9)>
2. Node 1: <1, (8, 9)>
3. Node 9: <9, (0, 1, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [3].
