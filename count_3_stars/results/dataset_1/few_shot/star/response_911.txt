Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 3

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify all possible 3-stars. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Looking at the given graph, we can identify the following 3-stars:

<0, (2, 8, 1)>
<1, (2, 3, 6)>
<2, (0, 1, 5)>
<3, (1, 6, 8)>
<4, (7, 8, 0)>
<5, (1, 2, 6)>
<6, (1, 3, 5)>
<8, (0, 2, 4)>
<9, (3)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we have a total of [9] 3-stars in the graph.
