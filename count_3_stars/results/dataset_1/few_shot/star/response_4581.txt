Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 3

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes in a star configuration. 

From the adjacency list given, we can identify the following unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<1, (0, 2, 5)>
<2, (1, 7, 8)>
<3, (0, 5, 9)>
<4, (0, 6, 7)>
<5, (1, 3, 8)>
<6, (1, 4, 8)>
<7, (2, 4, 8)>
<8, (2, 5, 6)>
<9, (2, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
