Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 4

Response:
