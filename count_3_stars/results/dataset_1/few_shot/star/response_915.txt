Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- In this case, a 3-star consists of a central node connected to three other nodes.
- We will loop through each node and check if it is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars in the graph: 

<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<0, (2, 3, 7)>
<0, (2, 3, 8)>
<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<0, (2, 7, 6)>
<0, (3, 1, 8)>
<0, (4, 1, 6)>
<0, (4, 6, 7)>
<0, (6, 2, 7)>
<2, (0, 1, 8)>
<3, (0, 2, 8)>
<4, (0, 6, 1)>
<6, (0, 7, 2)>
<7, (0, 6, 2)>
<8, (0, 1, 2)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].
