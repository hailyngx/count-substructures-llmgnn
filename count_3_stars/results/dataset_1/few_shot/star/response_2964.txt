Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star and then count how many unique ones exist. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<0, (5, 2, 8)>
<0, (6, 3, 4)>
<0, (8, 7, 9)>
<1, (0, 6, 3)>
<2, (3, 4, 8)>
<2, (4, 3, 6)>
<3, (2, 5, 6)>
<3, (4, 2, 5)>
<3, (5, 7, 8)>
<4, (2, 3, 6)>
<4, (3, 6, 9)>
<5, (0, 2, 8)>
<5, (2, 3, 7)>
<6, (0, 1, 3)>
<6, (0, 3, 4)>
<6, (1, 3, 7)>
<6, (3, 4, 7)>
<7, (3, 5, 8)>
<7, (5, 6, 8)>
<8, (0, 2, 5)>
<8, (0, 5, 7)>
<8, (2, 5, 7)>
<8, (5, 7, 6)>
<9, (0, 4, 6)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we get a total of [25].
