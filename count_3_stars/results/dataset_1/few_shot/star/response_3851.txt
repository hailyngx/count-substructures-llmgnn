Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we can see that the possible 3-star formations can be found around nodes 1, 5, 6, 7 since they have connections to exactly three other nodes. Let's list them down:

<1, (3, 5, 7)>
<5, (1, 2, 4)>
<5, (1, 4, 6)>
<5, (2, 4, 6)>
<5, (4, 6, 9)>
<6, (1, 2, 4)>
<6, (1, 4, 5)>
<6, (2, 4, 5)>
<6, (4, 5, 9)>
<7, (1, 3, 5)>
<8, (0, 1, 7)>

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars.
