Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 6

Response:
First, we can determine the central nodes of each potential 3-star in the graph by identifying nodes with exactly three neighbors. These central nodes could be part of a 3-star.

1. Potential 3-star centers:
- Node 0: 2 neighbors (not a potential center)
- Node 1: 6 neighbors (potential center)
- Node 2: 3 neighbors (potential center)
- Node 3: 3 neighbors (potential center)
- Node 4: 3 neighbors (potential center)
- Node 5: 1 neighbor (not a potential center)
- Node 6: 2 neighbors (not a potential center)
- Node 7: 4 neighbors (not a potential center)
- Node 8: 3 neighbors (potential center)
- Node 9: 2 neighbors (not a potential center)

2. Let's examine each potential center:
- Node 1: (0, 2, 4, 7, 8, 9) - Forms 3-stars with (2, 4, 7), (8, 4, 7), and (9, 4, 7).
- Node 2: (1, 3, 8) - Forms 3-star with (1, 3, 8).
- Node 3: (2, 6, 7) - Forms 3-star with (2, 6, 7).
- Node 4: (0, 1, 7) - Forms 3-star with (0, 1, 7).
- Node 8: (1, 2, 5) - Forms 3-star with (1, 2, 5).

3. So the unique 3-stars in the graph are:
- <1, (2, 4, 7)>
- <1, (8, 4, 7)>
- <1, (9, 4, 7)>
- <2, (1, 3, 8)>
- <3, (2, 6, 7)>
- <4, (0, 1, 7)>
- <8, (1, 2, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
