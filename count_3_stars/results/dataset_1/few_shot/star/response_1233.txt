Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-star configurations. 

Let's consider the nodes and their connections:

Node 0: (5, 6, 8)
Node 1: (3, 7)
Node 2: (6, 8, 9)
Node 3: (1, 6, 8, 9)
Node 4: (6)
Node 5: (0, 8, 9)
Node 6: (0, 2, 3, 4)
Node 7: (1)
Node 8: (0, 2, 3, 5)
Node 9: (2, 3, 5)

Now, let's identify the 3-stars: 

<0, (5, 8, 6)>
<0, (6, 8, 5)>
<0, (8, 5, 9)>
<0, (8, 6, 5)>
<2, (8, 9, 3)>
<3, (1, 6, 8)>
<3, (6, 8, 5)>
<3, (8, 9, 2)>
<5, (0, 8, 9)>
<5, (8, 0, 9)>

There are 10 unique 3-stars in total. 
Therefore, the count of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
