Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Looking at the adjacency list provided:
- Node 0 has 2 connections
- Node 1 has 1 connection
- Node 2 has 4 connections
- Node 3 has 3 connections
- Node 4 has 2 connections
- Node 5 has 4 connections
- Node 6 has 1 connection
- Node 7 has 3 connections
- Node 8 has 1 connection
- Node 9 has 3 connections

Based on the information given, the unique 3-stars in the graph can be identified as:
<2, (1, 3, 5)>
<3, (2, 7, 9)>
<5, (0, 2, 3)>
<7, (0, 4, 9)>

Counting these unique 3-stars, we find that there are [4] 3-stars in the graph.
