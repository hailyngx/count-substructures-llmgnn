Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 44 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3)

Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 3

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will look for each possible 3-star configuration. Since a 3-star has a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we will examine each node as a potential central node.

Starting with node 0:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 5, and 8: <0, (1, 5, 8)>
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, and 9: <0, (1, 3, 9)>
- Node 0 does NOT form any other 3-star configurations.

Moving to node 1:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 3, and 9: <1, (0, 3, 9)>
- Node 1 does NOT form any other 3-star configurations.

Moving to node 2:
- Node 2 does NOT form any 3-star configurations as it is not connected to exactly three other nodes.

Moving to node 3:
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 5, and 9: <3, (0, 5, 9)>
- Node 3 does NOT form any other 3-star configurations.

No other nodes form 3-star configurations. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3]. The unique 3-stars found are <0, (1, 5, 8)>, <0, (1, 3, 9)>, and <3, (0, 5, 9)>.
