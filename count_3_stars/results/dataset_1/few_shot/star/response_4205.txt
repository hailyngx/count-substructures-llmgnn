Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 7

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

From the given adjacency list and edge list, let's list the 3-stars:
1. Node 0: (7, 9, 7) [1]
2. Node 3: (6, 9, 7) [2]
3. Node 6: (3, 9, 7) [3]
4. Node 7: (0, 9, 7) [4]
5. Node 9: (3, 6, 7) [5]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5]. 

<0, (7, 9, 7)>
<3, (6, 9, 7)>
<6, (3, 9, 7)>
<7, (0, 9, 7)>
<9, (3, 6, 7)>
