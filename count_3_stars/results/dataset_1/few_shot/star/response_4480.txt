Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each unique set of four nodes where one node is connected to the other three nodes but those three nodes are not directly connected to each other. These sets represent 3-stars. 

In this case, after examining the graph based on the provided information, we find that there are [9] 3-stars in the graph. 

List of unique 3-stars: 
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<0, (2, 3, 5)>
<2, (3, 4, 6)>
<2, (3, 5, 6)>
<2, (4, 5, 6)>
<3, (5, 6, 7)>
<4, (8, 9)>
