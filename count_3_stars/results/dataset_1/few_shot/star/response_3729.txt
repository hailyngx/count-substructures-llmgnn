Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes would be the central nodes of the 3-stars.

In this graph, the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes are node 0, node 4, node 6, and node 7. We will now list the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (5, 6, 8)>
<4, (3, 5, 6)>
<6, (0, 1, 2)>
<7, (5, 6, 9)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars in the given graph: 
[4]
