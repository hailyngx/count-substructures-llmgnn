Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can identify each unique 3-star pattern. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Let's list the 3-star patterns in the graph:
   <0, (1, 5, 6)>
   <1, (0, 3, 8)>
   <3, (1, 2, 4)>
   <4, (3, 6, 7)>
   <5, (0)>
   <6, (0, 4)>
   <7, (4, 9)>
   <8, (0, 1)>
   <9, (3, 7)>

2. Now let's count the total number of unique 3-stars: 9

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
