Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 7

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, we can look for each node and its adjacent nodes, checking if there is a 3-star centered at that node. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list the unique 3-stars found:

<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<3, (1, 4, 5)>
<4, (1, 3, 7)>
<5, (0, 1, 9)>
<7, (3, 4, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
