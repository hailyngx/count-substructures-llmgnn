Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 8) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 4

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be calculated by examining each node in the graph.

For each node:
- Identify the node's neighbors
- Check if there exists a 3-star with the current node as the center and the neighbors as leaves

Let's go through each node to count the number of 3-stars and then provide the final count.

<Node 0, (4, 5, 8)>
<Node 4, (0, 2, 3)>
<Node 5, (0, 8, 6)>
<Node 8, (0, 5, 7)>
<Node 9, (1, 4, 7)>
