Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star-like pattern. Let's go through the nodes and see if they form any 3-stars.

<0, (2, 8, 4)>
<1, (6, 7, 0)>
<4, (3, 5, 8)>
<5, (3, 4, 9)>

So, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
