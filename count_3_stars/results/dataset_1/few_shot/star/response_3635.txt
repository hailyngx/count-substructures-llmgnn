Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 4

Response:
There are several 3-stars in the given graph. Let's identify and count them:

<0, (5, 6, 9)>
<1, (6, 7, -)>
<2, (5, -, -)>
<3, (6, 9, -)>
<4, (5, 6, 8)>
<5, (0, 2, 4)>
<6, (0, 1, 3)>
<7, (1, 8, -)>
<8, (4, 5, 6)>
<9, (0, 3, -)>

By counting the unique 3-stars found, we get a total of [9].
