Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star in the graph. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we can see that the center node of a 3-star must have at least 3 edges connected to it. Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

1. <3, (4, 6, 8)>
2. <4, (3, 6, 9)>
3. <6, (4, 5, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3]. 

Final answer: [3]
