Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 2) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 2
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph. 

From the given information, we can determine the following 3-stars:
<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<1, (2, 4, 9)>
<2, (0, 1, 9)>
<4, (0, 1, 6)>
<9, (1, 2, 5)>

There are [5] 3-stars in total.
