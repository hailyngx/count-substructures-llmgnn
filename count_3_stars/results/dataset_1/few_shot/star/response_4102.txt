Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 5, and node 8

Response:
There are two 3-stars in the given graph. Here is how you can find them:

1. For Node 0:
   - <0, (1, 2, 6)>
   - <0, (8, 9, 1)>

2. For Node 9:
   - <9, (0, 3, 4)>
