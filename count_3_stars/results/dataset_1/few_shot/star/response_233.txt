Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify sets of nodes where one node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Starting from each node in the graph, we can identify the 3-stars that have that node as the center, by looking at the nodes it is connected to and checking if those connections form a 3-star pattern.

Here are the 3-stars found in the given graph:
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<0, (3, 5, 9)>
<3, (0, 4, 8)>
<4, (0, 3, 8)>
<5, (0, 1, 8)>
<8, (3, 5, 6)>
<8, (7, 9, 5)>
<9, (0, 2, 7)>

Count of 3-stars in the given graph: [7]
