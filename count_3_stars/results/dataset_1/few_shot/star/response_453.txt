Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 7

Response:
There are 3-stars at the following nodes: <0, (1, 4, 6)>, <1, (0, 7, 8)>, <3, (5, 8, 9)>, <9, (2, 3, 7)>.
As we can see, there are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
