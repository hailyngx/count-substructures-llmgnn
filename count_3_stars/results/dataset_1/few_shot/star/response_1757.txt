Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 6, and node 7

Response:
First, let's identify the central node and its adjacent nodes for each potential 3-star in the graph. 

For Node 0: <0, (1, 2, 8)>
For Node 1: <1, (0, 8, -)>  [Incomplete as less than 3 adjacent nodes]
For Node 2: <2, (0, 3, -)>  [Incomplete as less than 3 adjacent nodes]
For Node 3: <3, (2, 4, 5)>
For Node 4: <4, (3, 5, 6)>
For Node 5: <5, (3, 4, 8)>
For Node 6: <6, (4, 8, 9)>
For Node 7: <7, (3, 4, 9)>
For Node 8: <8, (0, 1, 5)>
For Node 9: <9, (0, 3, 4)>

Now let's count the total number of 3-stars in the given graph.
