Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all the 3-stars present. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Identify all nodes that are part of a 3-star configuration:
   - Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 6, and 7 forming a 3-star centered at node 3.
   - Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 7, and 8 forming three unique 3-stars centered at node 9: (9, 1, 4), (9, 1, 7), and (9, 1, 8).

2. Count the total number of unique 3-stars:
   - Total number of unique 3-stars = 1 (centered at node 3) + 3 (centered at node 9) = 4

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

<3, (1, 6, 7)>
<9, (1, 4, 7)>
<9, (1, 8, 9)>
<9, (4, 7, 8)>
