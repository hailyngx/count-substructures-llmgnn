Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes forming a star pattern. 

Here is the list of unique 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (1, 4, 8)>
<0, (1, 4, 9)>
<0, (1, 8, 9)>
<3, (4, 6, 7)>
<3, (4, 6, 8)>
<3, (4, 7, 8)>
<4, (0, 3, 8)>
<4, (0, 6, 7)>
<4, (3, 6, 7)>
<8, (0, 3, 9)>
<8, (0, 4, 9)>
<8, (3, 4, 9)>

Count of 3-stars: [12]
