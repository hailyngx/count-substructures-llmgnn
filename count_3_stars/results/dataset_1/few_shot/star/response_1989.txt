Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 5

Response:
First, we need to identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 
A 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes. 
Let's list the 3-stars present in the given graph: 

<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<1, (2, 3, 8)>
<2, (0, 1, 8)>
<3, (1, 4)>
<4, (0, 3)>
<5, (0, 6, 8)>
<8, (1, 2, 5)>
<9, (0, 5)>

After listing all the unique 3-stars, we count them to find the total number of 3-stars. 
So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is: [8].
