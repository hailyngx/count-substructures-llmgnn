Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 6

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph step by step:

Initially, to form a 3-star, we must have a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list all such configurations:
1. Node 0: (6, 8)
2. Node 1: (3, 5, 7)
3. Node 2: (6, 7)
4. Node 3: (1, 5, 7), (5, 9, 3), (7, 1, 2)
5. Node 4: (7, 9)
6. Node 5: (1, 3, 9)
7. Node 6: (0, 2, 9)
8. Node 9: (3, 4, 5), (4, 6, 9)

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars in this graph. 

[Total number of 3-stars: 10]

[<0, (6, 8)>, <1, (3, 5, 7)>, <2, (6, 7)>, <3, (1, 5, 7)>, <3, (5, 9, 3)>, <3, (7, 1, 2)>, <4, (7, 9)>, <5, (1, 3, 9)>, <6, (0, 2, 9)>, <9, (3, 4, 5)>, <9, (4, 6, 9)>]
