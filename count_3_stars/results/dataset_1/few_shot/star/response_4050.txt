Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Based on the provided adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<1, (0, 3, 7)>
<1, (2, 8, 3)>
<3, (0, 1, 9)>
<3, (4, 8, 7)>
<8, (1, 9, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
