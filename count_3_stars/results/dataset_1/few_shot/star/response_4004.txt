Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 9
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 7
