Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
The 3-star graph is a structure where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's find and count the number of 3-stars in this graph.

Let's list all the 3-stars that can be formed in this graph:

<0, (2, 3, 6)>
<0, (2, 6, 4)>
<0, (3, 6, 1)>
<0, (6, 1, 7)>
<4, (2, 6, 7)>
<6, (0, 1, 4)>
<6, (1, 4, 7)>

There are a total of [7] 3-star subgraphs in the given graph.
