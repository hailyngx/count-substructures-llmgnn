Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 6

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph. 
A 3-star consists of a center node and three other nodes connected to the center. Let's list the 3-stars: 

<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<1, (5, 6, 7)>, <1, (5, 6, 8)>
<4, (0, 2, 6)>, <4, (0, 3, 6)>, <4, (7, 6, 8)>
<6, (0, 1, 5)>, <6, (2, 4, 7)>, <6, (2, 4, 8)>, <6, (5, 7, 8)>, <6, (7, 8, 9)>  

Counting these unique 3-stars, we find that there are [9] 3-star graphs in the given graph.
