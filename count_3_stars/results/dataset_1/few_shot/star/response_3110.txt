Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 8) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 7

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are as follows:
<1, (4, 8, 9)>
<1, (8, 2, 4)>
<1, (9, 7, 8)>
<2, (4, 1, 3)>
<2, (8, 1, 4)>
<3, (8, 1, 4)>
<3, (8, 2, 4)>
<4, (1, 2, 3)>
<4, (1, 8, 2)>
<4, (1, 8, 3)>
<8, (1, 2, 3)>
<8, (1, 4, 2)>
<8, (1, 4, 3)>
<9, (1, 7, 8)>
<9, (7, 1, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [15].
