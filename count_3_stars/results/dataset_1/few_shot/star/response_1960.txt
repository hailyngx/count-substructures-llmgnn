Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges, forming a star pattern.

We will go through each node and check if it is the center of a 3-star:

1. **Node 0**: Not a center of a 3-star.
2. **Node 1**: Not a center of a 3-star.
3. **Node 2**: <2, (0, 4, 6)>
4. **Node 3**: Not a center of a 3-star.
5. **Node 4**: Not a center of a 3-star.
6. **Node 5**: Not a center of a 3-star.
7. **Node 6**: <6, (0, 3, 9)>
8. **Node 7**: Not a center of a 3-star.
9. **Node 8**: Not a center of a 3-star.
10. **Node 9**: Not a center of a 3-star.

Count of 3-stars: [2]

Unique 3-stars:
<2, (0, 4, 6)>
<6, (0, 3, 9)>
