Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node has three neighbors, forming a 3-star structure. Let's go through the adjacency list of each node and identify the 3-stars:

1. Node 0: (0, 5, 8), (0, 5, 9), (0, 8, 9)
2. Node 1: No 3-stars (as it only has one neighbor)
3. Node 2: (2, 1, 5), (2, 1, 9), (2, 5, 6), (2, 5, 9)
4. Node 3: No 3-stars (as it only has one neighbor)
5. Node 4: No 3-stars (as it only has one neighbor)
6. Node 5: (5, 0, 2), (5, 0, 8), (5, 2, 8)
7. Node 6: No 3-stars (as it only has two neighbors)
8. Node 7: No 3-stars (as it only has one neighbor)
9. Node 8: (8, 0, 5), (8, 0, 9), (8, 5, 9), (8, 0, 7), (8, 3, 9)
10. Node 9: (9, 0, 2), (9, 0, 8), (9, 2, 8)

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are:
<0, (5, 8, 9)>
<2, (1, 5, 9)>
<5, (0, 2, 8)>
<8, (0, 5, 9)>
<8, (0, 7, 8)>
<8, (3, 8, 9)>
<9, (0, 2, 8)>

Finally, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
