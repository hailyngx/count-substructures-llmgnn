Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars present.

Given the definition of a 3-star graph, we know that each 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

From the adjacency list and the given edges, we can identify the following 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<0, (1, 6, 8)>
<0, (1, 2, 9)>
<0, (1, 6, 9)>
<0, (2, 3, 6)>
<0, (2, 3, 9)>
<0, (3, 6, 8)>
<0, (3, 9, 8)>
<3, (6, 7, 9)>
<4, (1, 9, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
