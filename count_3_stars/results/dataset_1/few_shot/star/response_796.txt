Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 8

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify sets of nodes where one node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a 3-star pattern.

Based on the information provided, we can see that the nodes and their connections are as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 8.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0 and 6.
- Node 2 is connected to node 7.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 5, 7, and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 7, and 8.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1 and 4.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 5.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 5, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 4 and 8.

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
- <0, (1, 3, 8)>
- <3, (0, 5, 8)>
- <5, (3, 4, 8)>
- <8, (0, 3, 5)>
- <4, (5, 6, 9)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
