Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Looking at the provided adjacency list:
- Node 0 is not a central node for any 3-star.
- Node 1 is not a central node for any 3-star.
- Node 2 is not a central node for any 3-star.
- Node 3 is a central node for the following 3-stars: <3, (0, 4, 5)>, <3, (6, 7, 8)>
- Node 4 is not a central node for any 3-star.
- Node 5 is not a central node for any 3-star.
- Node 6 is not a central node for any 3-star.
- Node 7 is not a central node for any 3-star.
- Node 8 is not a central node for any 3-star.
- Node 9 is not a central node for any 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2], and they are <3, (0, 4, 5)> and <3, (6, 7, 8)>.
