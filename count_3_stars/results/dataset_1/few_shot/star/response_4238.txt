Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each combination of a center node and three leaves connected to it. A 3-star has one center and three leaves.

Observing the given edges and adjacency list, the 3-stars can be identified as follows:

1. <2, (0, 3, 9)>
2. <3, (2, 8, 9)>
3. <7, (1, 4, 6)>
4. <8, (3, 5, 7)>
5. <9, (2, 6, 3)>

Counting the above 3-stars, we find that there are [5] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
