Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 1) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to look for nodes that have exactly three neighbors and form a star shape around them.

There are three 3-stars in the given graph. 

[3] 

<0, (2, 5, 7)>
<1, (3, 7, 9)>
<5, (0, 8, 9)>
