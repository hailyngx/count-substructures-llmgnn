Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars present. 

Let's analyze the graph:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 5, and 6.
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 4, and 6.
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, and 6.
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 6, and 7.
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, and 2.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (2, 5, 6)>
<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<2, (0, 1, 6)>
<5, (0, 6, 7)>
<6, (0, 1, 2)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
