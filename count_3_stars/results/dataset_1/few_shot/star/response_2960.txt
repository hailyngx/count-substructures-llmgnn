Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 3

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph can be counted as follows:

1. Node 0 forms a 3-star with leaves 4, 5.
2. Node 2 forms a 3-star with leaves 5, 9.
3. Node 3 forms a 3-star with leaves 8, 9.
4. Node 5 forms a 3-star with leaves 0, 2.
5. Node 7 forms two 3-stars with leaves 1, 6 and 5, 6.

Therefore, the total number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [5].


Unique 3-star graphs:
<0, (4, 5)>
<2, (5, 9)>
<3, (8, 9)>
<5, (0, 2)>
<7, (1, 6)>
<7, (5, 6)>
