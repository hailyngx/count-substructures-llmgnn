Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, making it the center of a 3-star.

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (2, 3, 6)>
<3, (0, 2, 8)>
<3, (0, 8, 9)>
<3, (2, 4, 9)>
<9, (3, 5, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
