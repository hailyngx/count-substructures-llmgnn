Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 5) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 4

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the given graph.

The central nodes of the 3-stars will be the nodes that have exactly 3 neighbors connected to them. From the given adjacency list:
- Node 0, Node 1, Node 2, and Node 9 are potential central nodes.

Next, for each potential central node, we check if it forms a 3-star with its neighbors:
- For Node 0: <0, (1, 2, 9)> is a 3-star.
- For Node 1: <1, (0, 3, 6)> is a 3-star.
- For Node 2: <2, (0, 3, 6)> is a 3-star.
- For Node 9: <9, (0, 1, 4)> is a 3-star.

Therefore, there are 3 unique 3-stars in the given graph.  
So, the final answer is [3].
