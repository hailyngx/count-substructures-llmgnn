Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star pattern, which consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Looking at the adjacency list for each node, we can identify the following 3-stars:
- <0, (5, 6, 7)>
- <2, (4, 6, 7)>
- <4, (2, 5, 9)>
- <5, (0, 4, 7)>
- <6, (0, 2, 9)>
- <7, (0, 2, 9)>
- <9, (1, 4, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7]. 

<0, (5, 6, 7)>
<2, (4, 6, 7)>
<4, (2, 5, 9)>
<5, (0, 4, 7)>
<6, (0, 2, 9)>
<7, (0, 2, 9)>
<9, (1, 4, 6)>
