Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for nodes that have exactly 3 neighbors. These nodes will act as the centers of the 3-stars.

From the adjacency list, the nodes with 3 neighbors are Node 3 and Node 6.

Now let's list the unique 3-stars in the graph:
<3, (2, 5, 8)>
<3, (5, 1, 8)>
<3, (8, 2, 6)>
<6, (1, 8, 9)>

Count of 3-stars: [4]
