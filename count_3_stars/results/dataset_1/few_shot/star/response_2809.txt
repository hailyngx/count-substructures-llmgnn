Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 2

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars in this graph. Since a 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes, we need to find nodes with three neighbors.

Based on the adjacency list provided, the nodes with three neighbors are:
- Node 0 (connected to nodes 1, 5, 9)
- Node 1 (connected to nodes 0, 5, 9)
- Node 2 (connected to nodes 1, 5, 9)

Next, let's find the 3-stars in the graph. A 3-star is formed when a center node is connected to three other nodes.

Looking at the given edges, we find the following 3-stars:
<0, (1, 5, 9)>
<1, (0, 5, 9)>
<2, (1, 5, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3]. 

The unique 3-stars found are <0, (1, 5, 9)>, <1, (0, 5, 9)>, and <2, (1, 5, 9)>.
