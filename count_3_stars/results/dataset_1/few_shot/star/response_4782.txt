Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 2

Response:
First, we identify the central node and the leaves connected to it. To form a 3-star, the central node must be connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we see that:
- Node 1 is connected to 0, 2, 4, and 9
- Node 7 is connected to 3, 5, and 6

So, we can form 3-stars with node 1 and node 7 as central nodes, and their connected nodes as leaves. 

Thus, the identified 3-stars are:
<1, (0, 2, 4)>
<1, (9, 2, 4)>
<7, (3, 5, 6)>

Counting the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph, we find that there are [3] 3-stars.
