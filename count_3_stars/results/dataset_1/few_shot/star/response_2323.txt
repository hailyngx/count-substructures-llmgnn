Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that has exactly 3 neighbors connected to it. These nodes will act as the centers of the 3-stars. Let's now identify the 3-stars:

1. Node 2: <2, (3, 4, 9)>
2. Node 3: <3, (2, 6, 8)>
3. Node 4: <4, (1, 2, 8)>
4. Node 6: <6, (0, 1, 7)>
5. Node 8: <8, (0, 3, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
