Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes with exactly three neighbors for each node. These central nodes will be part of the 3-stars in the graph.

Central nodes with three neighbors:
- Node 1
- Node 6
- Node 8

Now, let's find the 3-stars in the graph that have these central nodes. 

<1, (3, 6, 7)>
<6, (0, 1, 8)>
<8, (1, 3, 4)>
