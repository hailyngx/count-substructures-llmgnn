Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 7

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are as follows:
<0, (4, 7, 9)>
<1, (3, 8, 9)>
<2, (3, 5, 7)>
<3, (1, 2, 9)>
<4, (0, 9, 7)>
<6, (8)>
<8, (1, 6)>
<9, (1, 3, 4)>
