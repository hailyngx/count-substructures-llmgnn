Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-star subgraphs in the given graph, we need to identify all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify these 3-star subgraphs step by step:

1. Node 0 forms two 3-stars:
   <0, (1, 3, 7)>
   <0, (1, 7, 9)>

2. Node 1 forms one 3-star:
   <1, (0, 8, 9)>

3. Node 4 forms one 3-star:
   <4, (5, 7, 8)>

4. Node 7 forms two 3-stars:
   <7, (0, 4, 9)>
   <7, (4, 5, 6)>

Count of 3-star subgraphs: [6]
