Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 8

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

The possible 3-stars in this graph are:
<1, (6, 3, 7)>
<6, (1, 3, 5)>
<6, (1, 3, 8)>
<6, (3, 5, 8)>
<8, (4, 6, 9)>
<9, (3, 5, 8)>

So the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
