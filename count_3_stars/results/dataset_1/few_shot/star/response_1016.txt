Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify all the unique configurations where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Here are the 3-stars present in the given graph:
[9]
