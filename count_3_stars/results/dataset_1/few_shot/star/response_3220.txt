Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 7

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are:
<0, (1, 6, 9)>
<1, (0, 6, 8)>
<6, (0, 1, 8)>
<7, (2, 3, 9)>

Therefore, there are a total of [4] 3-stars in the graph.
