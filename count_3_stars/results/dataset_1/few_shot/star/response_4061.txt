Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 8
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 8

Response:
The 3-star graphs found in the given graph are as follows:

<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<0, (2, 6, 8)>
<1, (2, 6, 9)>
<1, (6, 7, 8)>
<8, (0, 1, 9)>

Count of 3-star graphs: [5]
