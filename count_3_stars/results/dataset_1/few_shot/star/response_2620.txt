Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will act as the center of the 3-stars. Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 0: (0, 1, 2), (0, 1, 7) [<0, (1, 2, 7)>]
2. Node 1: (1, 0, 2), (1, 0, 4), (1, 0, 9) [<1, (0, 2, 4)>, <1, (0, 2, 9)>]
3. Node 2: (2, 0, 1), (2, 0, 3) [<2, (0, 1, 3)>]
4. Node 3: (3, 2, 4), (3, 2, 8), (3, 2, 9) [<3, (2, 4, 8)>, <3, (2, 4, 9)>]
5. Node 4: (4, 1, 3), (4, 1, 5) [<4, (1, 3, 5)>]
6. Node 6: (6, 2, 8) [<6, (2, 8, 6)>]
7. Node 7: (7, 0, 9) [<7, (0, 9, 7)>]
8. Node 8: (8, 3, 6) [<8, (3, 6, 8)>]
9. Node 9: (9, 1, 3), (9, 1, 7) [<9, (1, 3, 7)>]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
