Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges, forming a 3-star pattern with that node as the center.

In this graph, the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes are: Node 1, Node 2, Node 5, and Node 7.

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in this graph:
<1, (0, 8, 9)>
<2, (3, 5, 7)>
<5, (2, 3, 9)>
<7, (0, 2, 4)>

Count of 3-stars in the graph: [4]
