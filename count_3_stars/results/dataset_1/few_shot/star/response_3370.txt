Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the 3-stars present. 

Let's start by looking at each possible central node and its connections. 
1. For Node 0:
   - <0, (1, 2, 3)>
   - <0, (1, 6, 7)>
   - <0, (1, 7, 8)>
   - <0, (2, 8, 9)>
   [4 unique 3-stars]

2. For Node 1:
   - None, as it is only connected to one node.

3. For Node 2:
   - None, as it is only connected to two nodes.

4. For Node 3:
   - None, as it is only connected to one node.

5. For Node 4:
   - <4, (6, 8, 5)>
   [1 unique 3-star]

6. For Node 5:
   - None, as it is only connected to two nodes.

7. For Node 6:
   - None, as it is only connected to two nodes.

8. For Node 7:
   - None, as it is only connected to two nodes.

9. For Node 8:
   - <8, (2, 9, 0)>
   [1 unique 3-star]

10. For Node 9:
   - None, as it is only connected to two nodes.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
