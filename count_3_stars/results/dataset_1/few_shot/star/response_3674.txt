Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 6, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can identify each 3-star by finding nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

Based on the information provided, the 3-stars in this graph can be identified as follows:

<0, (4, 8, 3)>
<1, (4, 6, 5)>
<2, (3, 7, -)>
<3, (2, 6, 9)>
<4, (0, 1, -)>
<5, (1, -, -)>
<6, (1, 3, 9)>
<7, (2, 9, -)>
<8, (0, 9, -)>
<9, (3, 6, 7)>

Counting the unique 3-stars identified, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
