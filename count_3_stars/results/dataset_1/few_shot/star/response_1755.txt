Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first identify the central nodes and their neighbors based on the definition provided. 

Central nodes in this graph: 0, 1, 2, 4, 9

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 4, 9)>
<1, (0, 2, 9)>
<2, (1, 3, 7)>
<4, (0, 3, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
