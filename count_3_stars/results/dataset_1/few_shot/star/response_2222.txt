Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are as follows:
<0, (2, 3, 8)>
<1, (4, 8, 9)>
<2, (3, 5, 8)>
<3, (2, 8, 9)>
<4, (1, 8, 9)>
<5, (2, 7, 8)>
<7, (5, 8, 9)>

So, the total number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [7].
