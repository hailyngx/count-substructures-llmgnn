Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to understand the definition of a 3-star, which has a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's go through the graph and identify the 3-stars:

1. For Node 0: (0, 1, 8), (0, 2, 3), (0, 9, 4) [<0, (1, 8, 5)>, <0, (2, 3, 7)>, <0, (9, 4, 6)>]
2. For Node 1: (1, 0, 2) [<1, (0, 2, 3)>]
3. For Node 2: (2, 0, 3) [<2, (0, 3, 7)>]
4. For Node 3: (3, 2, 4) [<3, (2, 4, 6)>]
5. For Node 4: (4, 3, 6) [<4, (3, 6, 9)>]
6. For Node 5: No 3-stars
7. For Node 6: (6, 4, 9) [<6, (4, 9, 0)>]
8. For Node 7: No 3-stars
9. For Node 8: No 3-stars
10. For Node 9: (9, 6, 4) [<9, (6, 4, 3)>]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
