Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each possible 3-star configuration. A 3-star has a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Given the graph with 10 nodes and 22 edges, the possible 3-stars can be visualized as follows:
- (0, 8) (8, 0) (4, 8) (8, 4) (6, 8) (8, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7)

So, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].

Unique 3-stars found:
<0, (8, 4, 6)>
<8, (0, 4, 6)>
