Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 2) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 6

Response:
We will look for 3-stars in the given graph. 

Let's start by listing all 3-stars that we can find:

<0, (4, 5)>  
<2, (3, 7, 8)>  
<3, (2, 5)>  

Finally, we count all the unique 3-stars we found to get the total number of 3-stars in the graph:
