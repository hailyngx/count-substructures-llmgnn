Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 0) (4, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 6
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1

Response:
To count the number of 3-star configurations, we look for nodes that have exactly 3 edges emanating from them. These nodes will act as the centers of the 3-stars.

Based on the given information, the nodes that have exactly 3 edges connected to them are nodes 0, 1, 8, and 6.

Let's count the 3-stars with these nodes as centers:
- Node 0: (0, 3, 6), (0, 6, 7) [2]
- Node 1: (1, 6, 8), (1, 8, 9) [2]
- Node 8: (8, 1, 2), (8, 2, 7) [2]
- Node 6: (6, 0, 1), (6, 0, 4) [2]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
  
The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 6, 7)>
<1, (6, 8, 9)>
<8, (1, 2, 7)>
<6, (0, 1, 4)>
