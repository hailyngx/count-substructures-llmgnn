Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 5

Response:
Based on the information provided, the 3-stars in the given graph are as follows:

<1, (0, 4, 5)>
<3, (2, 7, 8)>
<8, (2, 5, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
