Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 7

Response:
At first glance, we can see that there are multiple nodes with three edges connected to them, however, not all fulfill the criteria of a 3-star. To identify the 3-stars in the graph, let's examine each node to see if it is at the center of a 3-star by checking if it has exactly three edges connected to it. 

Given the adjacency list, the nodes that qualify as centers of 3-stars are nodes 0, 1, 5, 7, and 9 since they each have exactly three edges connected to them. Let's list the 3-stars' configurations below and then count them to arrive at the final answer.

<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<1, (0, 7, 9)>
<5, (0, 4, 8)>
<7, (1, 6, 8)>
<9, (1, 3, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
