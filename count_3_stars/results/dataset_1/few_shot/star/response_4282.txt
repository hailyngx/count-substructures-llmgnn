Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 5

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph. 

Based on the definition of a 3-star graph, we need to find nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (5, 7, 8)>
<0, (5, 7, 9)>
<7, (0, 2, 4)>
<7, (0, 4, 8)>

These are the unique 3-star configurations in the given graph. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
