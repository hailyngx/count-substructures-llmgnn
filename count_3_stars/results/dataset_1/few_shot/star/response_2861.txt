Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 4

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph by finding nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

Looking at the adjacency list:
- Node 0 is a 3-star with leaves 2, 4, and 6.
- Node 1 is not a part of any 3-star since it's connected to only 3 nodes and not 4.
- Node 2 is not a part of any 3-star since it's connected to only 3 nodes and not 4.
- Node 3 is not a part of any 3-star since it's connected to only 2 nodes and not 4.
- Node 4 is a 3-star with leaves 0, 6, and 9.
- Node 5 is not a part of any 3-star since it's connected to only 3 nodes and not 4.
- Node 6 is a 3-star with leaves 0, 4, and 5.
- Node 7 is not a part of any 3-star since it's connected to only 2 nodes and not 4.
- Node 8 is not a part of any 3-star since it's connected to only 2 nodes and not 4.
- Node 9 is a 3-star with leaves 0, 2, and 4.

Therefore, the 3-stars in the given graph are:
<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<4, (0, 6, 9)>
<6, (0, 4, 5)>
<9, (0, 2, 4)>

There are 4 unique 3-stars in the graph.  
So, the final answer is [4].
