Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 8

Response:
Starting with node 0:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 6, and 7. <0, (1, 6, 7)>

Moving to node 1:
- Node 1 does not form any 3-star since it only has 2 connections.

Looking at node 2:
- Node 2 does not form any 3-star since it has more than 3 connections.

Checking node 3:
- Node 3 does not form any 3-star since it only has 2 connections.

Investigating node 4:
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 3, and 5. <4, (2, 3, 5)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 8 and 9. <4, (8, 8, 9)>

Moving to node 5:
- Node 5 does not form any 3-star since it only has 3 connections.
 
Checking node 6:
- Node 6 does not form any 3-star since it only has 2 connections.

Looking at node 7:
- Node 7 does not form any 3-star since it only has 1 connection.

Investigating node 8:
- Node 8 does not form any 3-star since it only has 2 connections.

Checking node 9:
- Node 9 does not form any 3-star since it only has 3 connections.

Therefore, there are a total of [2] 3-stars in the given graph.
The unique 3-stars found are: <<0, (1, 6, 7)>, <4, (2, 3, 5)>].
