Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 3

Response:
The given graph contains the following 3-stars:
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<3, (0, 7, 8)>
<4, (0, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
