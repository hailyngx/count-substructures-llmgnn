Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 5, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars, we need to identify all the unique occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. We will use the given information to create a list of all 3-stars in the graph.

Based on the information provided, the 3-stars in the graph are as follows:
<0, (4, 6, 9)>
<1, (8, 9, -)>
<2, (6, 8, -)>
<3, (5, 8, 9)>
<4, (0, 6, 8)>
<5, (3, 8, 9)>
<6, (0, 2, 4)>
<8, (1, 2, 3)>
<9, (0, 1, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
