Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These will be the central nodes of 3-stars. Let's identify them first:

- Node 1 is connected to 3 other nodes: 2, 6, 9
- Node 7 is connected to 3 other nodes: 0, 9, 4
- Node 8 is connected to 3 other nodes: 3, 4, 9

Now, we can count the 3-stars:

- <1, (2, 6, 9)>
- <7, (0, 9, 4)>
- <8, (3, 4, 9)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
