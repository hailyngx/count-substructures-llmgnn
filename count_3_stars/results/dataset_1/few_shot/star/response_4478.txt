Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a 3-star pattern. Below are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

[4]

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1].
