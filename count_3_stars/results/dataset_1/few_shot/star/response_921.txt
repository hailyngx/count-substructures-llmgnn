Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 8

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star structures in the given graph:
- Nodes 0, 1, and 9 form a 3-star: <0, (1, 3, 9)>
- Nodes 1, 2, and 4 form a 3-star: <1, (0, 2, 4)>
- Nodes 2, 7, and 9 form a 3-star: <2, (1, 7, 9)>
- Nodes 3, 4, and 9 form a 3-star: <3, (0, 4, 9)>
- Nodes 4, 6, and 8 form a 3-star: <4, (1, 6, 8)>
- Nodes 5, 6, and 8 form a 3-star: <5, (6, 8, 5)>
- Nodes 7, 2, and 8 form a 3-star: <7, (2, 8, 7)>
- Nodes 8, 5, and 9 form a 3-star: <8, (4, 5, 9)>
- Nodes 8, 7, and 9 form a 3-star: <8, (4, 7, 9)>
- Nodes 9, 0, and 8 form a 3-star: <9, (2, 0, 8)>

Count of 3-stars in the given graph: [9]
