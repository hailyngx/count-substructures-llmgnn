Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 7
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, and node 9

Response:
To count the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph, we need to identify each central node and its connected leaves. 

Let's analyze each node to find the 3-stars:

- Node 0: <0, (1, 4, 5)> (A 3-star)
- Node 1: Not a central node of any 3-star
- Node 2: Not a central node of any 3-star
- Node 3: Not connected to any other nodes
- Node 4: <4, (0, 5, 8)> and <4, (5, 7, 9)> (2 3-stars)
- Node 5: Not a central node of any 3-star
- Node 6: Not a central node of any 3-star
- Node 7: <7, (0, 1, 9)> (A 3-star)
- Node 8: Not a central node of any 3-star
- Node 9: Not a central node of any 3-star

The total number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [3].

Unique 3-stars found: 
<0, (1, 4, 5)>, <4, (0, 5, 8)>, <4, (5, 7, 9)>, <7, (0, 1, 9)>
