Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 6) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 6
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a 3-star pattern.

Checking each node's connections:
- Node 0 has 2 connections.
- Node 1 has 4 connections.
- Node 2 has 4 connections.
- Node 3 has 1 connection.
- Node 4 has 0 connections.
- Node 5 has 1 connection.
- Node 6 has 5 connections.
- Node 7 has 1 connection.
- Node 8 has 2 connections.
- Node 9 has 2 connections.

Since a 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can identify the following 3-stars:
1. <1, (0, 2, 8)>
2. <1, (6, 0, 2)>
3. <2, (1, 6, 8)>
4. <2, (7, 1, 8)>
5. <6, (1, 2, 9)>
6. <6, (3, 5, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
