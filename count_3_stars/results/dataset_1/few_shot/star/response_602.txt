Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 8

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the graph based on the given definition.

Since a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we will look for nodes that have exactly 3 edges connected to them. These nodes will be the centers of the 3-stars.

From the adjacency list, we can see that the nodes with exactly 3 edges are:
- Node 1 (connected to 5 and 7),
- Node 4 (connected to 3 and 6),
- Node 7 (connected to 1 and 8),
- Node 8 (connected to 2 and 7),
- Node 9 (connected to 5, 6, and 8).

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:

<1, (5, 7)>
<4, (3, 6)>
<7, (1, 8)>
<8, (2, 7)>
<9, (5, 6, 8)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
