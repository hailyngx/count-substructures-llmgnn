Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 2
