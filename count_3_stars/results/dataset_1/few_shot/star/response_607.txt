Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 6

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are:
<0, (6, 7, 9)>
<1, (3, 5, 8)>
<2, ()>
<3, (1, 5, 8)>
<4, (6, 9, 5)>
<5, (1, 3, 9)>
<6, (0, 3, 4)>
<7, (0, 3)>
<8, (1, 3)>
<9, (0, 4, 5)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
