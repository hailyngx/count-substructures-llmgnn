Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Check each node to identify any 3-stars:
   - Node 0: <0, (3, 4, 6)>
   - Node 1: <1, (2, 3, 4)>
   - Node 2: <2, (1, 3, 5)>
   - Node 3: No 3-star as it has more than 3 connections.
   - Node 4: No 3-star as it has more than 3 connections.
   - Node 5: No 3-star as it has more than 3 connections.
   - Node 6: <6, (0, 3, 5)>
   - Node 7: No 3-star as it has less than 3 connections.
   - Node 8: No 3-star as it has more than 3 connections.
   - Node 9: No 3-star as it has less than 3 connections.

2. Count the number of unique 3-stars found: [3]

Therefore, the final answer is [3].
Unique 3-stars found: <0, (3, 4, 6)>, <1, (2, 3, 4)>, <6, (0, 3, 5)>
