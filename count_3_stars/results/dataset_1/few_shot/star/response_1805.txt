Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 2
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
The first step is to identify the 3-star configurations in the given graph. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (2, 3, 7)>
<1, (3, 5, -)>
<2, (0, 3, 7)>
<2, (3, 4, 7)>
<3, (0, 1, 7)>
<3, (2, 5, 7)>
<4, (2, 6, -)>
<5, (1, 3, -)>
<6, (3, 4, -)>

Counting the number of 3-stars in the graph, we find that there are [8] 3-stars in total.
