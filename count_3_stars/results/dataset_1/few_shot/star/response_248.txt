Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will identify each unique 3-star by looking for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

Looking at the adjacency list, we can find the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 4.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 6, 9, which does not form a 3-star.

Therefore, there are two unique 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<6, (4, 5, 8)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
