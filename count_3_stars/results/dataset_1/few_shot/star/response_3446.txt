Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2

Response:
Given the graph information provided, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:

There are five nodes each connected to three other nodes: nodes 1, 4, 6, 7, and 8. Let's find the 3-stars centered at these nodes:
1. Node 1: (1, 4, 6), (1, 4, 8), (1, 6, 8), (1, 7, 8) 
2. Node 4: (4, 1, 6), (4, 1, 8), (4, 6, 8) 
3. Node 6: (6, 1, 4), (6, 1, 8), (6, 4, 8) 
4. Node 7: (7, 1, 8) 
5. Node 8: (8, 1, 4), (8, 1, 6), (8, 1, 7), (8, 3, 4), (8, 4, 6), (8, 6, 7)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [13] when considering unique combinations. 

<1, (4, 6, 8)>, <4, (1, 6, 8)>, <6, (1, 4, 8)>, <7, (1, 8)>, <8, (1, 4, 6)>, <8, (3, 4, 6)>
