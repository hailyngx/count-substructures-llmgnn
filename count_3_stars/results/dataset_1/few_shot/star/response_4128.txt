Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 6
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges, forming a 3-star pattern. 

Based on the given information, we can identify the following 3-star patterns:

<1,(2,6,8)>
<2,(0,1,3)>
<2,(1,3,4)>
<2,(3,4,7)>
<3,(2,6,8)>
<6,(1,3,8)>

Counting all unique 3-stars, we find that there are [6] 3-star patterns in the graph.
