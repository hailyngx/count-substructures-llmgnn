Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 7)

Response:
To count the number of 3-star configurations in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern. 

Starting from each node as the potential center of a 3-star, we can check if it is connected to exactly three other nodes. If so, we identify the 3-star pattern and move on to the next node. 

Let's go through each node:
- Node 0: Not a center of a 3-star.
- Node 1: Center of a 3-star: <1, (5, 6, 8)>
- Node 2: Center of a 3-star: <2, (5, 6, 8)>
- Node 3: Not a center of a 3-star.
- Node 4: Not a center of a 3-star.
- Node 5: Not a center of a 3-star.
- Node 6: Not a center of a 3-star.
- Node 7: Center of a 3-star: <7, (3, 4, 8)>
- Node 8: Not a center of a 3-star.
- Node 9: Not a center of a 3-star.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in this graph are: 
<1, (5, 6, 8)>, <2, (5, 6, 8)>, <7, (3, 4, 8)>

There are a total of [3] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
