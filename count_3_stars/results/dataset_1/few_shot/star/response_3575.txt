Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all the 3-stars present in the graph based on the definition provided.

Given the definition of a 3-star graph, we know that each 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. We can identify possible 3-stars by looking at each node as a potential central node and checking if it has exactly three neighbors.

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (3, 8, 2)>
<0, (3, 8, 5)>
<1, (5, 7, 9)>
<2, (3, 7, 9)>
<4, (9, 5, 3)>
<6, (5, 7, 2)>
<8, (0, 3, 9)>

Count of 3-stars in the graph: [7]
