Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 7) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 6

Response:
Step 1: Identify the 3-stars

1. From the adjacency list, find nodes which are connected to exactly 3 other nodes.
   - Node 0, Node 3, Node 6, Node 7, Node 8
      
2. List the 3-stars where these nodes are central nodes:
   - <0, (3, 6, 7)>
   - <3, (0, 8, 9)>
   - <6, (0, 4, 9)>
   - <7, (0, 1, 2)>

Step 2: Count the number of unique 3-stars found
