Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 4, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the possible 3-stars by looking for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

Here are the 3-stars in the graph:
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<3, (0, 4, 9)>
<3, (1, 3, 2)>
<3, (2, 3, 1)>
<3, (4, 3, 5)>
<3, (5, 4, 6)>
<3, (6, 5, 9)>
<3, (9, 0, 6)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
