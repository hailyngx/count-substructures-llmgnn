Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star structure. Remember that a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list the 3-stars present in the given graph:
<0, (2, 5, 8)>
<1, (2, 6, _)> There is no third node connected to node 1 to form a 3-star.
<2, (0, 1, 8)>
<2, (3, 4, _)> There is no third node connected to node 2 to form a 3-star.
<2, (7, 8, _)> There is no third node connected to node 2 to form a 3-star.
<3, (2, 4, 8)>
<4, (2, 3, 9)>
<6, (1, 7, _)> There is no third node connected to node 6 to form a 3-star.
<7, (2, 6, 8)>
<8, (0, 3, 7)>
<9, (3, 4, _)>
<9, (4, 3, _)>

Thus, there are 7 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the final answer is [7].
