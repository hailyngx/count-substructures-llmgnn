Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, and node 8

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all unique instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

In this graph, the central node should have exactly 3 edges connected to it. Let's identify them:

1. Central Node: 2
   - Connected Nodes: 1, 3, 6

2. Central Node: 3
   - Connected Nodes: 2, 5, 7

3. Central Node: 6
   - Connected Nodes: 2, 9 

4. Central Node: 8
   - Connected Nodes: 4, 9 

5. Central Node: 9
   - Connected Nodes: 2, 3, 6

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:

<2, (1, 3, 6)>
<3, (2, 5, 7)>
<6, (2, 9)>
<8, (4, 9)>
<9, (2, 3, 6)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
