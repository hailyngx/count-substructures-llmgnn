This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8)

Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node and its three connected leaves for each 3-star. 

Since a 3-star graph consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can look for nodes with 3 edges originating from them. 

In this graph, the nodes with 3 edges are:
- Node 4 (connected to nodes 5, 8, and 0)
- Node 5 (connected to nodes 0, 2, and 4)

Now, let's find the 3-stars in the graph:
- For Node 4: <4, (5, 8, 0)>
- For Node 5: <5, (0, 2, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2]. 
The unique 3-stars are <4, (5, 8, 0)> and <5, (0, 2, 4)>.
