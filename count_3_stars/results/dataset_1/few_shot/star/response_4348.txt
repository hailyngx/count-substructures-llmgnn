Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars, we need to look for each central node and its connected nodes to form a 3-star pattern.

Let's find the 3-stars:
- For Node 0: (0, 3, 4, 6)
- For Node 2: (2, 3, 4, 5)
- For Node 3: (3, 0, 2, 7)
- For Node 4: (4, 0, 2, 9)

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 4, 6)>
<2, (3, 4, 5)>
<3, (0, 2, 7)>
<4, (0, 2, 9)>
