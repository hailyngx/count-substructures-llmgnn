Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 6, 7, and node 8

Response:
There are two 3-stars in this graph. 
The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (4, 6, 9)>
<1, (6, 7, 9)>
