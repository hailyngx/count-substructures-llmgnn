Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 1

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a star shape.

Let's calculate it step by step:

For each node, find all possible 3-stars by checking if it has exactly three neighbors connected to it:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, possible 3-stars: <1, (3, 6, 7)>.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 9 has 1 neighbor.

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1].

Unique 3-stars in the graph:
<1, (3, 6, 7)>
