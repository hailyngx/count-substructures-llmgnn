Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 6, and node 7

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are as follows:

<0, (5, 7, 8)>
<0, (5, 7, 9)>
<0, (5, 8, 9)>
<1, (2, 4, 5)>
<1, (2, 4, 9)>
<2, (1, 4, 6)>
<2, (1, 4, 8)>
<2, (1, 6, 9)>
<2, (4, 6, 9)>
<6, (2, 3, 8)>
<6, (2, 3, 9)>
<6, (3, 8, 9)>
<7, (0, 4, 9)>
<8, (0, 5, 6)>
<8, (0, 5, 9)>
<8, (0, 6, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 6)>
<9, (0, 1, 7)>
<9, (0, 2, 6)>
<9, (0, 2, 7)>
<9, (0, 6, 7)>
<9, (1, 2, 6)>
<9, (1, 2, 7)>
<9, (1, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [24].
