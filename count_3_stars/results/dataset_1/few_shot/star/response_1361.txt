Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through the nodes one by one:

1. Node 0:
   - Node 0 is connected to nodes 2 and 4. Since it is not connected to exactly three other nodes, it does not form a 3-star.

2. Node 1:
   - Node 1 is connected to node 9. Since it is not connected to exactly three other nodes, it does not form a 3-star.

3. Node 2:
   - Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 6, 7, and 9. Node 2 forms a 3-star <2, (0, 6, 7)>.

4. Node 3:
   - Node 3 is connected to node 4. Since it is not connected to exactly three other nodes, it does not form a 3-star.

5. Node 4:
   - Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 6, and 9. Node 4 forms a 3-star <4, (0, 3, 6)>.

6. Node 5:
   - Node 5 is connected to nodes 6 and 9. Since it is not connected to exactly three other nodes, it does not form a 3-star.

7. Node 6:
   - Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 5, and 8. Node 6 forms a 3-star <6, (2, 4, 8)>.

8. Node 7:
   - Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 8, and 9. Node 7 forms a 3-star <7, (2, 8, 9)>.

9. Node 8:
   - Node 8 is connected to nodes 6, 7, and 9. Node 8 forms a 3-star <8, (6, 7, 9)>.

10. Node 9:
   - Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8. Node 9 forms two 3-stars: <9, (1, 2, 4)> and <9, (5, 7, 8)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
Unique 3-stars: <2, (0, 6, 7)>, <4, (0, 3, 6)>, <6, (2, 4, 8)>, <7, (2, 8, 9)>, <8, (6, 7, 9)>.
