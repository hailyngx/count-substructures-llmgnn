Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for each node that has exactly 3 neighbors connected to it, forming a 3-star. Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<1, (0, 5, 8)>
<2, (0, 5, 8)>
<3, (1, 4, 7)>
<4, (3, 6, 7)>
<5, (0, 1, 2)>
<6, (4, 7, 9)>
<7, (1, 4, 6)>
<8, (0, 1, 5)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars found: [9]
