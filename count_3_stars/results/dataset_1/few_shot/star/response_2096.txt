Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 8

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are as follows:

<0, (5, 8, 0)>
<2, (4, 7, 8)>
<2, (7, 3, 9)>
<4, (2, 6, 4)>
<5, (0, 7, 5)>
<6, (4, 7, 8)>
<7, (2, 5, 7)>
<8, (0, 6, 8)>
<9, (2, 8, 9)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
