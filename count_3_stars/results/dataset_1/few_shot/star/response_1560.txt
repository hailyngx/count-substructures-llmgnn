Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a center node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list all the unique 3-stars present in the graph:

<0, (6, 7, 0)>
<1, (3, 4, 7)>
<1, (4, 2, 1)>
<1, (7, 8, 1)>
<1, (9, 4, 1)>
<2, (4, 6, 2)>
<4, (2, 5, 4)>
<4, (5, 6, 4)>
<5, (4, 9, 5)>
<6, (0, 2, 6)>
<7, (0, 8, 7)>
<8, (3, 5, 8)>
<8, (5, 6, 8)>
<9, (1, 5, 9)>
<9, (4, 7, 9)>
<9, (6, 5, 9)>

Counting all these unique 3-stars, we find that there are [16] 3-stars in total.
