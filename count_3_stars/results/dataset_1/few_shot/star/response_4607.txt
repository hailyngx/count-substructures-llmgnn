Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 8

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 9, forming the 3-star <0, (3, 4, 9)>.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 6, forming the 3-star <3, (0, 2, 6)>.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0 and 8, but it does not form a 3-star as it has only 2 neighbors.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1 and 6, but it does not form a 3-star as it has only 2 neighbors.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 4 and 9, but it does not form a 3-star as it has only 2 neighbors.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0 and 8, but it does not form a 3-star as it has only 2 neighbors.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2]. 
<0, (3, 4, 9)>, <3, (0, 2, 6)>
