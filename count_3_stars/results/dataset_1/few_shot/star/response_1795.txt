Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for each node that is the center of a 3-star. 

Starting with Node 0:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 6. This forms one 3-star: <0, (3, 5, 6)>. 

Moving on to Node 1:
- Node 1 is connected only to Node 9. Since there is no 3-star centered at Node 1, we don't count any additional 3-stars.

Next, Node 2:
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 6, 7, and 8. This forms one 3-star: <2, (4, 6, 8)>.

Then, Node 3:
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 8, and 9. This forms one 3-star: <3, (0, 8, 9)>.

Moving to Node 4:
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 6, and 9. This forms one 3-star: <4, (2, 5, 9)>.

Then, Node 5:
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 6, and 8. This forms one 3-star: <5, (0, 4, 6)>.

Next, Node 6:
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, 5, and 9. This forms two 3-stars: <6, (0, 4, 9)> and <6, (2, 4, 5)>.

Moving on to Node 7:
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2 and 8. Since there is no 3-star centered at Node 7, we don't count any additional 3-stars.

Then, Node 8:
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 5, 7, and 9. This forms one 3-star: <8, (2, 5, 9)>.

Finally, Node 9:
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, 6, and 8. This forms two 3-stars: <9, (1, 4, 8)> and <9, (3, 4, 6)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (3, 5, 6)>, <2, (4, 6, 8)>, <3, (0, 8, 9)>, <4, (2, 5, 9)>, <5, (0, 4, 6)>, <6, (0, 4, 9)>, <6, (2, 4, 5)>, <8, (2, 5, 9)>, <9, (1, 4, 8)>, <9, (3, 4, 6)>.
