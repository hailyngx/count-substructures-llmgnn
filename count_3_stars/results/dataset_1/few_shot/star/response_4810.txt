Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 3

Response:
To count the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph, we need to identify the central node and its adjacent nodes for each 3-star.

Upon analyzing the adjacency list, we can determine the 3-star graphs as follows:

<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<0, (1, 5, 9)>
<2, (3, 7, 9)>
<3, (2, 5, 9)>
<5, (0, 3, 7)>
<9, (0, 2, 3)>

Therefore, there are [6] 3-star graphs in the given graph.
