Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star configuration. Note that for a 3-star, the central node is connected to exactly three outer nodes.

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (2, 3, 7)>
<2, (0, 5, 6)>
<3, (0, 5, 8)>
<5, (2, 3, 6)>
<6, (2, 5, 9)>
<9, (4, 5, 6)>

Counting all the unique 3-stars in the given graph, we find a total of [6] 3-stars.
