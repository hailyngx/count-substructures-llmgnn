Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star configuration, which consists of a central node and three leaves connected to it. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<0, (1, 5, 9)>
<1, (0, 2, 5)>
<1, (2, 5, 7)>
<2, (1, 4, 5)>
<2, (4, 5, 9)>
<4, (2, 5, 9)>
<4, (5, 6, 9)>

By listing the unique 3-stars in the graph, we can see that there are a total of [8] 3-stars.
