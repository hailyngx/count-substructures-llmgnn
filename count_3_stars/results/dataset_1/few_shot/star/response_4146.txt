Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Based on the given information, we can identify the following 3-stars:
1. <4, (0, 1, 2)>
2. <5, (2, 3, 7)>
3. <9, (2, 7, 8)>

Count of 3-stars: [3]
