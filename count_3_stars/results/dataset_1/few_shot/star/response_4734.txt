Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 8

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the given graph:
- From the adjacency list, we can see that the central nodes which could potentially form 3-stars are nodes 0, 1, 4, 7, and 8.

Next, we will verify each potential 3-star by checking if they have exactly 3 leaves connected to the central node. Let's go through each potential central node:
- Node 0: (0, 3, 4, 8) - Does not form a 3-star as it has 4 leaves.
- Node 1: (1, 4, 7) - Forms a 3-star.
- Node 4: (4, 0, 1, 6) - Does not form a 3-star as it has 4 leaves.
- Node 7: (7, 1, 2, 5, 8, 9) - Does not form a 3-star as it has 6 leaves.
- Node 8: (8, 0, 7, 9) - Forms a 3-star.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are:
<1, (4, 7, 8)>
The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
