Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find the unique occurrences where a node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes by edges. Let's identify the 3-stars present in the graph step by step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 6, 7, and 9. This forms a 3-star with the center node 0 and leaves 6, 7, 9. 
   <0, (6, 7, 9)>

2. Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 7, and 9. This forms a 3-star with the center node 3 and leaves 2, 7, 9.
   <3, (2, 7, 9)>

3. Node 5 is connected to nodes 2 and 8. However, since it is not a 3-star configuration, it is not considered.

4. Node 6 is connected to nodes 0 and 9. However, it does not form a 3-star configuration since it has only 2 connections.
   
5. Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, and 9. This forms two 3-star configurations:
   <7, (0, 3, 9)>
   <7, (4, 3, 9)>

6. Node 8 is connected to nodes 5 and 9. However, it does not form a 3-star configuration since it has only 2 connections.

7. Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 6, 7, and 8. This forms a 3-star with the center node 9 and leaves 0, 6, 7.
   <9, (0, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].  
[4]
