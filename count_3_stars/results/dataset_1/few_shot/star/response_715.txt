Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 8

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph.

Since a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Upon examining the adjacency list for each node, we can see that the nodes 1 and 9 are connected to exactly 3 other nodes. This means we have two 3-stars in the graph:
<1, (2, 3, 5)>
<9, (0, 1, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
