Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern centered at that node.

Examining the given graph and its adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-star patterns:
<1, (6, 8, 0)>
<6, (1, 9, 8)>
<8, (0, 1, 3)>
<9, (2, 4, 6)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
