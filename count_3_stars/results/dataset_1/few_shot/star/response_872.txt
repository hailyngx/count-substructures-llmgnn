Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list all the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (2, 6, 7)>
<1, (3, 5, 6)>
<2, (0, 4, 7)>
<3, (1, 6, 7)>
<4, (2, 7, 8)>
<5, (1, 6, 8)>
<6, (0, 3, 5)>
<7, (2, 4, 6)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the given graph: [8].
