Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 4

Response:
Let's start by identifying the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 6 <0, (1, 6)>
2. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 5, 6 <1, (0, 5, 6)>
3. Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 6, 8 <7, (5, 6, 8)>
4. Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 7, 9 <8, (2, 7, 9)>
5. Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 4, 8 <9, (3, 4, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5]. 
The unique 3-stars are <0, (1, 6)>, <1, (0, 5, 6)>, <7, (5, 6, 8)>, <8, (2, 7, 9)>, <9, (3, 4, 8)>.
