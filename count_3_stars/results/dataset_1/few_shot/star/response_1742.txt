Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node:

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes represent the centers of potential 3-stars. 

Let's go through the nodes one by one:

- Node 0: Not a center of a 3-star since it's connected to only one node.
- Node 1: Not a center of a 3-star since it's connected to four nodes.
- Node 2: Potential center of a 3-star, connected to exactly three nodes: 1, 3, and 5.
  <2, (1, 3, 5)>
- Node 3: Not a center of a 3-star since it's connected to only two nodes.
- Node 4: Not a center of a 3-star since it's connected to only two nodes.
- Node 5: Potential center of a 3-star, connected to exactly three nodes: 2, 7, and 9.
  <5, (2, 7, 9)>
- Node 6: Not a center of a 3-star since it's connected to five nodes.
- Node 7: Not a center of a 3-star since it's connected to only two nodes.
- Node 8: Not a center of a 3-star since it's connected to four nodes.
- Node 9: Potential center of a 3-star, connected to exactly three nodes: 5, 6, and 8. 
  <9, (5, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3]. 
The unique 3-stars are <2, (1, 3, 5)>, <5, (2, 7, 9)>, and <9, (5, 6, 8)>.
