Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (4, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 5
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 6

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0 forms a 3-star: <0, (6, 7)>
2. Node 2 forms a 3-star: <2, (1, 6, 7)>
3. Node 6 forms a 3-star: <6, (0, 2, 3)> and <6, (0, 4, 9)>
4. Node 7 forms a 3-star: <7, (0, 2, 5)>

Count of 3-stars: [4]
