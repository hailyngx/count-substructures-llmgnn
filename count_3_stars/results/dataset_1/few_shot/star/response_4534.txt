Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for nodes in the graph that are connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern around them. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars in the graph: 

<1, (2, 5, 8)>
<2, (1, 6, 7)>
<9, (2, 5, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
