Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 6

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars present.

Based on the definition given, a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's examine the graph:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges:
(0, 5) (0, 8)
(1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8)
(2, 7) (2, 9)
(3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6)
(4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9)
(5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8)
(6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9)
(7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8)
(8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7)
(9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6)

Let's list the unique 3-stars:
<0, (5, 8, 1)>
<1, (5, 6, 7)>
<2, (7, 9, 4)>
<3, (4, 5, 6)>
<4, (3, 5, 6)>
<5, (0, 1, 3)> 
<6, (1, 3, 4)>
<7, (1, 2, 4)>
<8, (0, 1, 5)>
<9, (2, 4, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
