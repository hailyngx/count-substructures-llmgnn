Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 8

Response:
Initially, we identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 

Starting from Node 0: 
- Node 0, 7, 2 form a 3-star. <0, (7, 2, 7)>
- Node 0, 7, 2 form another 3-star. <0, (7, 2, 9)>

Moving to Node 1: 
- Node 1 doesn't have any 3-stars.

Looking at Node 2: 
- Node 2, 3, 8 form a 3-star. <2, (3, 8, 3)>
- Node 2, 5, 9 form a 3-star. <2, (5, 9, 1)>
- Node 2, 7, 0 form a 3-star. <2, (7, 0, 2)>

Node 3: 
- Node 3 doesn't have any 3-stars.

Node 4: 
- Node 4 doesn't have any 3-stars.

Node 5: 
- Node 5, 2, 9 form a 3-star. <5, (2, 9, 1)>
- Node 5, 9, 8 form a 3-star. <5, (9, 8, 3)>

Node 6: 
- Node 6 doesn't have any 3-stars.

Node 7: 
- Node 7 doesn't have any 3-stars.

Node 8: 
- Node 8 doesn't have any 3-stars.

Node 9: 
- Node 9, 1, 4 form a 3-star. <9, (1, 4, 1)>
- Node 9, 2, 5 form a 3-star. <9, (2, 5, 9)>
- Node 9, 8, 3 form a 3-star. <9, (8, 3, 8)>

Overall, the 3-stars found are: 
<0, (7, 2, 7)>, <0, (7, 2, 9)>, <2, (3, 8, 3)>, <2, (5, 9, 1)>, <2, (7, 0, 2)>, <5, (2, 9, 1)>, <5, (9, 8, 3)>, <9, (1, 4, 1)>, <9, (2, 5, 9)>, <9, (8, 3, 8)>

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: [10]
