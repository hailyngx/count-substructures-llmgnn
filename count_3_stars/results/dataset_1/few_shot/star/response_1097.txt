Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (5, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star-like pattern.

Looking at the given graph and adjacency list, we can observe the following 3-stars:
<0, (3, 9)>
<3, (0, 7, 9)>
<6, (8, 9)>
<8, (2, 6)>
<9, (0, 3, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
