Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 7

Response:
Based on the given information, the 3-star graphs in the given graph are as follows:

<0, (6, 7, 9)>
<1, (3, 7, 5)>
<3, (1, 7, 5)>
<4, (7, 8, -)>
<6, (0, 8, 9)>
<7, (0, 1, 9)>
<8, (4, 6, -)>
<9, (0, 6, 7)>

Count of 3-star graphs: [8]
