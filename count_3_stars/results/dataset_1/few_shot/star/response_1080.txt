Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 3

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star pattern. Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<1, (2, 8, 6)>
<2, (1, 3, 6)>
<3, (2, 5, 6)>
<4, (5, 6, 4)>
<5, (6, 3, 4)>
<6, (0, 2, 3)>
<7, (2, 8, 7)>
<8, (1, 6, 7)>
<9, (3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
