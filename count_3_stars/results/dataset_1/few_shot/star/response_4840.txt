Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 3

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star patterns in the given graph:

<Node 0, (4, 5, 9)>
<Node 1, (2, 3, 4)>
<Node 1, (2, 4, 9)>
<Node 3, (1, 5, 9)>
<Node 3, (5, 7, 9)>
<Node 3, (5, 7, 8)>
<Node 4, (0, 1, 8)>
<Node 5, (0, 2, 7)>

Count of 3-stars in the graph: [8]
