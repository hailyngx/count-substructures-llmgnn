Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 5

Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 8

Response:
First, we count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.
To count the 3-stars, we look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will be the centers of our 3-stars.

From the adjacency list:
- Node 0 is connected to 3 other nodes (2, 3, 5).
- Node 8 is connected to 3 other nodes (4, 5, 9).

So, we have identified 2 possible 3-star centers.

Let's check the 3-stars for each of these center nodes to make sure they fit the definition.
For Node 0:
- (0, 2, 3, 5)
  This forms a 3-star because Node 0 is connected to exactly three other nodes.
- (0, 2, 5, 6)
  This does not form a 3-star because Node 0 is connected to 4 other nodes.

For Node 8:
- (8, 4, 5, 9)
  This forms a 3-star because Node 8 is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 3, 5)>
<8, (4, 5, 9)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
