Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 8

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that can serve as centers of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 6 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars centered at each of these nodes:
- For node 0, there are 6 * (6-1) / 2 = 15 ways to choose two neighbors, giving us 15 3-stars with node 0 as the center.
- For node 3, there are 4 * (4-1) / 2 = 6 ways to choose two neighbors, giving us 6 3-stars with node 3 as the center.
- For node 4, there are 3 * (3-1) / 2 = 3 ways to choose two neighbors, giving us 3 3-stars with node 4 as the center.
- For node 7, there are 4 * (4-1) / 2 = 6 ways to choose two neighbors, giving us 6 3-stars with node 7 as the center.

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15 + 6 + 3 + 6] = 30.

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<0, (3, 5, 7)>
<0, (3, 7, 8)>
<0, (4, 5, 7)>
<0, (4, 7, 8)>
<3, (1, 6, 7)>
<3, (6, 7, 9)>
<4, (1, 9, 7)>
<7, (5, 0, 9)>
<7, (5, 7, 9)>
<7, (0, 8, 9)>
