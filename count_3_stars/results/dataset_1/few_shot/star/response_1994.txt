Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 6
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 6, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the unique sets of 3 nodes that form a 3-star pattern around a central node.

Since a 3-star graph has a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can look for nodes that have exactly three connections to other nodes in the provided adjacency list.

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<1, (0, 4, 6)>
<4, (0, 1, 3)>
<6, (1, 4, 8)>
<8, (4, 6, 9)>
<9, (4, 7, 8)>

Counting the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we have found 6 unique 3-stars. Therefore, the final answer is [6].
