Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 1

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that have exactly three neighbors. These nodes will serve as the center of the 3-star, connected to the other three nodes (leaves). 

From the adjacency list provided, we can identify the 3-stars:

<0, (3, 5, 7)>
<1, (4, 9, None)>
<2, (3, 4, 6)>
<4, (1, 2, 5)>
<5, (0, 4, 8)>

Therefore, there are [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
