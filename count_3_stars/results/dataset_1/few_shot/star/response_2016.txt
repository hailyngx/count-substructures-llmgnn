Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern. 

In a 3-star, the center node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:
1. <0, (3, 7, 1)> 
2. <2, (4, 6, 8)>
3. <3, (0, 6, 9)>
4. <6, (2, 3, 9)>
5. <7, (0, 3, 8)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
