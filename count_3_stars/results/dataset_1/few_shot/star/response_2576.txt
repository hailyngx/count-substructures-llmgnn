Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 4) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 2

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are as follows:
<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<3, (0, 1, 6)>
<4, (0, 1, 7)>
