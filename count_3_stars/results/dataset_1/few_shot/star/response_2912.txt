Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 3
