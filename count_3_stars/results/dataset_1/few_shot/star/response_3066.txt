Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a 3-star pattern. 

Analyzing the information provided:
- Node 1 seems to be connected to 4 other nodes: 3, 6, 7, and 8, creating 4 possible 3-stars: <1, (3, 6, 7)>, <1, (3, 6, 8)>, <1, (3, 7, 8)>, and <1, (6, 7, 8)>.
- Node 3 seems to be connected to 5 other nodes: 1, 4, 5, 6, and 8, creating 10 possible 3-stars: <3, (1, 4, 5)>, <3, (1, 4, 6)>, <3, (1, 4, 8)>, <3, (1, 5, 6)>, <3, (1, 5, 8)>, <3, (1, 6, 8)>, <3, (4, 5, 6)>, <3, (4, 5, 8)>, <3, (4, 6, 8)>, and <3, (5, 6, 8)>.
- Node 7 seems to be connected to 3 other nodes: 1, 8, and 9, creating 1 possible 3-star: <7, (1, 8, 9)>.
- Node 8 seems to be connected to 5 other nodes: 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7, creating 10 possible 3-stars: <8, (1, 2, 3)>, <8, (1, 2, 5)>, <8, (1, 2, 7)>, <8, (1, 3, 5)>, <8, (1, 3, 7)>, <8, (1, 5, 7)>, <8, (2, 3, 5)>, <8, (2, 3, 7)>, <8, (2, 5, 7)>, and <8, (3, 5, 7)>.
- Node 9 seems to be connected to 3 other nodes: 1, 3, and 4, creating 1 possible 3-star: <9, (1, 3, 4)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is: [4 (from node 1) + 10 (from node 3) + 1 (from node 7) + 10 (from node 8) + 1 (from node 9) = 26].

<1, (3, 6, 7)>, <1, (3, 6, 8)>, <1, (3, 7, 8)>, <1, (6, 7, 8)>, <3, (1, 4, 5)>, <3, (1, 4, 6)>, <3, (1, 4, 8)>, <3, (1, 5, 6)>, <3, (1, 5, 8)>, <3, (1, 6, 8)>, <3, (4, 5, 6)>, <3, (4, 5, 8)>, <3, (4, 6, 8)>, <3, (5, 6, 8)>, <7, (1, 8, 9)>, <8, (1, 2, 3)>, <8, (1, 2, 5)>, <8, (1, 2, 7)>, <8, (1, 3, 5)>, <8, (1, 3, 7)>, <8, (1, 5, 7)>, <8, (2, 3, 5)>, <8, (2, 3, 7)>, <8, (2, 5, 7)>, <8, (3, 5, 7)>, <9, (1, 3, 4)>.

Therefore, the final answer is: [26].
