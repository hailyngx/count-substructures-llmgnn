Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 7

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are:

<0, (3, 7, 9)>
<3, (0, 6, 8)>
<6, (3, 5, 7)>
<7, (0, 3, 9)>

Counting all unique 3-stars, we get a total of [4].
