Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, 7, and node 8

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

Starting with Node 0:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1 and 4.
  - <0, (1, 4)>
  
Moving on to Node 1:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0 and 7. 
  - <1, (0, 7)>
  
Continuing to Node 2:
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 5 and 9.
  - <2, (5, 9)>
  
Next is Node 3:
- Node 3 is connected to node 4. 
  - No 3-star since it is not connected to exactly 3 other nodes.
  
Moving on to Node 4:
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 9.
  - <4, (0, 3, 9)>
  
Proceeding to Node 5:
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2 and 6.
  - No 3-star since it is not connected to exactly 3 other nodes.
  
Moving to Node 6:
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 5 and 9. 
  - No 3-star since it is not connected to exactly 3 other nodes.
  
Continuing to Node 7:
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1 and 9.
  - <7, (1, 9)>
  
Next is Node 8:
- Node 8 is connected to node 9.
  - No 3-star since it is not connected to exactly 3 other nodes.
  
Lastly, Node 9:
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 6, 7, and 8.
  - <9, (2, 4, 6)>
  - <9, (2, 7, 8)>
  - <9, (4, 6, 7)>
  - <9, (4, 7, 8)>
  - <9, (6, 7, 8)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars: [7]
