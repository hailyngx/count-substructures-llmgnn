Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 7) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 5) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 1

Response:
The central nodes for the 3-stars can be any nodes with a degree of 3. Let's list the unique 3-stars: 

<0, (5, 7, 8)>
<1, (4, 7, 9)>
<5, (0, 7, 8)>
<7, (0, 1, 5)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we find that there are [4] 3-stars in total.
