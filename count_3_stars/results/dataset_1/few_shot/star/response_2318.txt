Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Based on the adjacency list provided, the only node that fits this criteria is Node 1.

Node 1 is connected to 7 other nodes (Node 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8), but we are interested in the cases where it is connected to exactly three other nodes. By examining the connections of Node 1:
- Node 1 is connected to Node 0, 2, and 3, forming a 3-star <1, (0, 2, 3)>.
- Node 1 is connected to Node 0, 4, and 5, forming a 3-star <1, (0, 4, 5)>.
- Node 1 is connected to Node 0, 6, and 8, forming a 3-star <1, (0, 6, 8)>.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
The unique 3-stars are <1, (0, 2, 3)>, <1, (0, 4, 5)>, and <1, (0, 6, 8)>.
