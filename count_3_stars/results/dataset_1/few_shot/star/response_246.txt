Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 6) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 3
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 6, and node 8

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:
<0, (3, 6, 7)>
<3, (0, 1, 4)>
<6, (0, 4, 8)>
<6, (8, 9, 0)>
<6, (4, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
