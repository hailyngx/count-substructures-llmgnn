Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first identify the 3-star structures present. 

There are two 3-stars in this graph. 

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (6, 7, 8)>
<1, (6, 9, -)>
