Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify sets of nodes that form 3-stars. Remember that a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's go through the nodes one by one:

1. Node 0: (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6) -> <0, (3, 4, 5)>
2. Node 1: (1, 4), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 9) -> <1, (4, 6, 7)> and <1, (4, 6, 9)>
3. Node 2: (2, 4), (2, 9) -> No 3-star
4. Node 3: (3, 0) -> No 3-star
5. Node 4: (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 8) -> <4, (0, 1, 2)>
6. Node 5: (5, 0), (5, 4), (5, 8), (5, 9) -> <5, (0, 4, 8)>
7. Node 6: (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 4), (6, 7) -> <6, (0, 1, 4)>
8. Node 7: (7, 1), (7, 6) -> No 3-star
9. Node 8: (8, 4), (8, 5) -> No 3-star
10. Node 9: (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 5) -> No 3-star

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are: 
<0, (3, 4, 5)>, <1, (4, 6, 7)>, <1, (4, 6, 9)>, <4, (0, 1, 2)>, <5, (0, 4, 8)>, and <6, (0, 1, 4)>.

Counting the number of unique 3-stars gives us a total of [6].
