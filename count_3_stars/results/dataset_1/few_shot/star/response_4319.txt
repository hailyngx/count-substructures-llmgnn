Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 4
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 3

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the graph. 
From the adjacency list, we can see that nodes 0, 1, and 3 are central nodes connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Next, let's find the 3-stars in the graph: 
1. For central node 0: <0, (1, 3, 4)>
2. For central node 1: <1, (0, 3, 6)>
3. For central node 3: <3, (0, 1, 6)> and <3, (2, 4, 9)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
