Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 6

Response:
The given graph can be described as follows:

```
0 --- 7
|     |
|     |
7 --- 1 --- 3
|     |     |
|     |     |
2 --- 5 --- 4 --- 8
|     |     |
|     |     |
6 --- 9
```

To count the number of 3-stars, we need to find all instances where a node has exactly 3 neighbors forming a star around it.

Let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<1, (3, 5, 7)>
<4, (5, 8, 9)>

The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
