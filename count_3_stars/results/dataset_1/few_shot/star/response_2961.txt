Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 3

Response:
To count the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's go through each node to identify the 3-stars:

1. Node 0: Not a 3-star.
2. Node 1: Not a 3-star.
3. Node 2: Not connected to any other nodes.
4. Node 3: 
   - <3, (4, 6, 9)>
5. Node 4: 
   - <4, (1, 3, 8)>
   - <4, (3, 5, 8)>
6. Node 5: Not a 3-star.
7. Node 6: Not a 3-star.
8. Node 7: Not a 3-star.
9. Node 8: 
   - <8, (0, 1, 4)>
10. Node 9: Not a 3-star.

The unique 3-stars found are: <3, (4, 6, 9)>, <4, (1, 3, 8)>, and <4, (3, 5, 8)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
