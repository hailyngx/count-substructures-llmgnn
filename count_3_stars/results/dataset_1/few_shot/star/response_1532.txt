Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 6

Response:
We can find 3-stars by identifying the central nodes and their adjacent nodes. Let's go through each node to see if it forms a 3-star:

- Node 0: (0, 5, 7) - forms a 3-star
- Node 1: (1, 2, 4), (1, 2, 5) - forms two 3-stars
- Node 2: (2, 1, 3), (2, 1, 6), (2, 1, 9) - forms three 3-stars
- Node 3: (3, 2, 5) - forms a 3-star
- Node 4: (4, 1, 5) - forms a 3-star
- Node 5: (5, 0, 1), (5, 0, 3) - forms two 3-stars
- Node 6: (6, 2, 9) - forms a 3-star
- Node 7: (7, 0, 8) - forms a 3-star
- Node 8: No 3-star formed
- Node 9: (9, 2, 6) - forms a 3-star

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are:
<0, (5, 7)>
<1, (2, 4, 5)>
<2, (1, 3, 6)>
<2, (1, 6, 9)>
<2, (1, 3, 9)>
<3, (2, 5)>
<4, (1, 5)>
<5, (0, 1)>
<5, (0, 3)>
<6, (2, 9)>
<7, (0, 8)>
<9, (2, 6)>

There are [12] 3-stars in the given graph.
