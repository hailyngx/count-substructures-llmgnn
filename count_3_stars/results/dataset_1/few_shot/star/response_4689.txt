Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all occurrences where a node has exactly three edges connecting it to other nodes. In this case, we are looking for nodes with 3 outgoing edges (leaves) connected to them. Let's do this step-by-step.

1. Nodes with 3 outgoing edges:
   - Node 1 has 6 outgoing edges: (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 8)
   - Node 5 has 4 outgoing edges: (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 6)
   - Node 6 has 4 outgoing edges: (6, 1), (6, 5), (6, 7), (6, 9)

2. Identify the 3-star configurations:
   - <1, (2, 4, 6)>
   - <5, (1, 2, 4)>
   - <6, (1, 5, 7)>

So the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<5, (1, 2, 4)>
<6, (1, 5, 7)>
