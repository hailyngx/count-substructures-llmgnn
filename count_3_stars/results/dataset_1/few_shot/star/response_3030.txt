Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 8

Response:
Let's first identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 4, and 6
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 3, and 7
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, and 4
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 2, and 9
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 5, and 7

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the given graph. 

<0, (3, 4, 6)>
<1, (2, 3, 7)>
<3, (0, 1, 4)>
<4, (0, 2, 9)>
<8, (0, 5, 7)>

Total number of 3-stars: [5]
