Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we'll look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will be the centers of the 3-stars. Then we'll find the combinations of three nodes that are connected to each center node, which will represent the 3-stars. 

Given the adjacency list, following are the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<0, (1, 2, 7)>
<0, (1, 3, 7)>
<0, (2, 3, 7)>
<3, (0, 6, 7)>
<4, (1, 6, 7)>
<7, (0, 4, 6)>
<7, (2, 6, 8)>

Count of 3-stars: [8]
