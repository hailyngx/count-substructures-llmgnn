Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each possible 3-star structure based on the definition provided (a central node connected to exactly three other nodes).

Looking at the adjacency list for each node and the edges given, we can list down all the 3-stars in the graph. After analyzing the connections, the 3-star structures present are as follows:

<4, (0, 1, 2)>
<4, (0, 2, 3)>
<4, (0, 5, 6)>
<4, (1, 5, 7)>
<4, (3, 5, 7)>
<4, (5, 6, 9)>

Now we can count the total number of 3-stars in the graph:
