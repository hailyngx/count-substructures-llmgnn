Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, and node 9

Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 7

Response:
The first step is to identify the 3-star structures in the given graph. 
A 3-star is made up of a central node and three other nodes connected to the central node. Since the graph has 10 nodes, we need to check each node to see if it is a central node of a 3-star.

Let's consider each node in the graph:

- Node 0: (0, 2, 5, 6), <0, (2, 5, 6)>
- Node 1: (1, 3, 6), <1, (3, 6, 8)>
- Node 2: (2, 0, 4, 5), <2, (0, 4, 5)>
- Node 3: (3, 1, 4, 5), <3, (1, 4, 5)>
- Node 4: (4, 2, 3, 7, 8), <4, (2, 3, 8)>
- Node 5: (5, 0, 2, 3, 7), <5, (0, 2, 3)>
- Node 6: (6, 0, 1, 3, 7), <6, (0, 1, 3)>
- Node 7: (7, 4, 5, 6, 8), <7, (4, 5, 8)>
- Node 8: (8, 1, 2, 4, 7), <8, (1, 2, 4)>
- Node 9: (9, 0, 4, 7), <9, (0, 4, 7)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [<0, (2, 5, 6)>, <1, (3, 6, 8)>, <2, (0, 4, 5)>, <3, (1, 4, 5)>, <4, (2, 3, 8)>, <5, (0, 2, 3)>, <6, (0, 1, 3)>, <7, (4, 5, 8)>, <8, (1, 2, 4)>, <9, (0, 4, 7)>].
