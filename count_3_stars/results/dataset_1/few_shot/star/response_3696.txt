Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star pattern. A 3-star pattern consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the provided information, we can identify the following unique 3-stars:
<0, (5, 6, 7)>
<1, (2, 7, 8)>
<3, (4, 6, 9)>
<4, (3, 5, 8)>
<5, (0, 4, 9)>
<6, (0, 3)>
<7, (0, 1)>
<8, (1, 2, 4)>
<9, (4, 5)>

To get the total number of 3-stars in the graph, we count the number of unique 3-stars: [9].
