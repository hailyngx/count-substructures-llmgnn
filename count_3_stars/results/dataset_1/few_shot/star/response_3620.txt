Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Looking at the adjacency list, we can identify the following unique 3-stars:
<1, (2, 6, 9)>
<2, (1, 5, 7)>
<3, (7, 9, 5)>
<4, (0, 8, -)>
<5, (2, 9, -)>
<6, (1, 9, -)>
<7, (2, 3, -)>
<8, (4, -, -)>
<9, (3, 5, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
