Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the 3-stars by finding nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

The possible 3-stars in the graph are:
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<1, (2, 4, 8)>
<1, (2, 4, 9)>
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<2, (1, 3, 6)>
<4, (0, 1, 6)>
<5, (0, 3, 6)>
<6, (2, 4, 5)>
<6, (4, 5, 8)>
<6, (4, 5, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
