Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each possible 3-star. Let's start by examining each node to see if it serves as the central node of a 3-star.

Starting from Node 0:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 5, 7, and 9. This forms a 3-star: <0, (5, 7, 9)>.

Moving on to Node 1:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2 and 6. It doesn't form a 3-star as it only has two connections.

Moving on to Node 2:
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 6, 8, and 9. This forms another 3-star: <2, (1, 8, 9)>.

Moving on to Node 3:
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 4 and 9. It doesn't form a 3-star as it only has two connections.

Moving on to Node 4:
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 7, and 8. This forms another 3-star: <4, (3, 5, 7)>.

Moving on to Node 5:
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 8. This forms another 3-star: <5, (0, 4, 8)>.

Moving on to Node 6:
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 9. This forms another 3-star: <6, (1, 2, 9)>.

Moving on to Node 7:
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 8, and 9. This forms another 3-star: <7, (0, 4, 8)>.

Moving on to Node 8:
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 5, 7, and 9. This forms multiple 3-stars:
  - <8, (2, 5, 9)>
  - <8, (4, 5, 7)>
  - <8, (2, 7, 9)>

Moving on to Node 9:
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 6, 7, and 8. This forms multiple 3-stars:
  - <9, (0, 7, 8)>
  - <9, (2, 6, 8)>
  - <9, (3, 7, 8)>

Overall, the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (5, 7, 9)>
<2, (1, 8, 9)>
<4, (3, 5, 7)>
<5, (0, 4, 8)>
<6, (1, 2, 9)>
<7, (0, 4, 8)>
<8, (2, 5, 9)>
<8, (4, 5, 7)>
<8, (2, 7, 9)>
<9, (0, 7, 8)>
<9, (2, 6, 8)>
<9, (3, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
