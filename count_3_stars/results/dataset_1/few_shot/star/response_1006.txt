Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all possible combinations where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes through edges. Let's identify these 3-stars step by step:

1. Node 0 forms 3-stars with the following sets of nodes:
   - <0, (1, 5, 6)>
   - <0, (1, 6, 8)>
   - <0, (5, 6, 8)>

2. Node 1 forms 3-stars with the following sets of nodes:
   - <1, (0, 3, 4)>
   - <1, (0, 4, 8)>
   - <1, (3, 4, 8)>

3. Node 3 forms 3-stars with the following sets of nodes:
   - <3, (1, 2, 4)>
   - <3, (2, 4, 5)>

4. Node 4 forms 3-stars with the following sets of nodes:
   - <4, (1, 2, 8)>
   - <4, (1, 6, 8)>
   - <4, (2, 6, 8)>
   - <4, (2, 3, 6)>

5. Node 5 forms 3-stars with the following sets of nodes:
   - <5, (0, 3, 6)>
   - <5, (0, 3, 8)>
   - <5, (0, 6, 8)>

6. Node 6 forms 3-stars with the following sets of nodes:
   - <6, (0, 4, 5)>
   - <6, (0, 4, 9)>
   - <6, (4, 5, 9)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars:
