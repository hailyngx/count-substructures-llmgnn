Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 4

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the provided graph are as follows:
<2, (3, 6, 7)>
<3, (2, 6, 8)>
<4, (8, 6, 9)>
