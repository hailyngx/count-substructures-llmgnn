Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 3

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern.

There are 5 unique 3-stars in this graph:
<0, (3, 8, 4)>
<1, (3, 5, 7)>
<3, (0, 1, 8)>
<3, (1, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 3, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
