Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Looking at the provided information, we see that the following nodes are connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 4, 7, and 1
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 3
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 4, 7, and 6
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 6, and 8

Therefore, based on the given information, we have 4 unique 3-stars in the graph:
<1, (4, 7, 1)>
<3, (0, 4, 3)>
<6, (4, 7, 6)>
<7, (1, 6, 8)>

Count of 3-stars: [4]
