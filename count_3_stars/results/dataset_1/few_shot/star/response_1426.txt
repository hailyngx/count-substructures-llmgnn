Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 8

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will look for each node that is the center of a 3-star. A 3-star consists of the center node and three leaves connected to the center. Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

1. Node 0: <0, (1, 5, 6)>, <0, (2, 5, 6)>
2. Node 2: <2, (0, 3, 7)>
3. Node 3: <3, (2, 5, 7)>
4. Node 4: <4, (8, 9, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
