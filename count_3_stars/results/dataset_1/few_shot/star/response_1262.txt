Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges, following the definition of a 3-star graph.

Looking at the graph description, we can identify the following 3-stars:

<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<2, (0, 5, 6)>
<4, (0, 1, 9)>
<5, (0, 2, 6)>
<6, (2, 4, 5)>
<7, (2, 8, 9)>
<8, (1, 2, 7)>
<9, (4, 7, 0)>

Therefore, there are [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
