Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (6, 7, 8)>
<1, (3, 4, 9)>
<2, (4, 7, 8)>
<3, (1, 4, 9)>
<4, (2, 3, 8)>
<6, (0, 7, 8)>
<7, (0, 2, 5)>
<8, (4, 6, 9)>
<9, (3, 8, 4)>

Counting these unique 3-stars, we get a total of [ 9 ].
