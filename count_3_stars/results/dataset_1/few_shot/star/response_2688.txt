Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern where one node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Looking at the graph, we see that Node 1, Node 2, and Node 7 each have three neighbors, which means they can potentially act as the center of a 3-star. Let's examine each of these nodes one by one:

1. Node 1:
   - (1, 0, 4, 7)
   - (1, 3, 4, 7)
   
2. Node 2:
   - (2, 5, 7, 9)
   
3. Node 7:
   - (7, 1, 2, 9)

Counting the unique 3-stars, we find that there are <1, (0, 4, 7)>, <1, (3, 4, 7)>, and <2, (5, 7, 9)>, <7, (1, 2, 9)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
