Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the possible 3-stars. A 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes.

From the provided information, we can see that the center node of the 3-star can be any node in the graph. We will iterate over each node and check if it forms a 3-star with its neighbors.

Let's identify the 3-stars present in the graph:

1. Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 3, and 5. <0, (2, 3, 5)>
2. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 4, and 7. <1, (2, 4, 7)>
3. Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, and 3. <2, (0, 1, 3)>
4. Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 2, and 5. <3, (0, 2, 5)>
5. Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 2, and 7. <4, (1, 2, 7)>
6. Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 3, and 9. <5, (0, 3, 9)>
7. Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 5, and 9. <6, (1, 5, 9)>
8. Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 4, and 9. <7, (1, 4, 9)>
9. Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 5, and 7. <9, (1, 5, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9]. 

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (2, 3, 5)>, <1, (2, 4, 7)>, <2, (0, 1, 3)>, <3, (0, 2, 5)>, <4, (1, 2, 7)>, <5, (0, 3, 9)>, <6, (1, 5, 9)>, <7, (1, 4, 9)>, <9, (1, 5, 7)>.
