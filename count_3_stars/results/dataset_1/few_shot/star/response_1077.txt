Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 5
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we find the following 3-stars:
<0, (3, 5, 7)>
<0, (3, 5, 9)>
<0, (5, 7, 9)>
<2, (1, 4, 5)>
<2, (1, 5, 9)>
<2, (4, 5, 9)>
<3, (0, 4, 5)>
<5, (0, 2, 7)>
<9, (0, 2, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
