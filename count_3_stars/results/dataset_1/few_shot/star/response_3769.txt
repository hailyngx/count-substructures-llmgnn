Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 7

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

The 3-stars in the given graph are:
<0, (2, 5, 7)>
<2, (0, 3, 5)>
<4, (6, 7, 9)>
<5, (0, 7, 9)>
<6, (1, 4, 9)>
<7, (5, 8, 9)>
<9, (4, 6, 7)>

Counting these unique 3-stars, we find that there are [7] 3-stars in the graph.
