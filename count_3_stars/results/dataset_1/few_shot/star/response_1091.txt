Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, and node 8

Response:
Okay, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph. 

Given the definition of a 3-star graph, we are looking for instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify each unique 3-star in the graph:

<0, (1, 3, 8)>
<1, (0, 8, 9)>
<2, (4, 5, 6)>
<8, (0, 1, 5)>
<9, (1, 2, 6)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
