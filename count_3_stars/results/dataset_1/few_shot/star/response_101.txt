Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 2

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Since a 3-star graph consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can look for nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them.

Let's list down the 3-stars present in the graph:

<0, (4, 6, 9)>
<2, (1, 8, 9)>
<5, (3, 6, 7)>
<8, (2, 5, 8)>

By listing out the unique 3-stars, we can see that there are a total of [4] 3-stars in the given graph.
