Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the 3-stars, which are central nodes connected to exactly three other nodes.

Looking at the adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (2, 5, 6)>
<4, (2, 6, 7)>
<6, (0, 1, 4)>
<7, (4, 6, 8)>

Therefore, there are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.
