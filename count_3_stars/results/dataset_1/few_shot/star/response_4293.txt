Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all occurrences of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify and count the 3-stars.

The 3-stars in the graph are as follows:
<0, (2, 5, 7)>
<2, (0, 4, 6)>
<4, (2, 6, 8)>
<7, (0, 1, 9)>

Count of 3-stars: [4]
