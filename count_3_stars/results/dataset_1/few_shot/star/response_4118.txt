Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars present.

By definition, a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. We can identify all the 3-stars by checking each node if it has 3 neighbors that are not connected to each other.

Looking at the graph information provided, we can identify the 3-stars as follows:
- Node 3 has three neighbors: Nodes 1, 2, and 5.
- Node 5 has three neighbors: Nodes 2, 4, and 6.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].

List of unique 3-stars found:
<3, (1, 2, 5)>
<5, (2, 4, 6)>
