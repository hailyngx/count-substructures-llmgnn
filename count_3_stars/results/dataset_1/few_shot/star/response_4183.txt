Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, 6, and node 7

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the given graph. From the adjacency list:
- Node 0 has 6 connections.
- Node 1 has 3 connections.
- Node 2 has 3 connections.
- Node 3 has 3 connections.
- Node 4 has 3 connections.
- Node 5 has 3 connections.
- Node 6 has 2 connections.
- Node 7 has 3 connections.
- Node 8 has 1 connection.
- Node 9 has 5 connections.

Node 0, being the only node with 6 connections, can form multiple 3-stars. Let's find all the unique 3-stars in the graph:
- <0, (1, 4, 5)>
- <0, (1, 4, 6)>
- <0, (1, 5, 7)>
- <0, (2, 3, 8)>
- <0, (2, 3, 9)>
- <0, (2, 8, 9)>
- <0, (4, 5, 9)>
- <0, (5, 7, 9)>
- <0, (6, 7, 9)>

Since Node 0 can form 9 unique 3-stars, the final answer is [9].
