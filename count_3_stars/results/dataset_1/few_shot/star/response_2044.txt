Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for each node that has exactly three neighbors and treat that node as the center of a 3-star. 

Upon examining the adjacency list for each node, we observe that only node 0 and node 6 have exactly three neighbors, making them potential centers for 3-stars. Let's list out the unique 3-stars:

<0, (1, 2, 7)>
<0, (1, 7, 9)>
<0, (2, 5, 7)>
<0, (2, 7, 9)>
<6, (7, 8, 9)>
<6, (8, 9, 7)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
