Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a 3-star structure. 
Let's go through the adjacency list of each node and identify the 3-stars:

- From Node 0: <0, (2, 3, 5)>
- From Node 1: <1, (2, 4, 5)>
- From Node 2: No 3-stars can be formed as it is connected to only 2 other nodes.
- From Node 3: <3, (0, 4, 5)>
- From Node 4: No 3-stars can be formed as it is connected to only 2 other nodes.
- From Node 5: No new 3-stars can be formed as (0, 2, 3, 4) have already been counted.
- From Node 6: No 3-stars can be formed as it is connected to only 2 other nodes.
- From Node 7: No 3-stars can be formed as it is connected to only 2 other nodes.
- From Node 8: No new 3-stars can be formed as (1, 5) have already been counted.
- From Node 9: No 3-stars can be formed as it is connected to only 2 other nodes.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (2, 3, 5)>
<1, (2, 4, 5)>
