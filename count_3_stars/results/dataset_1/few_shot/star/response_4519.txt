Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 7

Response:
Let's identify all the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (2, 5, 9)>
<1, (2, 7, 8)>
<2, (0, 1, 9)>
<4, (6, 7, 0)>
<5, (0, 6, 1)>
<6, (4, 5, 7)>
<7, (1, 2, 4)>
<8, (1, 6, 0)>
<9, (0, 2, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
