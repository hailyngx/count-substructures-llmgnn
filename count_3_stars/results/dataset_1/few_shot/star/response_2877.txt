Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 4, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star in the graph and then count them.

Let's find the 3-stars in the graph:

- For each node, check if it is the center of a 3-star by looking at its neighbors. If a node has exactly three neighbors, it is a center of a 3-star.
- For each node that is a center of a 3-star, list the three nodes connected to it as leaves.

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<1, (4, 6, 8)>
<2, (0, 7, 8)>
<3, (0, 4, 9)>
<4, (0, 1, 8)>
<5, (6, 7, 9)>
<6, (1, 5, 7)>
<7, (2, 5, 6)>
<8, (2, 4, 9)>
<9, (3, 4, 7)>

There are [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
