Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 44 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 7, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. This indicates the presence of a 3-star structure centered at that node.

Looking at the adjacency list, we can see that the nodes which are connected to exactly three other nodes are: nodes 0, 1, 3, 5, and 7. Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<0, (1, 3, 7)>
<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<1, (0, 3, 6)>
<1, (0, 3, 7)>
<1, (0, 7, 9)>
<3, (0, 5, 6)>
<3, (1, 7, 9)>
<3, (2, 5, 7)>
<3, (5, 7, 8)>
<3, (7, 8, 9)>
<5, (0, 3, 7)>
<5, (0, 7, 8)>
<5, (3, 7, 8)>
<7, (0, 1, 9)>
<7, (0, 3, 9)>
<7, (1, 8, 9)>
<7, (3, 8, 9)>
<7, (4, 5, 8)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [19].
