Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible 3-stars. 

From the definition of a 3-star, we know that each 3-star includes a center node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (4, 5, 8)>
<1, (2, 3, X)>
<2, (1, 3, 6)>
<3, (1, 2, 4)>
<4, (0, 3, 7)>
<5, (0, 7, 8)>
<6, (2, 7, 8)>
<7, (2, 4, 5)>
<8, (0, 5, 6)>

Count of 3-stars in the given graph: [9]
