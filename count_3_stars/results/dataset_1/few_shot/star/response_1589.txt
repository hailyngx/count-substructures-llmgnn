Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 8

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (2, 5, 6)>
<0, (3, 6, 7)>
<0, (5, 6, 9)>
<6, (0, 3, 4)>
<6, (0, 4, 7)>
<6, (0, 7, 9)>
<2, (0, 4, 5)>
<8, (1, 9, 0)>
