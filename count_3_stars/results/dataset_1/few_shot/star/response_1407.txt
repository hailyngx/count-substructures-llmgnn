Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that has exactly 3 neighbors connected to it, forming a 3-star pattern.

1. For Node 2, it is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 4, forming a 3-star. <2, (0, 3, 4)>

2. For Node 7, it is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 9, forming a 3-star. <7, (2, 5, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
