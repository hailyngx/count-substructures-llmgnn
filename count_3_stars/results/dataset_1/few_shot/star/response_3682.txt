Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's find all the 3-stars:

<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<3, (4, 7, 9)>
<4, (0, 3, 9)>
<5, (0, 2, 7)>
<7, (3, 4, 5)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
