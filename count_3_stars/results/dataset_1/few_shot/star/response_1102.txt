Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 2

Response:
The 3-stars in this graph are:
<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<1, (0, 6, 8)>
<2, (3, 8, 9)>
<3, (2)>
<4, (0, 5, 7)>
<5, (0, 4, 8)>
<6, (1, 7, 8)>
<7, (0, 4, 6)>
<8, (1, 2, 5)>
<9, (2)>

So, there are [10] 3-stars in this graph.
