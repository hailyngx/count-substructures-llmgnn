Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 6

Node 6 is connected to node 2, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through each node and its connections to find all the 3-stars:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 5, and 8. Node 0 forms 3-stars with nodes 2, 5, 8. So, we have <0, (2, 5, 8)>.
  
- Node 1 is connected to node 9. Node 1 doesn't form a 3-star.

- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 6. Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 4, 6. So, we have <2, (0, 4, 6)>.
  
- Node 3 is connected to node 0. Node 3 doesn't form a 3-star.
  
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 9. Node 4 doesn't form a 3-star.
  
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 7. Node 5 doesn't form a 3-star.
  
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 7, 8, 9. Node 6 forms 3-stars with nodes 2, 7, 8 and 2, 6, 9. So, we have <6, (2, 7, 8)> and <6, (2, 6, 9)>.
  
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 5, 6. Node 7 doesn't form a 3-star.
  
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 6. Node 8 doesn't form a 3-star.
  
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 6. Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 4, 9. So, we have <9, (1, 4, 6)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
