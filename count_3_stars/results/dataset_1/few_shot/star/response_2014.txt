Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all occurrences of the 3-star pattern. 

A 3-star pattern consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Given the adjacency list and edges, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 2: (2, 4, 5)
2. Node 4: (4, 0, 6)
3. Node 5: (5, 1, 7)
4. Node 6: (6, 1, 4)
5. Node 7: (7, 2, 5)
6. Node 8: (8, 2, 3)

Count of 3-stars: [6]
Unique 3-stars:
<2, (4, 5, 2)>
<4, (0, 6, 4)>
<5, (1, 7, 5)>
<6, (1, 4, 6)>
<7, (2, 5, 7)>
<8, (2, 3, 8)>
