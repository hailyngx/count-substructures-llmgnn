Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 3

Response:
First, we can identify all the 3-stars in the given graph. 

The adjacency list shows that the nodes connected to each node are as follows:
- Node 0: 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 1: 4, 8
- Node 2: 6
- Node 3: 5, 9
- Node 4: 0, 1, 5
- Node 5: 3, 4, 8
- Node 6: 0, 2
- Node 7: None
- Node 8: 0, 1, 5
- Node 9: 0, 3

Now, we will list all the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (4, 6, 8)>
<0, (4, 8, 5)>
<0, (4, 1, 5)>
<0, (6, 4, 5)>
<0, (8, 1, 5)>
<0, (8, 5, 3)>
<0, (9, 0, 4)>
<0, (9, 0, 6)>
<0, (9, 0, 8)>
<1, (4, 8, 5)>
<3, (5, 8, 0)>
<4, (0, 1, 5)>
<4, (0, 5, 3)>
<4, (1, 0, 5)>
<4, (1, 5, 3)>
<5, (3, 4, 0)>
<5, (3, 8, 0)>
<8, (0, 1, 5)>
<9, (0, 3, 5)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [19].
