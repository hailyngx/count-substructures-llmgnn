Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (4, 1) (4, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 7
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all possible 3-stars. 

The possible 3-stars in the given graph are:
<0, (1, 2, 0)>
<1, (0, 2, 1)>
<1, (0, 4, 1)>
<1, (0, 6, 1)>
<1, (0, 8, 1)>
<1, (0, 9, 1)>
<1, (2, 0, 1)>
<1, (2, 1, 0)>
<1, (2, 7, 1)>
<1, (4, 1, 9)>
<1, (6, 1, 7)>
<1, (8, 1, 0)>
<1, (9, 4, 1)>
<1, (9, 7, 1)>
<2, (0, 1, 2)>
<2, (1, 0, 2)>
<2, (1, 7, 2)>
<4, (1, 9, 4)>
<6, (1, 7, 6)>
<7, (2, 6, 7)>
<9, (1, 4, 9)>
<9, (1, 7, 9)>

Now, we count the number of unique 3-stars:
