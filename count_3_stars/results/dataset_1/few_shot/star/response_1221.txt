Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, and node 7

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- Node 0 forms a 3-star with leaves 3, 7, and 9. <0, (3, 7, 9)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with leaves 2, 6, and 9. <4, (2, 6, 9)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with leaves 4, 5, and 9. <6, (4, 5, 9)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with leaves 1, 2, and 4. <9, (1, 2, 4)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with leaves 0, 7, and 6. <9, (0, 7, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
