Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify the 3-stars by locating central nodes and their connected leaves. Let's go step-by-step: 

1. Identify the central nodes:
- Node 0, Node 2, Node 3, Node 6, Node 7, and Node 8 have degree 3, making them potential central nodes.

2. Check the connections for each potential central node to find the 3-stars:
- For Node 0:
  - <0, (2, 6, 8)>
- For Node 2:
  - <2, (0, 3, 7)>
- For Node 3:
  - <3, (2, 5, 6)>
  - <3, (2, 6, 7)>
  - <3, (2, 7, 8)>
  - <3, (5, 6, 7)>
  - <3, (6, 7, 8)>
- For Node 6:
  - <6, (0, 3, 8)>
- For Node 7:
  - <7, (2, 3, 8)>
- For Node 8:
  - <8, (0, 3, 6)>
  - <8, (3, 4, 7)>
  - <8, (4, 6, 7)>
  
Count of 3-stars: [11]
Unique 3-stars: <0, (2, 6, 8)>, <2, (0, 3, 7)>, <3, (2, 5, 6)>, <3, (2, 6, 7)>, <3, (2, 7, 8)>, <3, (5, 6, 7)>, <3, (6, 7, 8)>, <6, (0, 3, 8)>, <7, (2, 3, 8)>, <8, (0, 3, 6)>, <8, (3, 4, 7)>
