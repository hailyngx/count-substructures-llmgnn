Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 4

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph step by step:

1. Determine the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
   - Node 0 (connected to nodes 2, 7, and 9)
   - Node 2 (connected to nodes 0, 4, and 9)
   - Node 4 (connected to nodes 2, 6, and 9)
   - Node 6 (connected to nodes 1, 2, and 4)
   
2. Identify the 3-stars formed by the nodes found above:
   - <0, (2, 7, 9)>
   - <2, (0, 4, 9)>
   - <4, (2, 6, 9)>
   - <6, (1, 2, 4)>

So, there are a total of [4] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
