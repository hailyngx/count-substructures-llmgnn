Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star. 

Let's go through the nodes one by one:

Node 0:
- Forms 3-stars with (1, 2, 4), (2, 3, 4) 

Node 1:
- No 3-stars

Node 2:
- No 3-stars

Node 3:
- No 3-stars

Node 4:
- Forms 3-stars with (0, 1, 2), (0, 2, 5), (0, 3, 5), (0, 5, 7), (2, 5, 8)

Node 5:
- No 3-stars

Node 6:
- No 3-stars

Node 7:
- No 3-stars

Node 8:
- No 3-stars

Node 9:
- No 3-stars

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<4, (0, 1, 2)>
<0, (2, 5, 7)>
<2, (5, 8)>
