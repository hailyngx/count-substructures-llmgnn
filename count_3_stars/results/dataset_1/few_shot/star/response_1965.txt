Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify sets of four nodes where one node is connected to the other three nodes, forming a 3-star pattern.

Upon analyzing the given graph, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<1, (7, 8, 9)>
<6, (2, 7, 8)>
<8, (1, 6, 9)>

Thus, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
