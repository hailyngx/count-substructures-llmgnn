Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<1, (3, 4, 5)>
<1, (3, 5, 6)>
<3, (1, 4, 5)>
<3, (1, 5, 7)>
<3, (5, 6, 9)>
<5, (1, 2, 3)>
<5, (1, 3, 6)>
<5, (3, 6, 9)>
<6, (1, 5, 9)>
<9, (3, 5, 6)>

Therefore, there are a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph. 
Here is the list of unique 3-stars: 
<1, (3, 4, 5)>
<1, (3, 5, 6)>
<3, (1, 4, 5)>
<3, (1, 5, 7)>
<3, (5, 6, 9)>
<5, (1, 2, 3)>
<5, (1, 3, 6)>
<5, (3, 6, 9)>
<6, (1, 5, 9)>
<9, (3, 5, 6)>
