Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's analyze the connections for each node:
- Node 0 is not connected to exactly three other nodes.
- Node 1 is not connected to exactly three other nodes.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 6, forming a 3-star <2, (0, 4, 6)>.
- Node 3 is not connected to exactly three other nodes.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 7, forming a 3-star <4, (2, 5, 7)>.
- Node 5 is not connected to exactly three other nodes.
- Node 6 is not connected to exactly three other nodes.
- Node 7 is not connected to exactly three other nodes.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 6, forming a 3-star <8, (2, 5, 6)>.
- Node 9 is not connected to exactly three other nodes.

Therefore, there are 3 unique 3-stars in the given graph: <2, (0, 4, 6)>, <4, (2, 5, 7)>, <8, (2, 5, 6)>.
The total number of 3-stars in this graph is [3].
