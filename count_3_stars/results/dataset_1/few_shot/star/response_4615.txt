Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern.

Based on the provided information, the 3-stars in the graph are:
<0, (5, 6, 7)>
<0, (5, 7, 9)>
<1, (2, 3, 8)>
<3, (1, 5, 8)>
<6, (0, 4, 7)>
<8, (1, 4, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
