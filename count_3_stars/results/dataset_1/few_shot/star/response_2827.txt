Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star-like formation.

Let's list the 3-stars we find:

<1, (6, 7, 9)>
<2, (3, 5, 8)>
<3, (2, 6, 8)>
<4, (5, 7, 8)>
<5, (2, 4, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
