Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 8

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node forms exactly three edges with other nodes. Let's start by listing the 3-star configurations:

<0, (3, 8, 9)>
<1, (6, 8, _)>
<2, (5, 7, 9)>
<3, (0, 6, _)>
<4, (7, _, _)>
<5, (_, 2, _)>
<6, (1, 3, 7)>
<7, (2, 4, 6)>
<8, (0, 1, 9)>
<9, (0, 2, 8)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we can see that there are [9] 3-stars in total.
