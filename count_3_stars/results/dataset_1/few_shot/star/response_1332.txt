Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 5

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 7, and 9. 3-star: <0, (3, 7, 9)>
2. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 6, and 7. 3-star: <1, (3, 6, 7)>
3. Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, and 7. 3-star: <3, (0, 1, 7)>
4. Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 4, and 6. 3-star: <5, (2, 4, 6)>
5. Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 6, and 8. 3-star: <5, (4, 6, 8)>
6. Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 8, and 9. 3-star: <5, (6, 8, 9)>

Count of 3-stars: [6]
