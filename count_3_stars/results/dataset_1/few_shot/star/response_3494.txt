Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique configurations where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Let's analyze the graph based on the provided information and identify all the 3-stars:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 7.
   Possible 3-star: <0, (5, 6, 7)>

2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, and 7.
   No 3-star involving Node 1 as the center as it is connected to four nodes.

3. Node 2 is connected to node 1.
   No 3-star involving Node 2 as the center as it is connected to only one node.

4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 1 and 4.
   No 3-star involving Node 3 as the center as it is connected to only two nodes.

5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 8, and 9.
   No 3-star involving Node 4 as the center as it is connected to four nodes.

6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0 and 6.
   No 3-star involving Node 5 as the center as it is connected to only two nodes.

7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 5, 8, and 9.
   Possible 3-star: <6, (0, 5, 8)>, <6, (0, 5, 9)>

8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 8, and 9.
   No 3-star involving Node 7 as the center as it is connected to four nodes.

9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 7.
   No 3-star involving Node 8 as the center as it is connected to three nodes.

10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 7.
   No 3-star involving Node 9 as the center as it is connected to three nodes.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2]. 
The unique 3-stars found are <0, (5, 6, 7)> and <6, (0, 5, 8)>.
