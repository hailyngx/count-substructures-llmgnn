Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

From the given adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<0, (4, 6, 9)>
<0, (5, 6, 9)>
<2, (5, 6, 8)>
<3, (6, 9, 0)>
<4, (0, 9, 6)>
<5, (0, 2, 6)>
<6, (0, 2, 3)>
<6, (0, 2, 5)>
<6, (0, 7, 5)>
<6, (2, 5, 7)>
<6, (2, 7, 8)>
<6, (3, 9, 0)>
<6, (5, 7, 0)>
<6, (5, 7, 2)>
<6, (7, 2, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [16].
