Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, 8, and node 9
