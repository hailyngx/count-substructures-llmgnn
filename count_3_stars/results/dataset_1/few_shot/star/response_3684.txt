Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we can identify each 3-star pattern in the graph:

1. Node 0: No 3-star as it only has 2 edges.
2. Node 1: No 3-star as it only has 3 edges.
3. Node 2: No 3-star as it only has 3 edges.
4. Node 3: No 3-star as it only has 1 edge.
5. Node 4: <4, (0, 3, 5)>
6. Node 5: No 3-star as it has 4 edges but they are already considered in node 4.
7. Node 6: No 3-star as it only has 2 edges.
8. Node 7: No 3-star as it only has 1 edge.
9. Node 8: No 3-star as it only has 3 edges.
10. Node 9: No 3-star as it only has 4 edges.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1] and it is represented by <4, (0, 3, 5)>.
