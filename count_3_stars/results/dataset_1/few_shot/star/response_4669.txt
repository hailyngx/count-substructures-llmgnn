Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the provided graph with 10 nodes and 36 edges, we first need to understand the definition of a 3-star graph and then identify each 3-star in the graph. 

A 3-star graph consists of a central node (the center) connected to exactly three other nodes (leaves) by edges. 

Let's list each unique 3-star found in the graph: 

<0, (3, 6, 7)>
<0, (3, 6, 9)>
<0, (3, 7, 9)>
<2, (1, 7, 8)>
<3, (0, 1, 7)>
<3, (0, 7, 9)>
<4, (2, 6, 8)>
<6, (0, 4, 8)>
<6, (0, 8, 9)>
<8, (1, 3, 4)>
<8, (1, 3, 6)>
<8, (1, 4, 6)>
<8, (2, 4, 6)>
<9, (0, 3, 6)>

Count the total number of 3-stars in the graph:
