Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 3

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- In the adjacency list, we see that Node 0 is connected to nodes 5 and 8. So, the 3-star centered at Node 0 is <0, (5, 8)>
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. This results in the following 3-stars: <1, (2, 4, 5)>, <1, (2, 7, 8)>, <1, (4, 7, 8)>, and <1, (5, 6, 7)>
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 7, and 9. The 3-star centered at Node 2 is <2, (1, 7, 9)>
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 5, 7, and 9. The 3-star centered at Node 3 is <3, (5, 7, 9)>
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1 and 8. So, the 3-star centered at Node 4 is <4, (1, 8, 9)>
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 3. This results in the following 3-stars: <5, (0, 3, 8)>, <5, (0, 1, 4)>, and <5, (1, 3, 7)>
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, and 8. This results in the following 3-stars: <7, (1, 3, 9)>, <7, (1, 2, 9)>, and <7, (2, 3, 9)>
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, and 7. The 3-star centered at Node 8 is <8, (0, 4, 7)>
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2 and 3. So, the 3-star centered at Node 9 is <9, (2, 3, 7)>

Now we count the total number of unique 3-stars: 9
So, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
The unique 3-stars are: <0, (5, 8)>, <1, (2, 4, 5)>, <1, (2, 7, 8)>, <1, (4, 7, 8)>, <1, (5, 6, 7)>, <2, (1, 7, 9)>, <3, (5, 7, 9)>, <4, (1, 8, 9)>, <5, (0, 3, 8)>, <5, (0, 1, 4)>, <5, (1, 3, 7)>, <7, (1, 3, 9)>, <7, (1, 2, 9)>, <7, (2, 3, 9)>, <8, (0, 4, 7)>, <9, (2, 3, 7)>
