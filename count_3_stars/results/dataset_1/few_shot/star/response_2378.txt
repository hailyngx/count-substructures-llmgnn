Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
There is only one unique 3-star in this graph, which is:
<0, (1, 3, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1].
