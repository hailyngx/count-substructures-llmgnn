Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, 6, and node 8

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph by looking for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the adjacency list, the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes are:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 5.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 7, and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 8.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1 and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 8.

Now let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:
There are 3 3-stars centered at Node 0: <0, (1, 2, 5)>, <0, (1, 5, 9)>, <0, (2, 5, 9)>
There are 2 3-stars centered at Node 2: <2, (0, 7, 9)>, <2, (1, 7, 8)>
There are 3 3-stars centered at Node 4: <4, (1, 5, 8)>, <4, (0, 5, 9)>, <4, (7, 8, 9)>
There are 1 3-star centered at Node 6: <6, (1, 9, 0)>
There are 3 3-stars centered at Node 7: <7, (1, 2, 8)>, <7, (0, 1, 5)>, <7, (0, 1, 6)>

So, there are a total of [12] 3-stars in the given graph.
