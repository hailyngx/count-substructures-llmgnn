Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify all unique 3-stars. 

Let's first identify the nodes that can be the center of a 3-star. These are the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. From the adjacency list, we can see that nodes 0, 2, 6, and 8 meet this criterion. 

Now, let's identify the 3-stars associated with each of these potential centers:

- For node 0:
    - <0, (4, 5, 8)>
    - <0, (4, 5, 9)>

- For node 2:
    - <2, (5, 6, 7)>

- For node 6:
    - <6, (1, 4, 5)>
    - <6, (1, 2, 5)>
    - <6, (2, 4, 5)>

- For node 8:
    - <8, (0, 9, 4)>
    - <8, (0, 9, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
