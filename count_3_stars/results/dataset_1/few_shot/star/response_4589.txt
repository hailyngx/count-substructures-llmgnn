Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 2, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 9
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's find the 3-stars in this graph step by step:

1. Starting with Node 0:
   - Node 0 is connected to Node 1, 5, and 8. This forms a 3-star with Node 0 as the center and nodes 1, 5, and 8 as the leaves. <0, (1, 5, 8)>

2. Moving on to Node 1:
   - Node 1 is connected to Node 0, 5, and 9. This forms a 3-star with Node 1 as the center and nodes 0, 5, and 9 as the leaves. <1, (0, 5, 9)>

3. Next, Node 2:
   - Node 2 is connected to Node 3, 5, 8, and 9. However, this does not form any 3-star as Node 2 is connected to four other nodes.

4. Considering Node 3:
   - Node 3 is connected to Node 2 and 4. This does not form a 3-star as Node 3 is connected to only two other nodes.

5. Analyzing Node 4:
   - Node 4 is connected to Node 3, 6, 8, and 9. Again, this does not form a 3-star as Node 4 is connected to four other nodes.

6. Node 5:
   - Node 5 is connected to Node 0, 1, 2, and 9. This does not form a 3-star as Node 5 is connected to four other nodes.

7. Node 6:
   - Node 6 is connected to Node 4, 8, and 9. This forms a 3-star with Node 6 as the center and nodes 4, 8, and 9 as the leaves. <6, (4, 8, 9)>

8. Node 7:
   - Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes, so it does not form a 3-star.

9. Node 8:
   - Node 8 is connected to Node 0, 2, 4, 6, and 9. This forms a 3-star with Node 8 as the center and nodes 0, 4, and 6 as the leaves. <8, (0, 4, 6)>

10. Finally, Node 9:
    - Node 9 is connected to Node 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 8. This does not form a 3-star as Node 9 is connected to six other nodes.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
