Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible 3-stars based on the definition provided.

Let's first list all the 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (1, 8, 9)>
<1, (0, 3, 6)>
<4, (5, 7, 9)>
<8, (0, 4, 9)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars: [4].
