Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a star pattern.

Let's find the 3-star patterns in the graph:

1. Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 3, and 4: <0, (2, 3, 4)>
2. Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 7, and 8: <0, (6, 7, 8)>
3. Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 4, and 8: <2, (3, 4, 8)>
4. Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 0, and 2: <3, (5, 0, 2)>
5. Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 0, and 2: <4, (9, 0, 2)>
6. Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 9, and 3: <5, (1, 9, 3)>

These are all the unique 3-star patterns in the graph. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
