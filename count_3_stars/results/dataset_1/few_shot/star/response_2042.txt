Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 4, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 5

Response:
Based on the given graph, we can identify the 3-stars by looking for nodes that are each connected to exactly three other nodes. Here are the 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<1, (6, 7, 8)>
<2, (0, 3, 5)>
<3, (2, 4, 7)>
<4, (0, 6, 9)>
<5, (0, 6, 9)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we find a total of [6] 3-stars in the graph.
