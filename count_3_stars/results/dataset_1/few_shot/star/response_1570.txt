Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the given graph and adjacency list, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<1, (3, 4, 7)>
<3, (1, 7, 8)>
<4, (1, 5, 8)>
<5, (0, 4, 6)>
<7, (0, 1, 3)>
<8, (3, 4)>
<9, (3, 6)>

Thus, there are a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
