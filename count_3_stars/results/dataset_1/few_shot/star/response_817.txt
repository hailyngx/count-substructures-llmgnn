Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 5

Response:
There are a total of [3] 3-star configurations in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<3, (1, 2, 5)>
<5, (0, 3, 4)>
