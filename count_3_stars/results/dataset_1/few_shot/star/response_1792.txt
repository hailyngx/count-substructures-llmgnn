Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 5, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-star subgraphs in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Looking at the adjacency list for each node, we can identify the 3-star subgraphs as follows:

<1, (2, 4, 5)>
<2, (1, 3, 6)>
<5, (1, 3, 8)>
<8, (2, 5, 9)>

Therefore, there are a total of [4] 3-star subgraphs in the given graph.
