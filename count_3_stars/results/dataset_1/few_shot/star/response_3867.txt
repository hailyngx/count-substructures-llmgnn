Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 5) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5

Response:
Initially, we can identify that nodes 5, 6, and 8 are the center nodes of potential 3-stars since each of them has exactly three edges connecting them to other nodes. Let's examine each potential 3-star centered at nodes 5, 6, and 8:

For the center node 5:
- <5, (1, 3, 7)>
- <5, (1, 3, 9)>
- <5, (1, 7, 9)>
- <5, (3, 7, 9)>

For the center node 6:
- <6, (0, 4, 8)>
- <6, (0, 8, 3)>
- <6, (4, 8, 3)>

For the center node 8:
- <8, (3, 6, 5)>
- <8, (3, 6, 9)>
- <8, (3, 5, 9)>

Therefore, there are 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph:
