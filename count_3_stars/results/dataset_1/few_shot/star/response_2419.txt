Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, 7, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 8

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify the central node and its three connected nodes for each 3-star. 

Looking at the adjacency list, we can determine the following 3-stars:
<0, (1, 2, 7)>
<2, (0, 5, 8)>
<5, (2, 3, 7)>
<8, (1, 2, 4)>
<8, (2, 6, 9)>
<9, (2, 5, 8)>

Therefore, there are a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
