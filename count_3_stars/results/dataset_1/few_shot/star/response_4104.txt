Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 6
Node 4 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the possible configurations of 3-stars. 

Let's first identify all the nodes with exactly three neighbors (leaves) since the center of a 3-star graph is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Nodes such as 4 and 9 do not have three neighbors, so they cannot be the center of a 3-star.

Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, and 7 have three neighbors each, making them potential centers of 3-stars. Let's analyze each of these nodes by considering the neighbors:

1. Node 0: (1, 3, 5), (1, 3, 6), (1, 5, 6), (3, 5, 6)
2. Node 1: (0, 2, 3), (0, 2, 5), (0, 3, 5)
3. Node 2: (1, 7, 9)
4. Node 3: (0, 1, 6)
5. Node 6: (0, 3, 8), (0, 7, 8)
6. Node 7: (0, 2, 8)

Let's count the number of unique 3-stars and then put the final count inside brackets:

[7]

Unique 3-stars: 
<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<0, (1, 3, 6)>
<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<2, (1, 7, 9)>
<7, (0, 2, 8)>
