Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 44 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 3, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the 3-stars present. 

Let's go through each node and check if it is the center of a 3-star.
Let's list out the 3-stars we find:

<0, (2, 7, 8)>
<2, (0, 4, 8)>
<4, (1, 2, 8)>
<5, (2, 6, 8)>
<7, (0, 5, 8)>
<8, (0, 2, 4)>
<9, (0, 5, 7)>

There are 7 unique 3-stars in total.

Therefore, the final answer is [7].
