Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 6, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, 7, and node 8

Response:
By analyzing the given graph, we can find the 3-stars by identifying nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through the nodes and identify the 3-stars:

1. Node 0: <0, (1, 2, 4)>
2. Node 1: <1, (0, 6, 7)>
3. Node 2: <2, (0, 3, 4)>
4. Node 3: <3, (2, 6, 7)>
5. Node 4: <4, (0, 7, 9)>
6. Node 5: No 3-stars
7. Node 6: No 3-stars
8. Node 7: <7, (1, 4, 9)>
9. Node 8: <8, (1, 3, 9)>
10. Node 9: No 3-stars

Count of 3-stars: [6]
