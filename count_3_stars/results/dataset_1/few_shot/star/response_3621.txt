Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 8

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are as follows:

<1, (4, 6, 7)>
<2, (6, 4, 7)>
<4, (1, 6, 7)>
<6, (2, 4, 7)>
<7, (1, 4, 2)>
<9, (0, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
