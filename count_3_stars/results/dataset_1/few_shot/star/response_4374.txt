Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 10 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (5, 3) (7, 0) (7, 9) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 3
Node 2 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 3
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 7

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are:
[<0, (4, 7, 9)>]
