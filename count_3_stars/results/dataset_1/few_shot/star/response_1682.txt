Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node and the three connected nodes for each 3-star. 

Let's go through each node and identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0: (0, 7, 8, 9) [0]
- Node 1: (1, 2, 3, 5) [1, (2, 5, 9, 6)]
- Node 2: (2, 1, 5, 6) [2, (1, 5, 9, 6)]
- Node 3: (3, 1, 8) [3]
- Node 4: (4, 5, 6) [4]
- Node 5: (5, 1, 2, 4, 9) [(5, 2, 9, 6)]
- Node 6: (6, 2, 4, 9) [(5, 2, 9, 6)]
- Node 7: (7, 0) [7]
- Node 8: (8, 0, 3, 9) [8]
- Node 9: (9, 0, 5, 6, 8) [9]

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (7, 8, 9)>, <1, (2, 5, 9, 6)>, <2, (1, 5, 9, 6)>, <3>, <4>, <5, (2, 9, 6)>, <7>, <8>, <9>.
