Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 0) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 0
Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 8 is connected to node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 8

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are:
<[0, (2, 4, 6)], [4, (0, 2, 5)], [9, (1, 8, 9)]> 
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
