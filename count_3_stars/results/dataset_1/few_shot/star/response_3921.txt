Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 0, and node 3

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star structures in the given graph. 
Since a 3-star consists of a central node connected to three other nodes, we can find all 3-stars by looking for nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them. 

The nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them are:
- Node 2: Connected to nodes 5, 6, and 7
- Node 5: Connected to nodes 2, 3, and 7
- Node 6: Connected to nodes 2, 3, and 7
- Node 7: Connected to nodes 2, 5, and 6

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars by considering each of these nodes as the central node:
1. If we consider Node 2 as the central node:
    - <2, (5, 6, 7)>
    
2. If we consider Node 5 as the central node:
    - <5, (2, 3, 7)>

3. If we consider Node 6 as the central node:
    - <6, (2, 3, 7)>

4. If we consider Node 7 as the central node:
    - <7, (2, 5, 6)>

Therefore, there are a total of [4] 3-stars in the given graph.
