Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 8, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 3, 4, 5, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique configurations where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Based on the given information, here are the 3-stars present in the graph:
<0, (2, 7, 9)>
<1, (3, 5, 6)>
<2, (0, 3, 5)>
<3, (1, 2, 9)>
<5, (1, 2, 8)>
<6, (1, 7, 8)>
<7, (0, 2, 6)>
<8, (1, 2, 5)>
<9, (0, 3, 4)>
<9, (5, 8, 8)>

Count of 3-stars: [10]
