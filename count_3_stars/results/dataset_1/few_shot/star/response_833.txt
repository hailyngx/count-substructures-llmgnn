Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars present in the graph. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's analyze the graph step by step to find the 3-stars.

1. Node 0:
    - Node 0 is not part of any 3-star since it is not connected to three other nodes.

2. Node 1:
    - Node 1 is connected to nodes 4 and 7. However, it is not part of any 3-star since it does not have exactly three connections.

3. Node 2:
    - Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, and 9. 
    - There is one 3-star centered at node 2: <2, (0, 4, 9)>

4. Node 3:
    - Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 8, and 9.
    - There are two 3-stars centered at node 3: <3, (2, 8, 9)> and <3, (2, 5, 9)>

5. Node 4:
    - Node 4 is connected to nodes 1 and 2.
    - There are no 3-stars centered at node 4.

6. Node 5:
    - Node 5 is connected to nodes 3, 7, 8, and 9.
    - There is one 3-star centered at node 5: <5, (3, 7, 8)>

7. Node 6:
    - Node 6 is not part of any 3-star since it is not connected to three other nodes.

8. Node 7:
    - Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 6, and 8.
    - There is one 3-star centered at node 7: <7, (1, 5, 8)>

9. Node 8:
    - Node 8 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 7, and 9.
    - There is one 3-star centered at node 8: <8, (3, 5, 9)>

10. Node 9:
    - Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 5, and 8.
    - There is one 3-star centered at node 9: <9, (2, 5, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6]. The unique 3-stars found in the graph are <2, (0, 4, 9)>, <3, (2, 8, 9)>, <3, (2, 5, 9)>, <5, (3, 7, 8)>, <7, (1, 5, 8)>, and <8, (3, 5, 9)>.
