Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Looking at the adjacency list of each node, we can identify the 3-stars using the definition provided.

Let's list down the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<2, (0, 6, 8)>
<3, (0, 4, 7)>
<5, (0, 1, 6)>
<7, (0, 1, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
