Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 7

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to find all the 3-stars. 

A 3-star consists of a central node and three leaf nodes connected to the central node. Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. For node 0: (0, 3, 6, 7) - <0, (3, 6, 7)>
2. For node 3: (3, 0, 6, 9) - <3, (0, 6, 9)>
3. For node 6: (6, 0, 3, 5) - <6, (0, 3, 5)>
4. For node 7: (7, 0, 8, 9) - <7, (0, 8, 9)>

There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
