Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a star pattern. Let's identify and count the 3-stars in this graph:

1. Node 1: (3, 5, 9): <1, (3, 5, 9)>
2. Node 3: (1, 5, 7): <3, (1, 5, 7)>
3. Node 9: (1, 6, 8): <9, (1, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
