Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 1 is connected to node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 5

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three others (forming a 3-star) and then count them. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars: 
<2, (5, 6, 9)>
<3, (6, 8, 4)>
<4, (8, 9, 5)>
<5, (2, 6, 9)>
<6, (2, 3, 7)>
<8, (3, 4, 9)>
<9, (4, 5, 8)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
