Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 4

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are as follows:
[5]

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [1].
