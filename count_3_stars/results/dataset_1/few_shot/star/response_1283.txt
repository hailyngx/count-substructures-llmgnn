Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 8
Node 3 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 4 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 4, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, which is the definition of a 3-star. Then we need to count the number of unique 3-stars present in the graph.

Given the adjacency list of each node, we can start identifying the 3-stars. 
Let's list out the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<1, (2, 5, 9)>
<2, (1, 5, 8)>
<4, (7, 8, 9)>
<5, (2, 8, 9)>
<6, (8, 9, 0)>
<7, (0, 4, 8)>
<9, (1, 8, 4)> 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
