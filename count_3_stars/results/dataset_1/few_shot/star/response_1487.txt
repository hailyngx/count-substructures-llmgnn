Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 5, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 7

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify nodes that have exactly three neighbors. These nodes will be the centers of potential 3-stars. Let's go through the adjacency list and identify such nodes:

- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1 and 2. Node 6 has exactly two neighbors.
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 5. Node 0 has exactly three neighbors, so it is the center of a 3-star.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 7. Node 9 has exactly three neighbors, so it is the center of a 3-star.

Therefore, there are two 3-stars in the given graph.
