Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 7
Node 9 is not connected to any other nodes.

Response:
Starting with the center node 0, we can identify the 3-stars connected to it:
- Center: 0, Leaves: (2, 7)
- Center: 0, Leaves: (7, 5)
Thus, there are two 3-stars connected to node 0.

Moving on to center node 1:
- Center: 1, Leaves: (2, 3, 5)
There is one 3-star connected to node 1.

For center node 2:
- Center: 2, Leaves: (0, 1, 3)
- Center: 2, Leaves: (2, 8, 3)
There are two 3-stars connected to node 2.

For center node 3:
- Center: 3, Leaves: (1, 2, 8)
- Center: 3, Leaves: (6, 4)
There are two 3-stars connected to node 3.

For center node 7:
- Center: 7, Leaves: (0, 8, 5)
There is one 3-star connected to node 7.

Now, counting all the unique 3-stars found, we have:
<[0, (2, 7)], [0, (7, 5)], [1, (2, 3, 5)], [2, (0, 1, 3)], [2, (2, 8, 3)], [3, (1, 2, 8)], [3, (6, 4)], [7, (0, 8, 5)]>
Therefore, there are [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
