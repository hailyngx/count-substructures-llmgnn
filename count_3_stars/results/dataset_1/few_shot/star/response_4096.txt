Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 7, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 6

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern, which consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Here are the steps to find them:

1. Identify nodes connected to exactly three other nodes:
    - Nodes: 1, 2, 3, 6, 7

2. For each of these nodes, check their connections to find 3-star patterns:
    - For node 1: (1, 0, 5, 6)
    - For node 2: (2, 3, 6, 9)
    - For node 3: (3, 2, 7, 9)
    - For node 6: (6, 1, 2, 7, 9)
    - For node 7: (7, 3, 6, 8)

Therefore, there are a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars: 
<1, (0, 5, 6)>
<2, (3, 6, 9)>
<3, (2, 7, 9)>
<6, (1, 2, 7, 9)>
<7, (3, 6, 8)>
