Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 4, 5, and node 8

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find the 3-stars by identifying nodes which have exactly 3 edges connected to them. 

The nodes with exactly 3 edges connected to them are: 0, 2, 8, 1, 7. 

Let's find the 3-stars involving these nodes:
- For node 0: <0, (2, 6, 9)>
- For node 2: <2, (0, 8, 9)>
- For node 8: <8, (2, 9, 0)>
- For node 1: <1, (6, 0, 3)>
- For node 7: <7, (6, 0, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
