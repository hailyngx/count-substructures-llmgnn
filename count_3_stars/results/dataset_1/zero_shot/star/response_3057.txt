Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<3, (1, 2, 6)>
<5, (4, 6, 7)>
<6, (1, 3, 5)>
<7, (3, 5, 6)>
<9, (0, 7, 8)>
<1, (3, 6, 9)>
<2, (3, 4, 5)>
<4, (2, 5, 6)>
