Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (5, 7, 8)>
<1, (2, 4, 5)>
<2, (1, 3, 6)>
<2, (3, 5, 9)>
<2, (6, 9, 1)>
