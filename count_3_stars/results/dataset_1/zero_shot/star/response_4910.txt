Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The center node in a 3-star has degree 3, which means it is connected to three other nodes. Let's find all the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (2, 4, 9)>
2. <1, (8, 9, 5)>
3. <2, (7, 5, 0)>
4. <5, (8, 9, 2)>
5. <9, (0, 1, 5)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
