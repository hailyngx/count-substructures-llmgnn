Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].  

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:  
<0, (3, 8, 5)>  
<1, (7, 9, 4)>  
<2, (3, 4, 6)>  
<3, (0, 2, 6)>  
<4, (2, 7, 9)>  
<5, (8, 0, -)>  
<6, (3, -, -)>  
<7, (1, 4, -)>  
<8, (0, 5, -)>  
<9, (1, 4, -)>
