Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The count of the 3-stars is [4].
The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (7, 8, 2)>
<2, (1, 6, 7)>
<5, (3, 7, 9)>
<7, (0, 8, 9)>
