Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are 3-stars in this graph. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<1, (0, 3, 8)>
<2, (3, 5, 6)>
<3, (1, 2, 9)>
<4, (0, 6, 9)> 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
