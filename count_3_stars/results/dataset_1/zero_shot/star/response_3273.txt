Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars: 
<0, (5, 6, 7)>
<0, (5, 7, 9)>
<2, (4, 5, 7)>
<3, (1, 5, 6)>
<3, (5, 6, 7)>
<7, (0, 4, 8)>
