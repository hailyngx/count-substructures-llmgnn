Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of [9] 3-stars in the given graph. 
The unique 3-stars are:
<3, (4, 5, 8)>
<4, (3, 5, 7)>
<5, (3, 4, 9)>
<6, (1, 7, 8)>
<7, (0, 4, 6)>
<8, (2, 3, 9)>
<9, (1, 3, 8)>
<0, (2, 7, 4)>
<1, (6, 9, 0)>
