Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph. 
The unique 3-stars are <0, (1, 5, 7)>, <1, (0, 3, 4)>, <5, (0, 1, 4)>, <3, (1, 5, 6)>, <7, (0, 6, 8)>, and <9, (1, 4, 7)>.
