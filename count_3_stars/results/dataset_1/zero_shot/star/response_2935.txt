Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 7) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
The unique 3-stars found are <0, (2, 7, 8)>, <1, (5, 6, 9)>, <6, (1, 7, 9)>, <7, (0, 2, 9)>.
