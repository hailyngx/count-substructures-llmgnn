Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [5] 3-stars in the given graph represented by the following unique combinations:
<0, (3, 6, 8)>, <1, (5, 6, 9)>, <3, (0, 6, 8)>, <5, (1, 7, 9)>, <7, (4, 5, 9)>
