Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
Counting the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (3, 4, 7)>
2. <1, (3, 5, 6)>
3. <1, (3, 6, 9)>
4. <3, (0, 1, 5)>
5. <3, (0, 5, 7)>
6. <3, (1, 5, 9)>
7. <4, (0, 2, 6)>
8. <4, (2, 6, 7)>
9. <5, (1, 3, 9)>
10. <6, (1, 4, 7)>
11. <7, (0, 3, 4)>
12. <7, (3, 4, 6)>
13. <8, (0, 3, 9)>
14. <9, (1, 3, 6)>
15. <9, (1, 6, 9)>
16. <9, (2, 3, 4)>
17. <9, (2, 4, 6)>

Therefore, there are a total of [17] 3-stars in the given graph.
