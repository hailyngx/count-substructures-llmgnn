Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
The graph contains the following 3-stars: 
[<1, (2, 7, 9)>, <2, (1, 6, 7)>, <6, (2, 3, 8)>]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
