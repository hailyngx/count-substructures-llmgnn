Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are 10 nodes and 40 edges in this graph. To count the number of 3-stars, we need to identify all the occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern.

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<1, (4, 5, 6)>
<2, (0, 4, 5)>
<3, (0, 5, 9)>
<4, (0, 1, 2)>
<5, (1, 2, 3)>
<6, (1, 2, 8)>
<7, (0, 5, 8)>
<8, (1, 4, 6)>
<9, (3, 5, 9)>

There are a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
