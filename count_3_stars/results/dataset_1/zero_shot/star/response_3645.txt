Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph.  
The 3-stars are:  
<0, (2, 4, 8)>  
<8, (0, 3, 9)>  
So the final answer is [2].
