Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are 5 total 3-stars in the given graph, which can be listed as follows:

<0, (4, 5, 9)>
<1, (4, 5, 2)>
<2, (3, 5, 6)>
<3, (2, 5, 7)>
<4, (0, 1, 6)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
