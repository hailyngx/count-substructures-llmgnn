Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph consists of the following 3-stars:
[<0, (1, 2, 5)>, <1, (0, 5, 8)>, <2, (0, 7, 9)>, <3, (4, 6, 8)>, <4, (3, 9, 0)>, <5, (0, 1, 8)>, <6, (3, 7, 8)>, <7, (2, 6, 9)>, <8, (1, 3, 6)>, <9, (2, 4, 7)>]
