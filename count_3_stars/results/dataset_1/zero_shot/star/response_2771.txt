Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are two 3-stars in the given graph. Here are the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (2, 5, 3)>
<9, (8, 7, 5)>
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [2].
