Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 5, 4)>
<1, (0, 5, 8)>
<4, (1, 8, 2)>
<7, (2, 3, 9)>
<9, (6, 7, 9)>
