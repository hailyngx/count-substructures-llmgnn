Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
The total number of 3-star graphs can be calculated by counting how many nodes in the graph have exactly three neighbors. Let's first identify those nodes:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: Node 3, Node 8, Node 9
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors: Node 2, Node 3, Node 4, Node 5, Node 6
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: Node 1, Node 5, Node 7
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: Node 0, Node 1, Node 4, Node 8
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: Node 1, Node 3, Node 7, Node 8
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: Node 1, Node 2, Node 7, Node 8
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: Node 1, Node 7, Node 8, Node 9
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: Node 2, Node 4, Node 5, Node 6
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors: Node 0, Node 3, Node 4, Node 5, Node 6
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors: Node 0, Node 6

From the above analysis, we can see that only Node 0 and Node 2 satisfy the condition of being the center of a 3-star graph as they have exactly 3 neighbors each. Therefore, the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [2].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 8, 9)>
<2, (1, 5, 7)>
