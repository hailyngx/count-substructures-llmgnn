Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

The 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 5, 7)>
<1, (2, 3, 5)>
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<2, (1, 3, 5)>
<3, (1, 2, 4)>
<5, (0, 1, 9)>
