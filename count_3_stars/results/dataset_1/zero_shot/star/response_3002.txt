Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph. 

Unique 3-stars: 
<0, (4, 6, 7)>
<1, (6, 8, 2)>
<2, (6, 9, 1)>
<4, (0, 8, 9)>
<6, (0, 1, 2)>
<8, (1, 3, 9)>
