Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 2) (6, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 8 unique 3-stars in this graph. 

The 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 5, 9)>
<1, (0, 2, 5)>
<2, (1, 3, 6)>
<3, (2, 8, 9)>
<4, (8, 9, 5)>
<5, (1, 9, 4)>
<6, (2, 9, 8)>
<8, (3, 4, 9)>  

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
