Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [8] 3-stars in the given graph.  

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (2, 5, 8)>
<1, (2, 7, 8)>
<2, (0, 1, 8)>
<2, (5, 8, 9)>
<3, (8, 4, 9)>
<4, (8, 6, 9)>
<5, (0, 2, 8)>
<6, (8, 4, 9)>
