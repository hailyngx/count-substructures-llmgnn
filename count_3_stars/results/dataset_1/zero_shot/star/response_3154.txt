Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph. 
The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (4, 9, 1)>
<3, (4, 5, 8)>
<4, (0, 1, 3)>
<6, (4, 5, 9)>
