Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

The 3-stars are:
1. <0, (1, 4, 8)>
2. <1, (0, 2, 6)>
3. <4, (0, 5, 6)>
4. <6, (1, 2, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
