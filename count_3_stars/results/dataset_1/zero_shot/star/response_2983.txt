Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
  
The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (3, 4, 6)>
<3, (1, 2, 5)>
<3, (2, 5, 8)>
<5, (3, 6, 8)>
<6, (1, 2, 9)>
<8, (3, 5, 7)>
