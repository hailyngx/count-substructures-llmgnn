Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].

The 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (3, 8, 3)>
<2, (1, 4, 5)>
<4, (2, 8, 9)>
<5, (3, 2, 3)>
<8, (0, 3, 4)>
