Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:
Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: [(0, 5), (0, 7), (1, 9), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 2), (3, 5), (4, 2), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (5, 7), (5, 9), (6, 5), (6, 8), (6, 9), (7, 0), (7, 5), (8, 6), (9, 1), (9, 5), (9, 6)]

Now, let's find the 3-star subgraphs in this graph.

The 3-star subgraphs in the given graph are:
<0, (5, 7, 5)>
<1, (9, 1, 9)>
<2, (3, 4, 5)>
<3, (2, 5, 4)>
<4, (2, 5, 3)>
<5, (0, 2, 3)>
<6, (5, 8, 9)>
<7, (0, 5, 0)>
<8, (6, 6, 6)>
<9, (1, 9, 6)>

Count of 3-star subgraphs: [9]
