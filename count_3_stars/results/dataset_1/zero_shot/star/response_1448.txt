Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 8.
- Node 2 is connected to node 7.
- Node 3 is connected to node 4.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1 and 7.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 8 and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1 and 6.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 7.

To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we identify the 3-stars formed by the central node and its three connected nodes:
1. <1, (4, 5, 8)>
2. <4, (1, 3, 9)>
3. <5, (1, 7, -)>
4. <8, (1, 6, -)>
5. <2, (7, -, -)>
6. <3, (4, -, -)>
7. <6, (8, 9, -)>
8. <7, (2, 5, 9)>
9. <9, (4, 6, 7)>

Count of 3-stars: [9]
