Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The graph contains the following 3-stars:

[<0, (1, 2, 4)>, <2, (0, 5, 8)>, <4, (1, 7, 9)>, <5, (2, 6, 9)>, <6, (5, 8),> <7, (3, 4)>, <8, (2, 6)>, <9, (4, 5)>]

Therefore, there are 8 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The answer is [8].
