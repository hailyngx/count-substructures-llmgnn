Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of [4] 3-star subgraphs in the given graph.

<0, (3, 7, 8)>
<2, (1, 5, 6)>
<4, (6, 7, -)>
<9, (0, 1, 8)>
