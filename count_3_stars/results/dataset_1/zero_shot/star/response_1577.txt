Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be determined by looking at each node and counting how many ways it can form a 3-star.

The nodes and their corresponding 3-star configurations are as follows:
- Node 0: <0, (2, 3, 6)>, <0, (2, 6, 8)>, <0, (3, 6, 9)>, <0, (8, 9, 2)>
- Node 1: <1, (2, 9, 0)>
- Node 2: <2, (0, 1, 4)>, <2, (0, 4, 8)>
- Node 3: <3, (0, 6, 9)>
- Node 4: <4, (2, 5, 8)>
- Node 5: <5, (4, 6, 9)>
- Node 6: <6, (0, 5, 9)>, <6, (5, 7, 9)>, <6, (7, 9, 0)>
- Node 7: <7, (6, 9, 0)>
- Node 8: <8, (0, 4, 9)>
- Node 9: No valid 3-star can be formed with node 9 as the center.

Counting the unique 3-stars, we have <0, (2, 3, 6)>, <0, (2, 6, 8)>, <0, (3, 6, 9)>, <0, (8, 9, 2)>, <1, (2, 9, 0)>, <2, (0, 1, 4)>, <2, (0, 4, 8)>, <3, (0, 6, 9)>, <4, (2, 5, 8)>, <5, (4, 6, 9)>, <6, (0, 5, 9)>, <6, (5, 7, 9)>, <6, (7, 9, 0)>, <7, (6, 9, 0)>, <8, (0, 4, 9)>. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [14].
