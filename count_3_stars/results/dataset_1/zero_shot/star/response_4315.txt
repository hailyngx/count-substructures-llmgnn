Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].  
The unique 3-stars are:  
<0, (4, 6, 9)>  
<2, (5, 7, 8)>  
<3, (5, 6, 8)>
