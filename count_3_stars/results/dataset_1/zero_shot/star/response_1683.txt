Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<1, (2, 5, 7)>
<3, (0, 2, 5)>
<4, (0, 3, 6)>
