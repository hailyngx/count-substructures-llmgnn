Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the final answer is [6].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 4, 8)>
<1, (6, 7, 5)>
<2, (0, 4, 3)>
<3, (2, 6, 8)>
<4, (0, 2, 8)>
<5, (4, 6, 8)>
