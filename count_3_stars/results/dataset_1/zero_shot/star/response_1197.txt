Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
    
    <0, (5, 1, 2)>
    <1, (3, 6, 7)>
    <2, (4, 8, 9)>
    <3, (1, 6, 9)>
    <4, (2, 8, 9)>
    <5, (0, 1, 2)>
    <6, (1, 3, 7)>
    <9, (2, 3, 4)>
