Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 5 3-stars in the given graph. The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<1, (0, 3, 5)>
<4, (0, 7, 9)>
<6, (0, 3, 7)>
<9, (2, 4, 6)>
Therefore, the final answer is [5].
