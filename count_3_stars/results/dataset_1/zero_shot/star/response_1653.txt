Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 8) (3, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph can be visually represented as follows:

```
    0 -- 1 -- 5
    |         |
    7 -- 3    8
    |      \ / 
    1       2
             \
              4
              |
              9
              |
              6
```

Based on the definition of a 3-star graph, we can identify the 3-stars present in the given graph. 

The 3-stars in the graph are:
<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<1, (0, 5, 7)>
<2, (8, 4, 9)>
<3, (7, 1, 8)>
<4, (8, 2, 9)>
<5, (1, 0, 7)>
<6, (9, 4, 8)>
<7, (1, 5, 3)>
<8, (2, 4, 9)>
<9, (6, 8, 4)>

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 10. 

Therefore, the final answer is [10].
