Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are a total of 6 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are listed below:

[<0, (1, 6, 7)>]
[<1, (0, 9, 2)>]
[<3, (4, 5, -)>]
[<4, (3, 7, 8)>]
[<6, (0, 2, 5)>]
[<9, (1, 2, 4)>]
