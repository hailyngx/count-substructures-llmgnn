Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:
[<0, (3, 8, 9)>, <1, (3, 6, 2)>, <2, (1, 3, 6)>, <4, (3, 6, 7)>, <5, (4, 6, 7)>, <6, (1, 4, 5)>]
Therefore, there are a total of 6 unique 3-stars in the graph. The answer is [6].
