Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) 

Response:
There are [2] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<6, (1, 2, 7)>
