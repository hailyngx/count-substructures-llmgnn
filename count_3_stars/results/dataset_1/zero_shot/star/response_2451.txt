Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph.  

The unique 3-stars are:  
<0, (5, 7, 9)>  
<1, (7, 8, 9)>  
<3, (2, 4, 6)>  
<4, (3, 6, 9)>  
<6, (3, 4, 8)>  
<8, (1, 2, 6)>
