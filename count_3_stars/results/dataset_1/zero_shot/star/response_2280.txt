Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are:

<1, (3, 6, 9)>
<3, (1, 5, 7)>
<4, (5, 6, 7)>
<5, (3, 4, 6)>
<6, (1, 4, 5)>
<7, (3, 4, 5)>
<9, (4, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
