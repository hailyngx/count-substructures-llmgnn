Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:
[<0, (1, 2, 8)>, <2, (0, 3, 9)>, <4, (3, 7, -)>, <5, (6, 9, -)>, <6, (5, -, -)>, <7, (4, -, -)>, <8, (0, 9, -)>, <9, (1, 2, 5)>]

Therefore, there are a total of [8] 3-stars in the graph.
