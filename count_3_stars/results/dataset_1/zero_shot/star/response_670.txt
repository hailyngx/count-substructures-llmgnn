Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) 

Response:
There are 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The final count is [2].
   
   The two unique 3-stars are:
   <0, (4, 9, 6)>
   <1, (2, 8, 1)>
