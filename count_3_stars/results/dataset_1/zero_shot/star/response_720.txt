Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph: <0, (3, 7, 6)>, <1, (2, 8, 7)>, <4, (5, 8, 6)>, and <9, (8, 6, 7)>.
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
