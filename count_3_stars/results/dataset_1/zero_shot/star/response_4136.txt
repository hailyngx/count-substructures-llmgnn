Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here are the unique 3-stars found: 
    <0, (6, 8, 9)>
    <3, (1, 2, 9)>
    
    Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
