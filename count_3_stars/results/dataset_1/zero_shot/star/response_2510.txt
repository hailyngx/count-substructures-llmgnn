Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 3-stars among the nodes. 

The number of 3-stars is [4].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<5, (1, 3, 8)>
<5, (3, 6, 9)>
<8, (7, 8, 9)>
