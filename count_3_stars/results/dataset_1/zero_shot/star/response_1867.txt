Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be found by counting the number of times a node appears as the center in a 3-star configuration. Let's go through each node to identify the 3-stars:

- Node 0: <0, (2, 3, 6)>
- Node 1: No 3-star configuration
- Node 2: <2, (0, 4, 9)>
- Node 3: <3, (0, 4, 6)>
- Node 4: No 3-star configuration
- Node 6: No 3-star configuration
- Node 7: <7, (1, 9, 7)>
- Node 9: No 3-star configuration

Counting the unique 3-stars found above, we get a total of [4] 3-stars in the graph.
