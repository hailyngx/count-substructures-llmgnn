Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 7 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The 3-stars are as follows:
    <0, (7, 8, 0)>
    <1, (7, 4, 6)>
    <2, (5, 8, 0)>
    <3, (1, 5, 7)>
    <4, (1, 6, 7)>
    <5, (9, 8, 2)>
    <6, (4, 1, 7)>
    
    Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
