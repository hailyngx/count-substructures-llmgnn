Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are [5] 3-stars in this graph. 
The unique 3-stars found are <0, (5, 7, 8)>, <1, (4, 6, 9)>, <2, (3, 8, 9)>, <3, (2, 4, 6)>, and <4, (1, 3, 5)>.
