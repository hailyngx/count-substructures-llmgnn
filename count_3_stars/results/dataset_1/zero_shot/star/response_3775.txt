Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here is the list of 3-stars with their central node and leaf nodes:

<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<2, (1, 5, 6)>
<3, (0, 5, 9)>
<6, (0, 2, 7)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
