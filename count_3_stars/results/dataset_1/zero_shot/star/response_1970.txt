Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 3 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The answer is [3].

The 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<2, (1, 4, 9)>
<4, (0, 2, 3)>
