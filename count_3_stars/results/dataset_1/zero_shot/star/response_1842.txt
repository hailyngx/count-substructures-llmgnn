Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 3 unique 3-stars in the given graph.  

The 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 4, 7)>
<0, (3, 7, 8)>
<0, (3, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
