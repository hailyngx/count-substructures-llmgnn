Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) 

Response:
There are 4 different 3-stars in the given graph. The unique 3-stars are listed below:

<1, (3, 7, 8)>
<3, (1, 8, 8)>
<4, (8, 5, 6)>
<5, (8, 4, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
