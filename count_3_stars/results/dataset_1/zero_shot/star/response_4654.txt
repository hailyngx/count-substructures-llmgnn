Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are:

1. <0, (1, 2, 8)>
2. <1, (0, 6, 8)>
3. <3, (4, 7, 8)>
4. <7, (1, 3, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
