Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:
[<1, (0, 5, 6)>, <3, (2, 4, 8)>, <4, (3, 5, 9)>]
There are **3** 3-stars in the given graph. Thus, the final answer is [3].
