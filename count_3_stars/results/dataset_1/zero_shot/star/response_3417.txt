Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph contains the following 3-star structures:
[<0, (6, 9, x)>]  
[<2, (1, 7, 9)>]  
[<4, (5, 9, x)>]  
[<5, (4, 7, x)>]  
[<7, (2, 5, 8)>]  
[<9, (0, 2, 4)>]  

Therefore, there are a total of [6] 3-stars in the graph.
