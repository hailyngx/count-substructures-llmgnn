Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:
- <1, (2, 4, 6)>
- <2, (1, 7, 9)>
- <4, (1, 8, 8)>
- <6, (1, 5, 8)>
- <8, (2, 4, 6)>

Therefore, there are a total of [5] 3-stars in the graph.
