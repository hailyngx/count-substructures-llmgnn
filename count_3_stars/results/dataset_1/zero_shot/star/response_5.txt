Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<5, (2, 6, 8)>
