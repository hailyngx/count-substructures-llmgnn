Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in this graph. They are:

<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<2, (0, 4, 6)>
<3, (2, 4, 6)>
<4, (0, 2, 6)>
<5, (3, 4, 8)>
<6, (0, 2, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
