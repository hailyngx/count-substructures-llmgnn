Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (3, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are two 3-star subgraphs in the given graph. Here they are:
<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<6, (1, 5, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
