Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
The unique 3-stars found are: <1, (2, 4, 5)>, <3, (8, 9, 5)>, <5, (7, 3, 1)>, <7, (2, 5, 8)>, <8, (3, 6, 7)>.
