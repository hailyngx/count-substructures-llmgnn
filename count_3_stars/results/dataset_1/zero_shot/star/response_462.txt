Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:

[<0, (4, 6, 9)>, <1, (2, 5, 9)>, <2, (1, 7, 9)>, <3, (5, 7, 8)>, <4, (0, 6, 9)>, <5, (1, 3, 7)>, <6, (0, 8, 9)>, <7, (2, 3, 5)>, <8, (3, 6, 9)>, <9, (0, 1, 2)>]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
