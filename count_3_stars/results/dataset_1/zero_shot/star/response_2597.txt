Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are:

<0, (3, 6, 9)>
<1, (5, 6, 7)>
<2, (5, 1, 0)>
<3, (0, 6, 1)>
<4, (7, 9, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
