Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 3-stars present in this graph. The unique 3-stars found are:

<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<1, (0, 6, 9)>
<2, (4, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
