Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can identify the central node and its adjacent nodes. 

The central nodes with their adjacent nodes are as follows:
- Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 2: 1, 3, 4, 9
- Node 3: 1, 2, 5, 9

By examining the list above, we can see that the graph contains the following unique 3-stars:
<1, (0, 2, 9)>
<1, (6, 7, 8)>
<2, (1, 3, 9)>
<3, (2, 5, 9)>

Now we can count the total number of 3-stars by counting the unique ones we found:
