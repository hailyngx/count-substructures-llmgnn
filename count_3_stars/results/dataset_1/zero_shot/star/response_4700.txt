Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph:
1. <1, (0, 5, 6)>
2. <2, (3, 7, 8)>
3. <3, (2, 4, 9)>
4. <4, (7, 9, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
