Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 6) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are a total of [8] 3-star structures in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (0, 4, 7)>
<1, (4, 6, 7)>
<6, (2, 3, 5)>
<4, (1, 6, 9)>
<6, (1, 2, 3)>
<6, (1, 4, 5)>
<1, (6, 4, 7)>
<6, (1, 4, 5)>
