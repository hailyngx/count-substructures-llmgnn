Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The graph contains the following 3-stars:
- <0, (1, 2, 4)>
- <1, (0, 2, 3)>
- <2, (0, 1, 4)>
- <3, (1, 7, 8)>
- <4, (2, 6, 9)>
- <5, (2, 8)>
- <6, (2, 4)>
- <7, (2, 3)>
- <8, (3, 5)>
- <9, (3, 4)>

There are a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
