Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of 9 3-stars in this graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 6, 7)>
<0, (3, 8, 9)>
<1, (3, 6, 9)>
<2, (3, 5, 6)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<4, (3, 8, 9)>
<5, (2, 3, 6)>
<8, (4, 5, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 8)>

Therefore, the final answer is [9].
