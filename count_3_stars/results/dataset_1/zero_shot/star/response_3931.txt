Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph contains the following 3-star structures:

[<0, (4, 6, 9)>, <1, (2, 5, 6)>, <3, (5, 6, 8)>]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
