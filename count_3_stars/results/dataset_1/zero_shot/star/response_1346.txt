Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are:

<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<0, (5, 6, 8)>
<1, (0, 5, 7)>
<4, (2, 6, 7)>
<7, (8, 9, 1)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
