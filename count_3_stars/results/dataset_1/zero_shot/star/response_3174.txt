Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
Here they are: 
<0, (1, 3, 6)>
<0, (1, 3, 8)>
<3, (0, 1, 4)>
<3, (4, 8, 9)>
<4, (3, 5, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
