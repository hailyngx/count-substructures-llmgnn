Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are:
[<0, (3, 4, 5)> <0, (4, 5, 7)> <0, (5, 7, 9)> <1, (5, 6, 7)> <1, (5, 7, 8)> <1, (7, 8, 9)> <5, (0, 1, 2)> <5, (0, 1, 4)> <5, (0, 2, 5)> <5, (1, 4, 6)> <5, (4, 6, 7)> <5, (4, 7, 8)> <5, (7, 8, 9)> <6, (1, 4, 9)> <8, (1, 5, 7)> <8, (5, 7, 9)>]
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [16].
