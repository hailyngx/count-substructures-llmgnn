This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 5, 7)>
<6, (0, 1, 7)>
