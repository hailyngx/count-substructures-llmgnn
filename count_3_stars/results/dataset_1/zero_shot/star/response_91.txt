Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (0, 2, 9)>
<2, (1, 6, 9)>
<6, (2, 4, 8)>
