Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are a total of [14] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<1, (0, 3, 5)>
<2, (0, 4, 5)>
<3, (0, 1, 4)>
<4, (2, 3, -)>
<5, (1, 2, 6)>
<6, (2, 5, 9)>
<7, (8, 9, -)>
<8, (7, 5, -)>
<9, (1, 2, 6)>
