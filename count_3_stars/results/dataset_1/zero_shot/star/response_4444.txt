Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars: 

[<0, (1, 2, 6)>, <1, (0, 4, 5)>, <2, (0, 5, 8)>, <3, (6, 8, 9)>, <4, (1, 9, 5)>, <5, (1, 2, 8)>, <6, (0, 3, 8)>, <7, (8, 9, 1)>, <8, (1, 5, 6)>, <9, (1, 4, 5)>]

Therefore, there are [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
