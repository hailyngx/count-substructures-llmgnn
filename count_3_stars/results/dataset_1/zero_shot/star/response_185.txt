Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars: [<0, (1, 2, 9)>, <1, (0, 6, 7)>, <4, (5, 7, 8)>, <2, (0, 5, 7)>, <5, (2, 4, 7)>, <7, (1, 2, 4)>, <9, (0, 1, 4)>]

There are 7 unique 3-stars in this graph. The total count of 3-stars is [7].
