Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph: <3, (0, 1, 2)> and <4, (0, 1, 9)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
