Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of 3-star configurations in the given graph can be calculated by identifying all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes in the graph. 

In this graph:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 4
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 7
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 7
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 5
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 9

Therefore, the 3-stars in the given graph are:
- <0, (1, 2, 4)>
- <1, (0, 3, 7)>
- <2, (0, 4, 7)>
- <4, (0, 2, 5)>
- <7, (0, 1, 9)>

There are a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
