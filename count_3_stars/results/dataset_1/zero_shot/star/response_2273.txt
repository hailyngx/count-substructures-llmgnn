Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are <0, (5, 7, 8)>, <1, (4, 9, -)>, <3, (4, 6, 7)>, <4, (1, 3, 9)>, <5, (0, 2, 7)>, <7, (0, 3, 5)>, <9, (1, 4, 7)>. Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
