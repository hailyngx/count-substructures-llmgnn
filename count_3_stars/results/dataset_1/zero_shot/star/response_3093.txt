Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are a total of 8 unique 3-stars in this graph. Here they are listed below:

<0, (2, 6, 7)>
<0, (6, 7, 8)>
<0, (7, 5, 8)>
<0, (7, 8, 6)>
<1, (5, 8, 9)>
<2, (0, 6, 7)>
<5, (1, 7, 8)>
<7, (0, 6, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
