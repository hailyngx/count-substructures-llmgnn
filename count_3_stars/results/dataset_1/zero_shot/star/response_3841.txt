Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are two 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are:

<0, (1, 9, 4)>
<3, (4, 6, 8)>

The number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
