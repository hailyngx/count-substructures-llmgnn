Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (3, 8) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [3] 3-stars in the given graph.  
The unique 3-stars are <0, (5, 6, 8)>, <1, (2, 7, 9)>, and <8, (0, 3, 9)>.
