Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 8 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The 3-stars are:
  
1. <0, (3, 6, 7)>
2. <0, (3, 7, 8)>
3. <1, (2, 4, 8)>
4. <1, (3, 4, 8)>
5. <3, (0, 1, 4)>
6. <3, (4, 7, 8)>
7. <4, (1, 3, 8)>
8. <5, (4, 6, 8)>
  
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
