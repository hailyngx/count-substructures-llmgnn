Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of 6 unique 3-stars in the graph. Here they are listed inside <>:

<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<1, (3, 5, 9)>
<2, (8, 3, 9)>
<3, (1, 8, 9)>
<4, (7, 5, 9)>
<6, (5, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
