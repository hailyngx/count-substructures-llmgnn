Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in this graph is [8].  
The unique 3-stars found are <0, (4, 5, 8)>, <1, (5, 8, 2)>, <2, (8, 4, 1)>, <3, (7, 9, 4)>, <4, (0, 2, 8)>, <5, (1, 6, 0)>, <7, (3, 8, 9)>, and <9, (7, 4, 3)>.
