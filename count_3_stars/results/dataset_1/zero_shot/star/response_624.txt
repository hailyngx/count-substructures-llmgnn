Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are [5] 3-stars in the given graph. 

Unique 3-stars: 
<0, (4, 9, 0)>
<1, (3, 7, 9)>
<2, (3, 5, 7)>
<3, (1, 2, 5)>
<9, (0, 1, 2)>
