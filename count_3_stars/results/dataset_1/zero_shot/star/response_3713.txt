Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be found by counting the number of possible central nodes (nodes with exactly 3 neighbors) in the graph. Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- The 3-stars can have central nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, or 9.
- Node 0: (0, 1, 3) and (0, 6, 7) are the only 3-stars with 0 as the central node.
- Node 1: (1, 0, 3) is the only 3-star with 1 as the central node.
- Node 2: No 3-stars as 2 does not have exactly 3 neighbors.
- Node 3: (3, 0, 1) and (3, 6, 7) are the only 3-stars with 3 as the central node.
- Node 6: (6, 0, 7), (6, 1, 3), and (6, 2, 9) are the 3-stars with 6 as the central node.
- Node 7: (7, 0, 6) and (7, 2, 8) are the 3-stars with 7 as the central node.
- Node 8: No 3-stars as 8 does not have exactly 3 neighbors.
- Node 9: (9, 0, 6) and (9, 2, 3) are the only 3-stars with 9 as the central node.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8] and they are:
<0, (1, 3, 6)>, <0, (6, 7, 0)>, <3, (0, 1, 6)>, <3, (3, 6, 7)>, <6, (0, 7, 6)>, <6, (1, 3, 6)>, <6, (2, 6, 9)>, <9, (0, 6, 9)>
