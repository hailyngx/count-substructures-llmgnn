Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 4) (7, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
The central nodes in this graph are nodes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. Let's analyze each one to count the number of 3-stars for each:

For node 1:
- (1, 4, 5)
- (1, 4, 9)
- (1, 5, 9)
Total 3-stars for node 1: 3

For node 3:
- (3, 7, 9)
Total 3-stars for node 3: 1

For node 4:
- (4, 1, 6)
- (4, 1, 8)
Total 3-stars for node 4: 2

For node 5:
No 3-stars can be formed with node 5.

For node 6:
No 3-stars can be formed with node 6.

For node 7:
No 3-stars can be formed with node 7.

For node 8:
No 3-stars can be formed with node 8.

For node 9:
No 3-stars can be formed with node 9.

Therefore, a total of 3-stars in the given graph: [6]
Unique 3-stars: <<1, (4, 5, 9)>, <1, (4, 6, 8)>, <3, (7, 9)> >
