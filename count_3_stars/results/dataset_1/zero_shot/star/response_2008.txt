Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 6) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 3, 6)>
<1, (0, 6, 7)>
<2, (4, 6, 5)>
<3, (0, 4, 5)>
<6, (1, 2, 7)>
