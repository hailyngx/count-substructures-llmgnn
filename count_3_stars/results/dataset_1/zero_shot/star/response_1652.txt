Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph can be counted as follows:

1. For node 0, there are 4 potential 3-stars: <0, (1, 4, 5)>, <0, (1, 2, 8)>, <0, (2, 5, 8)>, <0, (4, 7, 8)>
2. For node 1, there is 1 potential 3-star: <1, (0, 2, 3)>
3. For node 2, there is 1 potential 3-star: <2, (0, 1, 5)>
4. For node 3, there is no 3-star.
5. For node 4, there is no 3-star.
6. For node 5, there is no 3-star.
7. For node 6, there is no 3-star.
8. For node 7, there is no 3-star.
9. For node 8, there is no 3-star.
10. For node 9, there is no 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6]. The unique 3-stars are <0, (1, 4, 5)>, <0, (1, 2, 8)>, <0, (2, 5, 8)>, <0, (4, 7, 8)>, <1, (0, 2, 3)>.
