Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [2] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (2, 8, 5)>
<3, (2, 5, 9)>
