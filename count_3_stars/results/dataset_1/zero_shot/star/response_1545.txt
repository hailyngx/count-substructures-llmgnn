Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are a total of 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are:

<0, (1, 4, 9)>
<1, (0, 3, 5)>
<3, (1, 6, 9)>
<4, (0, 2, 5)>
<5, (1, 4, 6)>
<6, (3, 5, 9)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
