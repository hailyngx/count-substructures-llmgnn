Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are:

<1, (0, 5, 6)>
<5, (1, 2, 4)>
<8, (1, 5, 9)>
<9, (1, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
