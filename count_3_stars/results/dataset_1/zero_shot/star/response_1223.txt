Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 7) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are <0, (2, 5, 1)>, <2, (0, 8, 5)>, and <6, (1, 4, 9)> 3-stars in the given graph.  
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [3].
