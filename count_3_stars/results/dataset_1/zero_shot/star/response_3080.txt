Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:

[<0, (9, 6, 8)>, <1, (2, 4, 5)>, <2, (1, 4, 5)>, <3, (6, 9, 8)>, <4, (2, 5, 8)>, <5, (1, 2, 7)>, <6, (3, 9, 8)>, <7, (1, 5, 8)>, <8, (5, 7, 9)>, <9, (0, 6, 8)>]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
