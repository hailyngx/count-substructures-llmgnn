Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are three 3-stars in the given graph. 
The unique 3-stars are as follows: 
<0, (3, 7, 8)>
<1, (4, 7, 9)>
<6, (0, 2, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
