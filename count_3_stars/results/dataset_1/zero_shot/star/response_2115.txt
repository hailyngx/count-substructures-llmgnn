Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in this graph is [5].
  
The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (8, 9, 1)>
<1, (8, 0, 5)>
<2, (8, 9, 7)>
<3, (8, 6, 7)>
<3, (8, 4, 1)>
