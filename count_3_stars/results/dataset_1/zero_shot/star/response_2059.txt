Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are [3] 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (8, 1, 3)>
<2, (3, 4, 5)>
<8, (0, 1, 3)>
