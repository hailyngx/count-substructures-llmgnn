Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the final answer is [4].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<2, (4, 7, 8)>
<3, (1, 2, 6)>
<4, (0, 2, 5)>
<5, (2, 4, 6)>
