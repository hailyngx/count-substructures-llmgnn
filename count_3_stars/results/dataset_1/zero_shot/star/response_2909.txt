Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are four 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 3, 5)>
<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<3, (0, 4, 6)>
<5, (0, 1, 8)>

Therefore, the final count is [4].
