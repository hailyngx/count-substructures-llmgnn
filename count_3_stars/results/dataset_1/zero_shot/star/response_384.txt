Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:
```
0 --- 4
|\   /|
| \ / |
|  1  |
| / \ |
|/   \|
5     2 --- 6
         |
        3
         |
         9
         |
         7 --- 8
```

Given the graph structure, the 3-stars are as follows:
[<0, (4, 5, 8)>, <2, (4, 6, 9)>]
