Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 5, 8)>
