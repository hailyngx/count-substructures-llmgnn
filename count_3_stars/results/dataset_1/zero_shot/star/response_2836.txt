Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The graph has the following 3-stars:
[<0, (3, 8, 0)>, <1, (2, 9, 1)>, <2, (1, 3, 7)>, <3, (0, 2, 4)>, <4, (3, 7, 8)>, <5, (4, 7, 9)>, <7, (2, 4, 5)>, <8, (0, 4, 6)>, <9, (1, 5, 7)>]

Count of 3-stars: [9]
