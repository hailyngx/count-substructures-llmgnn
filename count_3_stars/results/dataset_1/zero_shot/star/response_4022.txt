Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (5, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:
[6] -> <6, (3, 7, 9)>
[8] -> <8, (2, 3, 9)>
[6] -> <6, (3, 7, 9)>
[7] -> <7, (0, 1, 6)>
[3] -> <3, (0, 1, 2)>
[3] -> <3, (1, 2, 6)>
[3] -> <3, (0, 2, 8)>
[9] -> <9, (0, 6, 8)>

Therefore, there are a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
