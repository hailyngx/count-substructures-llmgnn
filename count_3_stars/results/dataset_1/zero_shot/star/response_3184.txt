Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (4, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 8, 9)>
<1, (0, 8, 9)>
<5, (2, 6, 7)>
<6, (0, 5, 7)>
<8, (0, 1, 5)>
