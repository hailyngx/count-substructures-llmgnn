Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 4) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be calculated by counting the number of unique 3-stars. Let's list the unique 3-stars first:

<0, (1, 2, 9)>
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<2, (0, 1, 8)>
<3, (1, 3, 9)>
<4, (5, 6, 8)>
<5, (4, 6, 8)>
<6, (4, 7, 9)>
<7, (1, 6, 8)>
<8, (2, 4, 5)>
<9, (0, 3, 6)>

Now, since each 3-star can be rotated to form 3 different configurations while still being considered the same 3-star, we need to divide the count of unique 3-stars by 3 to get the total number of 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
