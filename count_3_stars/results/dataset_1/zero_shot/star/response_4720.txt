Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars are:
<3, (0, 1, 5)>
<1, (4, 7, 8)>
<5, (3, 6, 9)>
<7, (1, 2, 4)>
