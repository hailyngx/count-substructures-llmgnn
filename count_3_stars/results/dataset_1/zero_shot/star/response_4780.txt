Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<1, (3, 9, 4)>
<2, (3, 5, 7)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<3, (4, 1, 9)>
<4, (1, 3, 9)>
<5, (0, 2, 7)>
<6, (0, 1, 7)>
<7, (0, 2, 9)>
<9, (1, 4, 7)>
