Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 3 unique 3-stars in the given graph.  
The 3-stars found are:  
<0, (5, 7, 9)>  
<1, (2, 3, 4)>  
<9, (0, 3, 4)>  
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
