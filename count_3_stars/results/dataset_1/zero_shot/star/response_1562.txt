Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<3, (0, 5, 6)>
<4, (1, 8, 9)>
<5, (0, 3, 6)>
