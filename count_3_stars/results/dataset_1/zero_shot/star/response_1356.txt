Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 8) (4, 0) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 6, 8)>
<6, (1, 5, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
