Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (5, 6, 9)>
<1, (3, 4, 5)>
<2, (3, 6, 8)>
