Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 3-stars in this graph. Here is the list of unique 3-stars:
<0, (5, 7, 8)>
<1, (2, 4, 9)>
<2, (1, 4, 8)>
<3, (5, 6, 9)>  
<4, (1, 2, 7)>  
<5, (0, 3, 8)>  
<6, (2, 3, 8)>  
<7, (0, 4, 9)>  
<8, (0, 2, 5)>  
<9, (0, 1, 6)>
