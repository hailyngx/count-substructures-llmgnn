Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].  
The unique 3-stars are:  
<0, (3, 9, 4)>  
<1, (2, 4, 8)>  
<2, (1, 4, 8)>  
<3, (0, 7, 9)>  
<4, (1, 2, 8)>  
<7, (3, 4, 5)>
