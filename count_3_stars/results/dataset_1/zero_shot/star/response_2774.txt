Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph contains the following 3-stars: 
<0, (2, 7, 9)>
<2, (0, 4, 5)>
<3, (1, 2, 7)>
<4, (2, 7, -)>
<5, (2, -, -)>
<6, (2, 9, -)>
<7, (0, 1, 4)>
<9, (0, 6, -)>

Therefore, there are a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
