Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 3-star structures in the graph. Let's list them:

<0, (1, 6, 9)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<3, (1, 2, 9)>
<4, (1, 2, 6)>
<6, (0, 4, 9)>
<8, (5, 7, 9)>
<9, (1, 3, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
