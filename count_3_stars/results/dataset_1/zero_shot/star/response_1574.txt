Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are [3] 3-star structures in the given graph.  
The unique 3-stars are:  
<0, (1, 7, 8)>  
<1, (0, 2, 6)>  
<8, (0, 1, 6)>
