Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph can be calculated by identifying the nodes that form 3-stars around each central node. Since each 3-star consists of a central node and three leaves, we look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

Looking at the provided edges again, we can list the unique 3-stars:
<0, (2, 4, 8)>
<1, (2, 7, -)>
<2, (0, 1, 6)>
<3, (5, -, -)>
<4, (0, 5, 6)>
<5, (3, 4, 8)>
<6, (2, 4, 7)>
<7, (1, 2, 6)>
<8, (0, 5, 6)>
<9, (4, 6, 7)>

There are 10 unique 3-stars in total, so the final answer is [10].
