Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 8 unique 3-stars in this graph. 

The 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<1, (2, 3, 4)>
<2, (1, 5, 7)>
<2, (0, 5, 8)>
<3, (0, 4, 6)>
<4, (0, 3, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
