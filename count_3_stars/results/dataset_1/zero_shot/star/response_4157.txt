Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are \[3\] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 2, 7)>
<2, (0, 3, 7)>
<3, (8, 2, 7)>
