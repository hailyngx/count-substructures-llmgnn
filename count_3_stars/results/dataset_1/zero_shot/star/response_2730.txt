Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be counted by finding all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list out the 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<0, (1, 7, 5)>
<0, (3, 0, 4)>
<0, (4, 1, 5)>
<0, (5, 1, 7)>
<0, (7, 1, 5)>
<1, (0, 2, 8)>
<1, (2, 1, 8)>
<1, (8, 2, 3)>
<2, (1, 5, 8)>
<3, (0, 8, 4)>
<4, (0, 8, 5)>
<5, (0, 2, 7)>
<5, (0, 7, 8)>
<5, (2, 1, 8)>
<7, (0, 5, 8)>
<8, (1, 3, 9)>
<8, (2, 1, 3)>
<8, (3, 0, 4)>
<8, (4, 0, 5)>
<8, (5, 0, 7)>
<8, (7, 1, 5)>
<8, (9, 8, 1)>
<9, (8, 1, 3)>

Counting these unique 3-stars gives us a total of [26].
