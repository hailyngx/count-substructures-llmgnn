Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The central nodes in a 3-star must have degree 3 (connected to exactly 3 other nodes). From the given graph, we can observe the following 3-stars:

<1, (3, 4, 6)>
<2, (4, 6, 8)>
<3, (1, 6, 7)>
<4, (1, 2, 9)>
<5, (7, 8, 9)>
<6, (3, 4, 9)>
<7, (3, 5, 9)>
<8, (2, 5, 9)>
<9, (4, 5, 6)>

There are a total of 9 unique 3-stars. So, the final count of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
