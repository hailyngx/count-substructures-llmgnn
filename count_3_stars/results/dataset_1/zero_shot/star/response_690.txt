Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (3, 9, 5)>
<2, (3, 5, 6)>
<3, (1, 2, 4)>
<4, (3, 4, 8)>
<5, (2, 5, 9)>
