Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 1) (6, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
The graph contains the following 3-stars:
[<1, (0, 3, 5)>, <3, (1, 2, 8)>] 

Therefore, there are a total of [2] 3-stars in the graph.
