Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 3, 8)>
<1, (0, 5, 9)>
<2, (3, 8, 9)>
<3, (0, 2, 7)>
<5, (1, 7, 9)>
<9, (1, 2, 5)>
