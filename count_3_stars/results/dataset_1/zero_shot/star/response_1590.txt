Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's count the number of 3-star subgraphs in this given graph:
- The central node has degree 3 since it is connected to nodes 3, 8, and 1. So, the central node options are {1, 3, 8}.
- For each central node:
  - Central node 1: (1, 3, 4) and (1, 7, 8) are two 3-stars.
  - Central node 3: (3, 0, 4) and (3, 1, 8) are two 3-stars.
  - Central node 8: (8, 0, 1) is one 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].  
The unique 3-stars are: <<1, (3, 4, 7)>, <1, (1, 3, 8)>, <3, (3, 0, 4)>, <3, (1, 3, 8)>, <8, (8, 0, 1)>>.
