Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [3] 3-stars in the given graph. 
The unique 3-stars are <0, (1, 6, 8)>, <3, (6, 7, 8)>, and <9, (0, 8, 3)>.
