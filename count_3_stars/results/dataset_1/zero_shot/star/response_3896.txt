Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in this graph. Here are the 3-stars along with their central nodes and leaf nodes:

[<1, (0, 2, 3)>, <2, (1, 5, 6)>, <2, (6, 7, 8)>, <2, (8, 9, 7)>, <3, (1, 6, 7)>, <6, (2, 3, 9)>]
