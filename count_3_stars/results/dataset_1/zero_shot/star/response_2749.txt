Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
	
The unique 3-stars found are <0, (4, 5, 8)>, <1, (3, 7, 9)>, <2, (4, 6, -)>, <4, (0, 2, 5)>, <5, (0, 4, -)>, <6, (2, 4, -)>, <7, (1, 3, -)>, <8, (0, -, -)>, <9, (1, 4, -)>.
