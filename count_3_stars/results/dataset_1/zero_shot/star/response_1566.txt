Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 6, 9)>
<1, (6, 8, 5)>
