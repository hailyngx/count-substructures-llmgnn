Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The 3-stars are:

<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<2, (1, 3, 6)>
<3, (0, 2, 9)>
<4, (0, 2, 5)>
<6, (2, 3, 7)>
<8, (0, 7, 9)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
