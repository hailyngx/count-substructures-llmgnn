Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].  

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:  
<3, (4, 6, 9)>  
<4, (1, 3, 7)>  
<6, (2, 3, 9)>  
<7, (0, 4, 9)>  
<8, (1, 3, 9)>  
<9, (3, 5, 6)>
