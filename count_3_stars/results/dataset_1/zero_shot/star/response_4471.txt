Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the answer is [4].
The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (8, 9, 0)>
<2, (4, 5, 7)>
<3, (1, 2, 7)>
<4, (2, 5, 8)>
