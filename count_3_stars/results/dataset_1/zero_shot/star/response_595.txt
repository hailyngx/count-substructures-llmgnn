Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 9) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].  
The unique 3-stars found are:  
<0, (1, 3, 5)>  
<1, (0, 4, 8)>
