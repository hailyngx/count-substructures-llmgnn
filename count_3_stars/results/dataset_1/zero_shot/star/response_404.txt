Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph. 

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<5, (8, 6, -)>
