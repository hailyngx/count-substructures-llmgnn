Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
The 3-stars are: 
<0, (2, 3, 8)>
<1, (4, 7, 9)>
<2, (0, 8, 3)>
<4, (1, 6, 7)>
<6, (4, 5, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
