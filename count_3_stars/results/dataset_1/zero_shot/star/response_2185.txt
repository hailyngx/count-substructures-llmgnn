Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [8] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 9, 2)>
<1, (5, 2, 9)>
<2, (4, 7, 5)>
<2, (4, 9, 7)>
<3, (6, 8, 5)>
<4, (0, 2, 9)>
<4, (7, 5, 9)>
<5, (1, 2, 6)>
