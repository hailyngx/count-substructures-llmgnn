Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are:
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<3, (0, 2, 5)>
<5, (3, 6, 8)>
<6, (1, 3, 5)>
<8, (2, 5, 7)>
