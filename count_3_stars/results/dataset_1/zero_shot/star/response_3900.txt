Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (5, 6, 7)>
<2, (4, 5, 7)>
<4, (2, 3, 8)>
<5, (0, 2, 6)>
<6, (0, 5, 8)>
<7, (0, 1, 3)>
