Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are: 
<0, (1, 2, 0)>
<1, (0, 4, 8)>
<2, (0, 7, 9)>
<3, (4, 5, 6)>
<4, (1, 3, 5)>
<5, (3, 4, 6)>
<6, (3, 5, 7)>
<7, (2, 6, 7)>
<8, (1, 8, None)>
<9, (2, 4, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
