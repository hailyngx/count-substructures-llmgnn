Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (3, 4, 5)>
<1, (4, 5, 8)>
<4, (1, 6, 7)>
<5, (0, 1, 8)>
