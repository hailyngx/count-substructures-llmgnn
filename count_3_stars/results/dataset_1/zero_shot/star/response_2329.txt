Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 4 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are inside brackets:

[4]

And here are the unique 3-stars:
<1, (0, 3, 6)>
<3, (1, 2, 6)>
<3, (1, 6, 8)>
<7, (3, 6, 9)>
