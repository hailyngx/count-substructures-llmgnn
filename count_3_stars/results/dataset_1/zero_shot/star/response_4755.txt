Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here is the list of all 3-stars found:

[<0, (5, 9)>, <3, (4, 6, 8)>, <4, (1, 3, 7)>, <5, (0, 6, 9)>, <6, (3, 5, 7)>]
