Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The graph is as follows:

```
    1 --- 5  
   /        \
  0    7    2
   \  /     |
    4 - 6   9
         \ /
          3
```

Therefore, the 3-star graphs in this graph are: 
<0, (3, 4, 6)>
<2, (5, 8, 9)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
