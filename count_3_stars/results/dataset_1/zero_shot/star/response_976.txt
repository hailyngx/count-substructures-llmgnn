Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are a total of [3] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 9, 3)>
<1, (6, 8, 5)>
<2, (0, 6, 7)>
