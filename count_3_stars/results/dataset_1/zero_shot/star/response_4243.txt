Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
There are [ ] 3-stars in this graph.

Unique 3-stars: 
<0, (2, 8, 6)>
<1, (3, 5, 7)>
<1, (5, 4, 9)>
