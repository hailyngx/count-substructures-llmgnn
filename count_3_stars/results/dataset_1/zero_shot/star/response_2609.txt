Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The count of 3-stars is [4].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 7, 9)>
<1, (4, 6, 2)>
<4, (1, 7, 8)>
<6, (1, 3, 5)>
