Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 8) (2, 9) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 3 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

The 3-stars are:
<0, (5, 7, 8)>
<5, (0, 6, 9)>
<7, (0, 4, 6)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
