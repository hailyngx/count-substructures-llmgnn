Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The count of 3-stars is [4].

<1, (0, 5, 7)>
<2, (5, 1, 6)>
<4, (1, 2, 6)>
<6, (1, 2, 4)>
