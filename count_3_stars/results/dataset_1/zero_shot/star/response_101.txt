Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
There are 3 unique 3-stars in this graph. The 3-stars are as follows:
<0, (4, 6, 9)>
<2, (1, 8, 9)>
<5, (3, 6, 7)>
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [3].
