Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There is a total of [2] unique 3-stars in the given graph.  


Here are the unique 3-stars found:  
<0, (3, 7, 4)>  
<9, (6, 2, 5)>
