Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph.  
The unique 3-stars are:  
<0, (4, 6, 7)>  
<2, (4, 6, 8)>  
<4, (0, 2, 6)>  
<6, (0, 4, 9)>  

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
