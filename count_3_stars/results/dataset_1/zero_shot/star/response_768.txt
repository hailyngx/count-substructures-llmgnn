Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 6 3-stars in the given graph. The unique 3-stars found are:

<0, (1, 6, 8)>
<2, (0, 3, 6)>
<4, (5, 6, 9)>
<5, (2, 4, 7)>
<6, (0, 2, 4)>
<8, (0, 1, 6)>

The final answer is [6].
