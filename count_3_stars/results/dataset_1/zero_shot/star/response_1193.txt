Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in this graph. 
The 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 6, 8)>
<1, (0, 8, 8)>
<2, (3, 5, 8)>
<4, (5, 6, 7)>
<5, (2, 4, 8)>
<8, (3, 5, 9)>

Therefore, the final answer is [6].
