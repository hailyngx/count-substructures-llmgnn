Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [11].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 4, 7)>
<1, (3, 6, 7)>
<2, (6, 7, 8)>
<3, (0, 1, 5)>
<4, (0, 7, 8)>
<5, (3, 5, 8)>
<6, (1, 2, 7)>
<7, (0, 4, 7)>
<8, (4, 5, 8)>
<9, (7, 8, 7)>
<10, (7, 7, 9)>
