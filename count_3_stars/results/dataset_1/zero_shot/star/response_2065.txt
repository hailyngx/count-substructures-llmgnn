Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [3] 3-stars in the given graph.  

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<1, (0, 3, 6)>
<5, (0, 6, 8)>
