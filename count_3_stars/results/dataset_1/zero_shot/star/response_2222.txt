Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
There is only one 3-star in the given graph.  
Therefore, the answer is [1].  

The unique 3-star found is:  
<8, (0, 2, 4)>
