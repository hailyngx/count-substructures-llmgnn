Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are a total of [12] 3-stars in the given graph. Here are the unique 3-stars found:

<0, (3, 6, 9)>
<2, (7, 8, 6)>
<3, (0, 6, 9)>
<4, (1, 6, 9)>
<5, (6, 8, 9)>
<6, (0, 4, 5)>
<7, (2, 6, 8)>
<8, (2, 5, 7)>
<9, (3, 5, 6)>
