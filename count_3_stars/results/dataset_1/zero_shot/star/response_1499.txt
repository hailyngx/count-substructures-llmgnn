Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be found by examining each node and counting how many 3-stars it is a part of. A 3-star consists of a center node and 3 leaf nodes. 

Here are the 3-stars in the given graph along with the center node and leaf nodes:
<0, (4, 7, 9)>
<1, (7, 8, 9)>
<2, (3, 4, 7)>
<3, (2, 5, 6)>
<4, (0, 2, 5)>
<5, (3, 4, -)>
<6, (3, 8, 9)>
<7, (0, 1, 2)>
<8, (1, 6, -)>
<9, (1, 3, 4)>

Therefore, there are 9 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The final answer is [9].
