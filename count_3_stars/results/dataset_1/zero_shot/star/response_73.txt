Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 8 unique 3-stars in this graph:
<0, (7, 8, 9)>
<1, (2, 4, 7)>
<2, (1, 4, 9)>
<3, (5, 8, 9)>
<4, (2, 9, -)>
<5, (3, 9, -)>
<6, (8, -, -)>
<7, (0, 1, 8)>

Therefore, there are a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
