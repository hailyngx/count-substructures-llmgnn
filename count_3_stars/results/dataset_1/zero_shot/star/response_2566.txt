Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 7) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 3 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are listed uniquely:

<0, (8, 7, 1)>
<1, (7, 8, 0)>
<4, (5, 3, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
