Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the graph can be calculated by counting the number of occurrences of each node as the center node in the 3-star. Let's go ahead and do this:

1. Node 0: (0, 3, 4), (0, 4, 7), (0, 5, 1), (0, 6, 7)
2. Node 1: (1, 2, 5), (1, 5, 0), (1, 9, 2)
3. Node 2: (2, 1, 5), (2, 3, 0), (2, 5, 1), (2, 7, 0), (2, 9, 1)
4. Node 3: (3, 0, 2)
5. Node 4: (4, 0, 7), (4, 7, 2), (4, 8, 9)
6. Node 5: (5, 0, 1), (5, 1, 2), (5, 2, 7)
7. Node 6: (6, 0, 7), (6, 7, 4), (6, 9, 1)
8. Node 7: (7, 0, 4), (7, 2, 0), (7, 4, 6), (7, 6, 0)
9. Node 8: (8, 4, 9)
10. Node 9: (9, 1, 2), (9, 2, 4), (9, 4, 8), (9, 6, 0)

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the graph are:
<0, (3, 4, 7)>, <0, (5, 1, 6)>, <1, (2, 5, 9)>, <4, (7, 8, 9)>, <5, (1, 2, 7)>, <6, (0, 4, 7)>, and <9, (2, 4, 8)>.

Counting them all, we get a total of [7].
