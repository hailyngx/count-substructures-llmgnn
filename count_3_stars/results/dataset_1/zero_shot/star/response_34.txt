Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The 3-stars are:
<1, (3, 6, 7)>
<2, (6, 8, 9)>
<3, (1, 5, 6)>
<6, (1, 2, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
