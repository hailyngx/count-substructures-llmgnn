Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].  

The 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 6, 0)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<2, (4, 6, 8)>
<3, (1, 4, 5)>
<4, (1, 2, 8)>
<7, (6, 8, 9)>
