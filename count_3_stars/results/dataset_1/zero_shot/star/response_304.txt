Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are [2] 3-stars in the given graph.  

The unique 3-stars are:  
<1, (2, 3, 4)>  
<3, (1, 5, 8)>
