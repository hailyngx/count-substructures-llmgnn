Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph:
<0, (8, 2, 3)>
<9, (3, 4, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
