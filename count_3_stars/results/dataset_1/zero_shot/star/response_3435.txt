Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<2, (3, 4, 5)>
<4, (2, 5, 8)>
<6, (1, 5, 7)>
<8, (0, 4, 6)>
