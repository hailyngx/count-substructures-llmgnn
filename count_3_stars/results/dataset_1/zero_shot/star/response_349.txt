Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 4) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (8, 3, 8)>
<1, (5, 4, 6)>
<2, (4, 5, 6)>
<3, (8, 8, 6)>
<4, (2, 5, 6)>
<6, (1, 4, 5)>
