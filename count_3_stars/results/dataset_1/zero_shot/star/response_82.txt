Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph: 

<0, (4, 5, 3)>
<2, (5, 3, 9)>
<3, (5, 9, 4)>
<6, (7, 9, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
