Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (7, 9, 0)>
<2, (4, 5, 9)>
<3, (4, 6, 7)>
<7, (0, 4, 5)>
