Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be obtained by counting the number of instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's do this step by step.

1. Looking at the edge list, we see that nodes 0 and 6 have 4 connections each, violating the definition of a 3-star. So, we can exclude nodes 0 and 6 as potential centers.

2. Now, let's check the remaining nodes:
   - Node 1: Connected to node 9 only.
   - Node 2: Connected to nodes 4, 6, 7, and 8. (4 connections)
   - Node 3: Connected to nodes 0, 8, and 9. (3 connections)
   - Node 4: Connected to nodes 2, 5, 6, and 9. (4 connections)
   - Node 5: Connected to nodes 0, 4, 6, and 8. (4 connections)
   - Node 7: Connected to nodes 2 and 8 only.
   - Node 9: Connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, 6, and 8. (5 connections)
   
3. From the remaining nodes, we find that nodes 3 and 7 are the only nodes satisfying the criteria of being connected to exactly three other nodes.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is simply the count of unique 3-stars with nodes 3 or 7 as the center and their connected leaves.

The 3-stars in the given graph are:
- <3, (0, 8, 9)>
- <3, (8, 4, 9)>
- <3, (9, 1, 4)>
- <7, (2, 8, 9)>
- <7, (8, 2, 5)>

Counting these unique 3-stars, we get a total of [5] 3-stars in the graph.
