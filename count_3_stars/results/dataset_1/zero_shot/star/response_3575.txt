Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 3 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The count of 3-stars is [3].
The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 8, 9)>
<2, (3, 7, 9)>
<5, (1, 6, 7)>
