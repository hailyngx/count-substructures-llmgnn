Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 5) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (6, 8, 5)>
<1, (2, 6, 5)>
<2, (1, 3, 6)>
<3, (2, 5, 6)>
<5, (3, 6, 8)>
<8, (0, 5, 7)>
