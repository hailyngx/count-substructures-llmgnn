Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 5, 8)>
<0, (5, 8, 9)>
<1, (4, 7, 6)>
<7, (1, 8, 9)>
