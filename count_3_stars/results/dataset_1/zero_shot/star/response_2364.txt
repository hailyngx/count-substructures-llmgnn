Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 44 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6]:

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (5, 6, 7)>
<1, (2, 3, 4)>
<1, (3, 4, 9)>
<1, (4, 5, 7)>
<1, (7, 8, 9)>
<4, (1, 5, 9)>
