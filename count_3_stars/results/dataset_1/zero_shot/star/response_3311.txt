Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The 3-stars in this graph are as follows: 
<0, (1, 2, 6)>
<0, (1, 8, 9)>
<0, (2, 5, 8)>
<0, (6, 8, 9)>
<0, (8, 9, 6)>
<1, (0, 2, 8)>
<1, (2, 3, 5)>
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<2, (0, 3, 5)>
<2, (1, 3, 5)>
<2, (3, 1, 5)>
<2, (5, 1, 3)>
<8, (0, 1, 5)>
<8, (0, 5, 9)>
<8, (1, 0, 5)>
<8, (5, 0, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 8)>
<9, (0, 6, 8)>
<9, (0, 8, 6)>
<9, (1, 0, 8)>
