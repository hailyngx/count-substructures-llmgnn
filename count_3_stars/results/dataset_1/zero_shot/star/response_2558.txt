Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (6, 7, 8)>
<3, (1, 2, 5)>
<4, (1, 5, 6)>
<7, (0, 1, 3)>
