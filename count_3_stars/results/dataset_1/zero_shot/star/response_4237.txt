Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 6) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 2) (9, 2) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<2, (0, 8, 9)>
<4, (0, 6, 6)>
<6, (0, 4, 7)>
