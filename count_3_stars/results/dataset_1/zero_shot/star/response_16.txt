Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The count of 3-stars is 4. Please find them below:

[<0, (2, 8, 9)>, <2, (0, 5, 8)>, <4, (5, 7, 9)>, <8, (0, 7, 9)>]
