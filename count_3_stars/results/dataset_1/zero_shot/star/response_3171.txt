Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are as follows:

[<0, (3, 5, 7)>, <2, (1, 5, 9)>, <5, (0, 2, 7)>, <7, (0, 5, 9)>, <9, (1, 2, 7)>]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
