Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 5, 9)>
<1, (6, 7, 9)>
<2, (0, 7, 9)>
<3, (4, 5, 9)>
<4, (3, 7, 9)>
<6, (1, 3, 7)>
