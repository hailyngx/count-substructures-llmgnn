Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The 3-stars are:

<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<1, (0, 2, 6)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
