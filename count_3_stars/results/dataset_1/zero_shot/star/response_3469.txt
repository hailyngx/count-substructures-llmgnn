Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<0, (4, 6, 9)>
<0, (5, 6, 9)>
<1, (3, 5, 9)>
<4, (6, 7, 9)>
