Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 6, 8)>
<2, (0, 1, 4)>
<6, (0, 1, 9)>
<9, (3, 6, 7)>
