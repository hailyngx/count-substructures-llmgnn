Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are a total of [3] 3-stars in the given graph. Here are the unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 7, 7)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<6, (1, 3, 9)>
