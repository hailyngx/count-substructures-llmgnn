Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are <0, (4, 6, 9)>, <1, (4, 5, 6)> 3-stars present in the given graph. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
