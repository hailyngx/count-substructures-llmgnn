Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The graph contains the following 3-stars: <1, (2, 4, 6)>, <1, (8, 9, 7)>.
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
