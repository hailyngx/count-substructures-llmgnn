Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are:

<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<1, (0, 4, 5)>
<4, (0, 1, 6)>
<4, (0, 6, 8)>
<5, (0, 1, 7)>
<8, (0, 1, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
