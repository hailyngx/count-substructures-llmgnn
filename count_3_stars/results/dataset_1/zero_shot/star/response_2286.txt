Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be determined by identifying each node that serves as the center of a 3-star and then counting the occurrences. Let's find the 3-stars first.

The 3-stars in the given graph are:
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<1, (4, 7, 9)>
<2, (6, 7, 8)>
<3, (0, 5, 6)>
<4, (0, 1, 6)>
<7, (1, 2, 6)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we have found six in total. Thus, the final answer is [6].
