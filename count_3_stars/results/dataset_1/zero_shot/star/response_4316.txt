Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph contains the following 3-stars:
- <0, (2, 7, 0)>
- <2, (0, 3, 5)>
- <3, (2, 9, 9)>
- <4, (5, 8, 9)>
- <5, (2, 4, 5)>
- <9, (3, 4, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
