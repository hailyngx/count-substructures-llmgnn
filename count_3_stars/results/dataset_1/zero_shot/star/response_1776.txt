Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. To count the number of 3-stars (subgraphs with a center node connected to exactly three other nodes), we can identify all such unique 3-stars in the graph.

Let's list the 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<1, (2, 3, 4)>
<2, (1, 5, 6)>
<3, (0, 1, 5)>
<4, (1, 9, 3)>
<5, (0, 2, 3)>
<6, (0, 2, 9)>
<7, (1, 3, 9)>
<8, (2, 1, 6)>
<9, (4, 6, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
