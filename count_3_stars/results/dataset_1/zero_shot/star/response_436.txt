Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph can be found by analyzing the edges provided. 

There are multiple 3-stars in this graph. Let's list them and count the total number of unique 3-stars:

1. <0, (2, 4, 7)>
2. <2, (0, 7, 4)>
3. <4, (0, 7, 8)>
4. <7, (0, 2, 4)>
5. <6, (4, 8, 9)>
6. <8, (4, 6, 7)>
7. <9, (3, 6, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
