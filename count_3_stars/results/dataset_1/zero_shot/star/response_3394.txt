Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph. 
These 3-stars are: <0, (2, 1, 9)>, <1, (2, 4, 7)>, <1, (4, 7, 9)>, <3, (6, 9, 7)>, <4, (1, 7, 9)>, <6, (3, 7, 9)>.
