Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) 

Response:
There are a total of [3] 3-stars in the given graph. The unique 3-stars are <0, (5, 6, 4)>, <1, (4, 2, 8)>, and <2, (3, 4, 7)>.
