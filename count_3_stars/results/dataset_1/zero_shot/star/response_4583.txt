Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 9) (6, 2) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The total number of nodes is 10. Since each 3-star consists of a center node and three leaves, we need to check each node one by one to see if it is a center of a 3-star.

Starting with node 0:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, and 7. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 6, 8, and 9, but it is not connected back to node 0 (as it needs to form a 3-star). Therefore, node 0 does not form a 3-star.

Moving on to node 1:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3 and 8. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 9, but it is not connected back to node 1 (as it needs to form a 3-star). Therefore, node 1 does not form a 3-star.

Skipping node 2 as it was already checked.

Moving on to node 3:
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 9. Node 0 is already checked, node 1 is not connected back to node 3, and node 9 is not connected back to node 3. Therefore, node 3 does not form a 3-star.

Moving on to node 4:
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0 and 9. Node 0 is already checked. Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 4, but it is not connected back to node 4. Therefore, node 4 does not form a 3-star.

Skipping nodes 5, 6, and 7 as they have no connections.

Moving on to node 8:
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1 and 2. Node 1 is already checked, and node 2 is not connected back to node 8. Therefore, node 8 does not form a 3-star.

Moving on to node 9:
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 4. Node 2 and 3 are already checked, and node 4 is not connected back to node 9. Therefore, node 9 does not form a 3-star.

After checking all nodes, we find that there are no 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is: [0]
