Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (2, 4, 7)>
<3, (6, 7, 9)>
<4, (1, 6, 7)>
<6, (3, 4, 8)>
<7, (1, 2, 9)>
<9, (3, 5, 7)>
