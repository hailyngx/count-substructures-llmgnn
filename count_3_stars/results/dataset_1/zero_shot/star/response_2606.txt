Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) 

Response:
There are [3] 3-star structures in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 7, 9)>
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<4, (2, 3, 5)>
