Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 4 different 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (3, 6, 7)>
<1, (6, 7, 8)>
<4, (5, 9, 6)>
<6, (1, 5, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
