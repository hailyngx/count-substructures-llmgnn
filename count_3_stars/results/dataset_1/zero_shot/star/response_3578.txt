Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (8, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are two 3-stars in the given graph. The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 6, 8)>
<4, (1, 2, 3)>
So the final answer is [2].
