Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 3-stars in this graph.  
The unique 3-stars are:  
<0, (4, 6, 7)>  
<1, (3, 5, 8)>  
<2, (3, 7, 9)>  
<9, (1, 2, 8)>  

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
