Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 3 unique 3-star configurations in the given graph. The count of 3-stars is [3].

<1, (2, 3, 5)>
<4, (3, 5, 7)>
<9, (5, 6, 4)>
