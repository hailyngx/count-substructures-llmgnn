Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The given graph has 6 3-star structures.

[6]

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 7, 8)>
<1, (5, 6, 9)>
<2, (0, 5, 7)>
<3, (6, 8, 9)>
<5, (1, 2, 6)>
<6, (1, 3, 5)>
