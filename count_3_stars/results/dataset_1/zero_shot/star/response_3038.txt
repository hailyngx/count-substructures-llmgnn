Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) 

Response:
The center nodes to consider for 3-stars are 2, 5, 7, and 8 since they each have 3 connections to other nodes.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each potential center:
- For node 2: There are three possible 3-stars: <2, (0, 1, 3)>, <2, (5, 8, 3)>, <2, (0, 1, 5)>.
- For node 5: There are no valid 3-stars for node 5 as it either has less or more than 3 connections.
- For node 7: There are no valid 3-stars for node 7 as it either has less or more than 3 connections.
- For node 8: There are no valid 3-stars for node 8 as it either has less or more than 3 connections.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3]. The unique 3-stars found are <2, (0, 1, 3)>, <2, (5, 8, 3)>, and <2, (0, 1, 5)>.
