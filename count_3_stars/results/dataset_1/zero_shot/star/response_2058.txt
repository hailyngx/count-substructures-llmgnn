Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
The total number of 3-star graphs in the given graph can be found by counting the number of occurrences of subgraphs where one node has exactly three adjacent nodes. In this case, we are looking for subgraphs where one node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Calculating the 3-star graphs in the given graph:
- Node 1 has 4 adjacent nodes (2, 3, 6, 8)
- Node 2 has 4 adjacent nodes (1, 3, 4, 6)
- Node 6 has 4 adjacent nodes (1, 2, 4, 9)
- Node 3 has 4 adjacent nodes (0, 1, 2, 8)

Therefore, there are 4 possible 3-star graphs in the given graph.

The unique 3-star graphs are:
- <1, (2, 3, 6)>
- <2, (1, 3, 6)>
- <6, (1, 2, 4)>
- <3, (0, 1, 2)>

So, the final answer is [4].
