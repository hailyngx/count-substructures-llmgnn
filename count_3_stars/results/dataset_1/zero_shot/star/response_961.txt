Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph.
The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<1, (2, 4, 7)>
<2, (0, 1, 5)>
<7, (1, 4, 6)>

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
