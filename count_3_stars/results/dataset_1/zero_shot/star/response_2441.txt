Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be calculated by counting the number of sets of 3 nodes that are connected to a common central node. 

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (4, 9), (9)>  
<1, (3, 5, 8), (5)>  
<2, (3, 8, 9), (8)>  
<3, (1, 2, 8), (2)>  
<4, (0, 9, 5), (9)>  
<5, (1, 6, 9), (6)>  
<6, (5, 7, 9), (7)>  
<7, (6, 8, 9), (8)>  
<8, (1, 2, 3), (2)>  
<9, (0, 4, 5), (4)>  

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
