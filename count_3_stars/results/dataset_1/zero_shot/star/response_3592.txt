Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph has 3 stars can be found by examining each node in the graph to see if it is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

1. <0, (2, 1, 9)>
2. <1, (2, 4, 8)>
3. <2, (0, 1, 7)>
4. <4, (1, 6, 8)>
5. <5, (7, 8, 9)>
6. <6, (4, 9, 7)>
7. <7, (2, 5, 8)>
8. <8, (1, 4, 5)>
9. <9, (1, 6, 5)>

Therefore, there are 9 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The final answer is [9].
