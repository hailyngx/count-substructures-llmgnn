Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<2, (1, 5, 8)>
