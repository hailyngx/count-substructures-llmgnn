Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be calculated using the information provided. The key observation here is that each 3-star has a center node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Based on the edges provided, we can identify the 3-stars as follows:

<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<1, (2, 4, 7)>
<2, (1, 4, 8)>
<3, (0, 6, 8)>
<4, (0, 1, 2), (6, 7, 8)>
<5, (0, 8)>
<6, (3, 4, 7)>
<7, (1, 2, 4, 6, 8)>
<8, (0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7)>
<9, (1)>

Thus, there are a total of [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
