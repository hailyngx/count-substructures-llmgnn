Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The graph has the following 3-stars:
[<0, (1, 7, 9)>, <1, (0, 8, 9)>, <2, (0, 5, -)>, <4, (3, 7, 9)>, <5, (2, 9, -)>, <7, (0, 4, 6)>, <8, (1, 6, 7)>, <9, (0, 1, 4)>]

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
