Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are three 3-stars in the given graph. The unique 3-stars are as follows:
<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<1, (0, 2, 5)>
<2, (1, 6, 9)>
  
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
