Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

The 3-stars are:
<6, (0, 2, 9)>
<3, (2, 5, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
