Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
The central nodes of the 3-star graphs in this graph can be determined by identifying nodes with exactly 3 incident edges. Let's find the central nodes first:

Central nodes (with 3 incident edges): 0, 3

Now, we can list out the 3-stars present in the given graph:

<0, (2, 8, 1)>
<3, (8, 1, 4)>
<3, (8, 1, 5)>
<3, (8, 1, 7)>
<3, (8, 5, 1)>
<3, (8, 5, 7)>
<3, (1, 4, 9)>
<3, (1, 5, 2)>
<3, (1, 5, 7)>
<3, (1, 7, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
