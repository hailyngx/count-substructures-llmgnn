Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [4].
   
<0, (3, 4, 6)>
<3, (0, 2, 8)>
<3, (0, 4, 9)>
<4, (8, 3, 9)>
