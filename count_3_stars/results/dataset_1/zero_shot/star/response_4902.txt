Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph contains the following 3-stars:

[<0, (3, 4, 5)>, <1, (2, 6, 7)>, <2, (1, 6, 8)>, <3, (0, 4, 7)>, <4, (0, 3, 5)>, <5, (0, 7, 8)>, <6, (1, 2, 7)>, <7, (1, 3, 5)>, <8, (0, 2, 5)>, <9, (5, 6, 8)>]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
