Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph.  

Unique 3-stars: 
<0, (1, 4, 7)>
<1, (0, 8, 9)>
<2, (0, 6, 8)>
<4, (0, 3, 5)>
