Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) 

Response:
There are 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (6, 7, 8)>
<1, (5, 8, 4)>
<2, (3, 4, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
