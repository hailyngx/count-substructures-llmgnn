Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are 5 unique 3-stars in this graph. The count should be enclosed in brackets []. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 6, 1)>
<1, (2, 4, 5)>
<3, (0, 2, 4)>
<4, (1, 3, 6)>
<6, (0, 1, 3)>

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
