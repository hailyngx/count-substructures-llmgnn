Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2]. Here are the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (2, 3, 7)>
<9, (1, 5, 9)>
