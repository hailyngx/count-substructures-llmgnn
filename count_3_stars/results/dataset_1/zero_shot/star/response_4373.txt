Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<2, (1, 3, 8)>
<4, (0, 2, 9)>
<8, (0, 1, 6)>
