Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
The graph contains the following 3-stars:
[<0, (1, 8, 3)>, <2, (4, 5, 8)>, <3, (1, 4, 7)>, <4, (2, 3, 6)>, <5, (2, 6, 8)>, <6, (4, 5, 8)>, <7, (1, 3, 4)>, <8, (0, 1, 2)>]

There are a total of 8 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the final answer is [8].
