Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].  
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 4, 8)>
<1, (0, 3, 7)>
<2, (3, 4, 5)>
<4, (0, 2, 8)>
