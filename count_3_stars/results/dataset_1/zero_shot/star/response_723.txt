Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:

- <0, (1, 5, 8)>
- <0, (1, 5, 9)>

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
