Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
Since the graph consists of 10 nodes and 30 edges, we can start by identifying the 3-stars.

First, we need to find nodes with exactly 3 edges connected to them. Those nodes will be the centers of our 3-stars. After identifying such nodes, we can then find the remaining nodes connected to each center node to form the 3-stars.

Let's start finding the 3-stars:
1. Node 0 has 5 edges: (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 7), (0, 8), (0, 9) -> Forms a 3-star <0, (3, 4, 7)> and <0, (3, 8, 9)>
2. Node 2 has 3 edges: (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 8) -> Forms a 3-star <2, (5, 6, 8)>

Counting the number of 3-stars we found:
Number of 3-stars = 2

Therefore, the final answer is [2].
