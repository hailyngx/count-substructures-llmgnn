Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 8, 9)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<4, (3, 6, 7)>
<6, (2, 4, 5)>
<7, (4, 9, 0)>
<8, (0, 9, 3)>
<9, (4, 5, 6)>
