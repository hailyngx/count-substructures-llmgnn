Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 0) (4, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
The 10 nodes and 22 edges represent the following graph:

0 --- 1 --- 9  
|     |  
3     7 --- 5  
|    /|  
4   0 6  
|     |  
      8  
      |  
      5  

To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we can identify the central nodes and their corresponding leaves. 

The central nodes are: 0, 1, 6, 7  
The 3-stars in this graph are:  
<0, (1, 3, 4)>  
<1, (0, 7, 9)>  
<7, (0, 1, 5)>  
<6, (0, 2, 9)>  
<6, (2, 0, 9)>  
<7, (1, 0, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
