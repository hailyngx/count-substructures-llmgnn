Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The center node and leaves of each 3-star in the given graph are as follows:
<0, (3, 5, 1)>
<1, (3, 9, 2)>
<2, (4, 8, 9)>
<3, (0, 1, 4)>
<4, (2, 7, 8)>
<5, (0, 2, 6)>
<6, (5, 7, -)>
<7, (4, 5, 6)>
<8, (2, 4, -)>
<9, (1, 2, 5)>

Therefore, there are [9] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
