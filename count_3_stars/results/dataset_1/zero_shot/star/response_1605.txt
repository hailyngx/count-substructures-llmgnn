Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (0, 2, 6)>
<2, (1, 8, 9)>
<5, (4, 7, 8)>
<8, (2, 5, 7)>
