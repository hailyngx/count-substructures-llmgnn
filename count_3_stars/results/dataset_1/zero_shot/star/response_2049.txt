Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
We need to identify the 3-stars in the given graph. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Here are the 3-stars present in the given graph:

There are 2 different 3-stars in the graph, and the count is [2].
The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 4, 9)>
<2, (1, 5, 6)>
