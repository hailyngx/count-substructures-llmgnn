Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated by counting the occurrences of each node as the center node and determining how many possible combinations of three leaf nodes each 3-star can have. 

So let's calculate it step by step:
1. Node 0 can form 1 3-star.
2. Node 1 can form 3 3-stars <1, (2, 3, 5)>, <1, (2, 4, 7)>, <1, (3, 5, 9)>.
3. Node 2 can form 3 3-stars <2, (0, 1, 7)>, <2, (1, 7, 9)>, <2, (0, 7, 9)>.
4. Node 3 can form 3 3-stars <3, (1, 4, 9)>, <3, (2, 4, 9)>, <3, (4, 9, 5)>.
5. Node 4 can form 1 3-star.
6. Node 5 can form 3 3-stars <5, (1, 7, 9)>, <5, (1, 3, 9)>, <5, (3, 7, 9)>.
7. Node 6 can form 1 3-star.
8. Node 7 can form 1 3-star.
9. Node 9 can form 3 3-stars <9, (2, 3, 5)>, <9, (2, 3, 7)>, <9, (3, 5, 7)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [19] and the unique 3-stars are: 
<1, (2, 3, 5)>, 
<1, (2, 4, 7)>, 
<1, (3, 5, 9)>,
<2, (0, 1, 7)>, 
<2, (1, 7, 9)>, 
<2, (0, 7, 9)>, 
<3, (1, 4, 9)>, 
<3, (2, 4, 9)>, 
<3, (4, 9, 5)>, 
<5, (1, 7, 9)>, 
<5, (1, 3, 9)>, 
<5, (3, 7, 9)>, 
<9, (2, 3, 5)>, 
<9, (2, 3, 7)>, 
<9, (3, 5, 7)>.
