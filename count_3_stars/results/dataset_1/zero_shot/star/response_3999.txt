Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:
- Node 1 is connected to Node 4.
- Node 4 is connected to Nodes 1, 8, and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to Nodes 7 and 8.
- Node 7 is connected to Nodes 6 and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to Nodes 4, 6, 7, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to Nodes 4 and 8.

To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify all unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify these cases:

1. <4, (1, 8, 9)>
2. <8, (4, 6, 9)>
3. <6, (7, 8, -)>
4. <7, (6, 8, -)>

There are a total of 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the final answer is [4].
