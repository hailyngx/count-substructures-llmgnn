Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [3] 3-stars in the given graph. 
These 3-stars are: 
<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<2, (1, 4, 8)>
<9, (1, 2, 8)>
