Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 5) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are four 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are represented as unique 3-stars:

<2, (0, 5, 9)>
<3, (1, 4, 6)>
<4, (3, 9, 8)>
<5, (2, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
