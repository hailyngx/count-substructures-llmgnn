Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-star structures:
[<2, (0, 3, 9)>, <3, (2, 4, 9)>, <4, (3, 5, 8)>, <5, (4, 8, 9)>]

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
