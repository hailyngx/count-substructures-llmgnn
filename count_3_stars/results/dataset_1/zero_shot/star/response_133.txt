Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 8 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
The 3-stars are: 
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<3, (1, 6, 9)>
<4, (0, 1, 9)>
<5, (0, 1, 9)>
<6, (2, 3, 8)>
<7, (0, 8, 9)>
<8, (6, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
