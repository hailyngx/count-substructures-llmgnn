Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The center of the 3-stars must have degree 3 in order to form a 3-star. Since there are only 10 nodes, it's quite straightforward to identify the 3-stars in this graph by finding the nodes with degree 3 and their neighbors. 

The nodes with degree 3 are: 0, 4, and 8. 

Let's identify the 3-stars:
1. <0, (2, 4, 9)>
2. <4, (0, 8, 9)>
3. <8, (1, 4, 9)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
