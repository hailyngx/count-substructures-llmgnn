Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 9 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
The 3-star configurations are:
<0, (2, 5, 7)>
<1, (3, 6, 7)>
<2, (0, 3, 4)>
<3, (1, 2, 4)>
<3, (5, 7, 9)>
<4, (2, 3, 7)>
<5, (0, 3, 7)>
<6, (1, 8, 9)>
<9, (6, 7, 5)>

The final count of 3-stars is [9].
