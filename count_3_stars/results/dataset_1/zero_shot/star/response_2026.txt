Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The 3-stars are:

<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<2, (0, 5, 8)>
<3, (1, 6, 8)>
<4, (0, 6, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
