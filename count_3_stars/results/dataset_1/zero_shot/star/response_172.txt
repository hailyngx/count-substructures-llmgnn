Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

The 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 5, 5)>
<5, (0, 1, 2)>
<5, (1, 2, 7)>
<7, (2, 5, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
