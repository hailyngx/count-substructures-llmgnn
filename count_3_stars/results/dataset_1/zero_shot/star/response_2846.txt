Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 9) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph. 

<0, (3, 4, 7)>
<3, (0, 1, 4)>
<4, (0, 2, 3)>
<8, (1, 2, 8)>
