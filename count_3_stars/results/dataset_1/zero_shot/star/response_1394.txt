Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be counted by identifying the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's first list the nodes that have exactly three connections:

- Node 1: (0, 4, 5, 6, 7)
- Node 4: (1, 2, 5, 6, 8)
- Node 5: (1, 4, 7)
- Node 6: (1, 4, 8)
- Node 7: (0, 1, 5, 9)
- Node 8: (3, 4, 6, 9)
- Node 9: (7, 8)

From the above list, we can see that the nodes 1, 4, 5, 6, and 7 are connected to exactly three other nodes, forming 3-star structures. We can represent these 3-stars as follows:

- <1, (0, 7, 5)>
- <4, (1, 2, 5)>
- <5, (1, 4, 7)>
- <6, (1, 8, 4)>
- <7, (0, 1, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
