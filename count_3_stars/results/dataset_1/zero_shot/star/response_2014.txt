Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3 and 4.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 5 and 6.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 7, and 8.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 6, and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 6.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 7.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 4.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2 and 5.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 2 and 3.

To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all the 3-stars based on the definition provided. Each 3-star has a center node connected to exactly three leaf nodes.

The 3-stars in the graph are as follows:
- <0, (3, 4, 6)>
- <2, (4, 5, 7)>
- <2, (4, 5, 8)>
- <2, (5, 7, 8)>
- <3, (0, 6, 8)>
- <5, (1, 2, 7)>

Counting all the unique 3-stars, we get a total of [6].
