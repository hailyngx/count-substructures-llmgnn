Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The 3-stars are:

<0, (1, 6, 8)>
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<4, (1, 3, 5)>
<7, (1, 2, 4)>

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
