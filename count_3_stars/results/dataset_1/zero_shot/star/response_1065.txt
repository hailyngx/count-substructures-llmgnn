Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph. 
The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (3, 6, 8)>
<3, (1, 2, 8)>
<7, (3, 4, 8)>
<8, (0, 1, 3)>
