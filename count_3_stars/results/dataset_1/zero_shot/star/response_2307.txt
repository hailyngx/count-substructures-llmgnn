Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
The given graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

1. <0, (2, 3, 4)>
2. <1, (2, 6, 8)>
3. <2, (0, 1, 3)>
4. <3, (0, 2, 8)>
5. <4, (0, 2, 5)>
6. <5, (4, 8, 9)>

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
