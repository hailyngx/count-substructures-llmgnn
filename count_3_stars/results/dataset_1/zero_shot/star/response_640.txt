Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 6 3-stars in the given graph. Here is the list of unique 3-stars:
    
    <0, (1, 2, 7)>
    <1, (0, 7, 9)>
    <2, (0, 8, 6)>
    <3, (4, 7, 5)>
    <4, (3, 7, 5)>
    <6, (5, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the final answer is [6].
