Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
The given graph contains 3-stars:

[<0, (9, 2, 4)>, <1, (5, 8, 6)>]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
