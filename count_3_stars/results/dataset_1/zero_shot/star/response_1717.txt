Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are a total of [7] 3-star subgraphs in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (5, 1, 9)>
<1, (5, 0, 9)>
<2, (3, 6, 7)>
<3, (2, 4, 9)>
<4, (3, 8, 9)>
<5, (0, 1, 9)>
<9, (1, 3, 5)>
