Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<2, (0, 3, 8)>
<3, (2, 6, 8)>
<4, (0, 1, 6)>
<6, (0, 3, 4)>
<8, (2, 5, 6)>
