Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are <0, (2, 3, 7)> and <3, (0, 5, 7)>.
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
