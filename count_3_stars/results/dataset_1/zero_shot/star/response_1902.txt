Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The graph has the following 3-stars:
[<0, (8, 6, 9)>, <1, (3, 5, 7)>, <2, (4, 5, 7)>, <4, (2, 7, 9)>, <6, (8, 9, 6)>]
