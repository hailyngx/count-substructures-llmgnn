Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) 

Response:
There are 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (3, 6, 8)>
2. <3, (0, 1, 8)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
