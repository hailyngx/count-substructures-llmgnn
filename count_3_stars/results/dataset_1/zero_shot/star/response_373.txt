Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 5) 

Response:
The answer is [3].

The unique 3-stars found in the given graph are:
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<1, (0, 2, 7)>
<3, (2, 5, 6)>
