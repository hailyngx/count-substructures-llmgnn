Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are:

[
<0, (1, 4, 8)>,
<1, (0, 4, 7)>,
<2, (5, 6, 8)>,
<3, (4, 5, 7)>,
<4, (0, 1, 3)>,
<5, (2, 3, 9)>,
<6, (2, 4, 9)>,
<7, (1, 3, 9)>,
<8, (0, 2, 9)>,
<9, (2, 5, 7)>
]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
