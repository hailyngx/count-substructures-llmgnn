Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (2, 6) (3, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph.  
The unique 3-stars are:  
<0, (1, 5, 6)>  
<6, (2, 5, 8)>  
<7, (3, 8, 9)>  
<1, (0, 5, 6)>  
<3, (7, 8, 9)>  
<8, (6, 7, 9)>
