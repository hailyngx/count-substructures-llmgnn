Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph contains the following 4 unique 3-stars:

<0, (7, 1, 2)>
<1, (4, 6, 7)>
<2, (3, 6, 7)>
<6, (1, 2, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
