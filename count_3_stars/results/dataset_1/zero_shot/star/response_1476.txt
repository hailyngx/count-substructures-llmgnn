Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].

<0, (4, 7, 9)>
<1, (4, 7, 0)>
<2, (7, 0, 4)>
<4, (0, 1, 7)>
<4, (1, 7, 0)>
<4, (6, 7, 8)>
<4, (7, 0, 1)>
