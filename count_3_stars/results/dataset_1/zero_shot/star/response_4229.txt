Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
The number of 3-stars: [4]
Unique 3-stars: <0, (1, 3, 7)>, <1, (0, 2, 4)>, <3, (0, 5, 8)>, <7, (0, 4, 8)>
