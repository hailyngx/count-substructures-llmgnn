Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:
    - <0, (1, 5, 9)>
    - <1, (0, 2, 6)>
    - <5, (0, 3, 7)>
    - <7, (1, 5, 6)>
  
Therefore, there are a total of [4] 3-stars in this graph.
