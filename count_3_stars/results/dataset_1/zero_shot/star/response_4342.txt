Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are listed below:

<0, (6, 2, 5)>
<1, (5, 2, 9)>
<2, (4, 6, 5)>
<4, (2, 7, 5)>
<5, (1, 2, 6)>
<9, (1, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
