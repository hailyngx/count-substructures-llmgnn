Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
The 3-star patterns are:
<0, (2, 5, 8)>
<2, (0, 1, 4)>
<4, (2, 3, 6)>
<8, (0, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
