Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
Here are the unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 5, 9)>
<1, (0, 4, 5)>
<2, (4, 9, -)>
<3, (6, 9, -)>
<4, (1, 2, 7)>
<5, (0, 1, 9)>
