Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are three 3-stars in the given graph. 
The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (8, 1, 9)>
<2, (3, 4, 7)>
<3, (2, 5, 6)>
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
