Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph. Here are the unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<1, (0, 5, 9)>
<2, (3, 5, 7)>
<3, (2, 4, 5)>
<4, (3, 5, 6)>
<5, (1, 2, 9)>
