Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are as follows:
[<0, (3, 5, 6)>, <1, (3, 5, 9)>, <3, (0, 1, 8)>, <5, (0, 1, 8)>]

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
