Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (0, 6, 7)>
<2, (4, 5, 6)>
<3, (8, 9, 6)>
