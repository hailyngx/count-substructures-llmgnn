Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are:

<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<2, (1, 4, 6)>
<4, (2, 6, 8)>
<6, (2, 4, 8)>
<7, (0, 1, 6)>
<8, (2, 4, 6)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
