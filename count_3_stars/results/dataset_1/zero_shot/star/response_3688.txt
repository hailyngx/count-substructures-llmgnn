Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are a total of [3] unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
    
Here are the unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 4, 7)>
<4, (0, 1, 6)>
<9, (0, 2, 7)>
