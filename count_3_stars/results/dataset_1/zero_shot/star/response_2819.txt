Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are 8 three-stars in the given graph. Here are the unique 3-stars:
    
    <0, (1, 2, 4)>
    <0, (1, 4, 9)>
    <2, (0, 5, 6)>
    <4, (0, 3, 5)>
    <4, (1, 5, 9)>
    <5, (1, 2, 4)>
    <5, (2, 4, 6)>
    <5, (4, 6, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [8].
