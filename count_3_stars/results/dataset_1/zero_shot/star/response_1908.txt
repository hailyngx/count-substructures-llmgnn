Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in this graph. Here they are listed inside <>: <0, (4, 5, 8)>, <2, (5, 6, 9)>, <3, (4, 5, 8)>, <9, (1, 2, 6)>. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4].
