Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<0, (7, 8, 9)>
<4, (6, 7, 9)>
<5, (2, 9, 0)>
<9, (8, 4, 5)>
