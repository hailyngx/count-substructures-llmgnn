Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (7, 8, 4)>
<1, (3, 9, 5)>
<3, (1, 6, 9)>
<6, (3, 4, 7)>
