Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 5 unique 3-stars in this graph. Here is the list with the central node and the connected nodes:
```
<0, (1, 3, 9)>
<1, (0, 2, 9)>
<3, (0, 4, 6)>
<4, (3, 7, 8)>
<9, (0, 1, 6)>
```
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
