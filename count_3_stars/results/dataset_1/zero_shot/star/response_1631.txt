Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 2, 8)>
<0, (3, 6, 9)>
<1, (0, 2, 6)>
<2, (0, 1, 5)>
