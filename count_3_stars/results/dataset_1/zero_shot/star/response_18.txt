Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 3, 6)>
<1, (4, 5, 8)>
<4, (1, 6, 9)>
<5, (0, 1, 9)>
