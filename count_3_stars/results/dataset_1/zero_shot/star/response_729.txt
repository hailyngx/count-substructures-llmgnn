Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is 7.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (3, 4, 8)>
<1, (2, 5, 7)>
<2, (1, 7, 2)>
<3, (0, 4, 4)>
<4, (0, 3, 8)>
<5, (1, 7, 2)>
<6, (4, 9, 9)>

Therefore, the final answer is [7].
