Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are a total of [4] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (3, 6, 9)>
<2, (7, 5, 7)>
<3, (0, 6, 9)>
<7, (2, 5, 5)>
