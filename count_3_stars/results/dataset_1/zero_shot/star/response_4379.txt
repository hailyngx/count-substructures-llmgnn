Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 4, 8)>
<0, (3, 5, 9)>
<3, (0, 5, 6)>
<4, (1, 5, 7)>
