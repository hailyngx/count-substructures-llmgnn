Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 5 unique 3-stars in this graph, which are:

<0, (2, 5, 7)>
<2, (0, 3, 5)>
<4, (6, 9, 7)>
<6, (1, 4, 9)>
<7, (5, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the final count is [5].
