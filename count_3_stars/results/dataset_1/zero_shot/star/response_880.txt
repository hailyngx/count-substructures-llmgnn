Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph. 
They are:
<0, (3, 4, 7)>
<2, (3, 7, 8)>
<3, (0, 2, 8)>
<4, (0, 7, 9)>
<6, (1, 5, 6)>
<7, (2, 4, 8)>
