Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (2, 5) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) 

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are: 

[<5, (0, 2, 4)>, <4, (7, 8, 9)>, <8, (3, 4, 6)>]

Therefore, there are **3** 3-stars in the graph. The final answer is [3].
