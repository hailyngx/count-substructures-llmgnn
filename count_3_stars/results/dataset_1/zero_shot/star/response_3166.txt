Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 3, 0)>
<1, (0, 4, 5)>
<4, (1, 6, 8)>
<7, (1, 5, 8)>
