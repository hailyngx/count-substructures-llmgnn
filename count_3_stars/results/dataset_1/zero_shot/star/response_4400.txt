Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The count is [2].
  
The 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 5, 9)>
<9, (0, 6, 7)>
