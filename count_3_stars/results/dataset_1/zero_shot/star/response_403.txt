Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
The center nodes and their respective leaves in the 3-stars in the given graph are as follows:
<0, (2, 7, -)>
<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<2, (0, 1, 4)>
<4, (1, 2, 5)>
<6, (1, 3, 9)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
