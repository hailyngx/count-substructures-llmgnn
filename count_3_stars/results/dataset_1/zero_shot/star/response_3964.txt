Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
There is a total of [3] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 4, 7)>
<4, (0, 2, 6)>
<8, (5, 6, 9)>
