Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The count is indicated within brackets.

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (4, 6, 7)>
<2, (3, 4, 9)>
<4, (1, 2, 3)>
<7, (0, 6, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
