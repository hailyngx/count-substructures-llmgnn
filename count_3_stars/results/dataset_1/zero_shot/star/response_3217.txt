Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [10] nodes and [32] edges in the given graph. To count the number of 3-stars, we need to identify each 3-star pattern.

The unique 3-stars in this graph are:
<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<1, (0, 7, 9)>
<2, (5, 8, 3)>
<4, (1, 6, 5)>
<4, (1, 5, 6)>
<4, (5, 6, 1)>
<5, (2, 9, 4)>
<6, (0, 4, 7)>
<6, (4, 7, 0)>
<7, (0, 1, 6)>
<7, (1, 6, 0)>
<8, (2, 3, 9)>
<9, (1, 7, 5)>
<9, (2, 4, 8)>

Therefore, there are [14] 3-stars in the given graph.
