Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are four 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are listed inside <> brackets:

<0, (1, 6, 9)>
<2, (6, 4, 9)>
<3, (4, 5, 6)>
<4, (3, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
