Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 3 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are:

<1, (2, 3, 5)>
<4, (0, 6, 7)>
<9, (2, 5, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
