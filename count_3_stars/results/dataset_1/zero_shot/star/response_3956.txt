Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The unique 3-stars found in the given graph are:
<0, (4, 6, 9)>
<1, (5, 6, 7)>
<2, (3, 8, 9)>
<3, (2, 2, 2)>
<4, (0, 7, 9)>
<5, (1, 1, 1)>
<6, (0, 1, 9)>
<7, (1, 4, 9)>
<8, (2, 2, 9)>
<9, (4, 6, 7)>

There are a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
