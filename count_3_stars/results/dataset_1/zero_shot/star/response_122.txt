Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the graph can be calculated by identifying all the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list the unique 3-stars first:

<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<2, (0, 1, 5)>
<3, (0, 4, 8)>
<4, (0, 3, 5)>
<5, (2, 4, 8)>
<8, (3, 5, 7)>

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
