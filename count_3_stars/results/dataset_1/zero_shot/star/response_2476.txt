Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2 and 4
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 9
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 5, and 9
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 2 and 6
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 5, and 9
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 8, and 9
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 9
- Node 8 is connected to node 5
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6

Let's find the 3-stars in this graph.

There are 5 unique 3-stars in this graph:
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<1, (4, 6, 9)>
<2, (0, 3, 5)>
<4, (0, 1, 5)>
<5, (2, 4, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
