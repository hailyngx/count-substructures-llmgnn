Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The given graph contains the following 3-stars:

[<0, (8, 4, 5)>, <1, (4, 3, 5)>, <1, (4, 5, 6)>, <3, (4, 5, 9)>, <3, (5, 1, 9)>, <3, (5, 3, 6)>, <3, (5, 4, 9)>, <5, (1, 3, 9)>, <5, (1, 4, 8)>, <5, (2, 3, 4)>]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
