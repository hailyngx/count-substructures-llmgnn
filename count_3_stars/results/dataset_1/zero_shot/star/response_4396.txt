Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 3 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here is the list of the unique 3-stars:

<0, (2, 3, 5)>
<1, (7, 9, 5)>
<4, (6, 7, 5)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
