Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 2 unique 3-stars in this graph:  
<1, (0, 2, 6)>  
<7, (3, 4, 5)>  

[The total number of 3-stars is 2]
