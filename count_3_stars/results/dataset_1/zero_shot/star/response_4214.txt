Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (2, 4, 8)>
<2, (1, 5, 8)>
<4, (1, 8, 2)>
<8, (2, 4, 1)>
