Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 5) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (7, 8, 6)>
<1, (6, 2, 4)>
<2, (4, 5, 6)>
<2, (4, 5, 6)>
<3, (5, 8, 9)>
<5, (2, 3, 8)>
<6, (1, 2, 7)>
<8, (0, 5, 9)>
