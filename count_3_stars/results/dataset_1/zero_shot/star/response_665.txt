Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in this graph is [6].  

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:  
<0, (2, 3, 4)>  
<1, (5, 6, 8)>  
<2, (0, 7, 8)>  
<3, (0, 9, 4)>  
<4, (0, 7, 8)>  
<9, (1, 3, 4)>
