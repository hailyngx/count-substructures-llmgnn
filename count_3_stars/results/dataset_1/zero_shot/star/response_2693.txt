Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [30].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (2, 4, 8)>
<1, (3, 4, 7)>
<1, (8, 4, 2)>
<2, (1, 9, 3)>
<2, (9, 1, 3)>
<3, (1, 6, 9)>
<3, (4, 6, 9)>
<3, (6, 1, 9)>
<4, (1, 5, 8)>
<4, (1, 7, 3)>
<4, (5, 1, 8)>
<4, (7, 1, 3)>
<4, (8, 1, 5)>
<4, (8, 5, 1)>
<5, (4, 6, 3)>
<5, (6, 4, 3)>
<6, (0, 3, 5)>
<6, (3, 0, 5)>
<7, (1, 4, 9)>
<7, (4, 1, 9)>
<8, (1, 4, 2)>
<8, (1, 5, 4)>
<9, (1, 2, 3)>
<9, (2, 1, 3)>
<9, (3, 1, 2)>
<9, (4, 7, 1)>
<9, (7, 1, 4)>
