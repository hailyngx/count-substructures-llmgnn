Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [3] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<0, (4, 6, 7)>
<2, (3, 5, 7)>
