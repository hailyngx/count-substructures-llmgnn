Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are as follows:
- <1, (4, 6, 7)>
- <2, (4, 9, 5)>
- <8, (1, 3, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
