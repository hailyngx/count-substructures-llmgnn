Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 3 unique 3-stars in the given graph.

The 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 6, 1)>
<2, (1, 4, 5)>
<2, (6, 8, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
