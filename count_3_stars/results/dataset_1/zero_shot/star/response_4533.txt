Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [5] 3-stars in the given graph.  
<0, (1, 6, 8)>  
<0, (2, 6, 8)>  
<1, (0, 5, 7)>  
<2, (0, 6, 8)>  
<6, (0, 2, 9)>
