Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 4) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (3, 4, 9)>
<3, (0, 6, 7)>
<4, (0, 1, 8)>
<8, (4, 6, 3)>
