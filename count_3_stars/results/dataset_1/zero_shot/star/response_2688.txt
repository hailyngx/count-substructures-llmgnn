Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The central nodes in this graph are: 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9

The 3-stars in this graph are:
<1, (0, 3, 7)>
<1, (4, 6, 7)>
<2, (5, 8, 9)>
<4, (1, 6, 7)>
<6, (4, 8, 9)>
<7, (1, 2, 9)>
<8, (5, 6, 9)>
<9, (2, 6, 7)>

Therefore, there are [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
