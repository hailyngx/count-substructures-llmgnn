Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (3, 8, 1)>
<2, (4, 6, 9)>
<4, (2, 3, 7)>
<5, (6, 8, 4)>
<7, (1, 4, 9)>
