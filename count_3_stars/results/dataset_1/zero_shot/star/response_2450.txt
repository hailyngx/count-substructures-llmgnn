Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are a total of 4 unique 3-stars present in the given graph: 

1. <0, (1, 5, 8)>
2. <1, (0, 2, 3)>
3. <4, (5, 7, 8)>
4. <5, (0, 1, 4)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
