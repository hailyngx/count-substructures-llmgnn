Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (2, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 5) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.  
<0, (1, 6, 7)>, <1, (0, 6, 7)>, <5, (6, 7, 8)>, <7, (3, 4, 6)>
