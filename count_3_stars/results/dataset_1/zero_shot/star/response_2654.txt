Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (3, 7, 1)>
<1, (2, 8, 7)>
<2, (1, 5, 8)>
<3, (0, 5, 4)>
<4, (3, 5, 9)>
<5, (2, 4, 6)>
