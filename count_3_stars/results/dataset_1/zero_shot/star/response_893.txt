Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (3, 8, 1)>
<3, (0, 1, 8)>
<1, (3, 5, 7)>
<8, (0, 3, 4)>
