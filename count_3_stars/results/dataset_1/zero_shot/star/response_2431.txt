Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [8].

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (2, 5, 9)>
<1, (2, 6, 9)>
<2, (0, 1, 6)>
<2, (1, 3, 6)>
<4, (5, 7, 8)>
<6, (1, 2, 9)>
<7, (4, 5, 8)>
<7, (4, 6, 8)>
