Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are a total of [12] 3-star subgraphs in the given graph.

The unique 3-star subgraphs are:
<0, (4, 5, 9)>
<1, (2, 5, 6)>
<2, (1, 3, 6)>
<3, (2, 6, 7)>
<4, (0, 7, 9)>
<4, (7, 8, 9)>
<5, (0, 1, 9)>
<6, (1, 3, 9)>
<7, (3, 4, 9)>
<7, (4, 8, 9)>
<8, (4, 7, 9)>
<9, (0, 4, 5)>
