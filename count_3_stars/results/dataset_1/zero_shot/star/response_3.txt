Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in this graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<4, (0, 1, 2)>
<4, (6, 7, 9)>
<5, (0, 6, 7)>
<6, (4, 5, 7)>
<9, (3, 4, 6)>
