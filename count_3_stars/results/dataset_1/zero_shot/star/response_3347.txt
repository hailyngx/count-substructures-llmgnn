Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The 3-stars are:

<0, (1, 7, 0)>
<1, (0, 2, 8)>
<2, (1, 5, 6)>
<3, (4, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
