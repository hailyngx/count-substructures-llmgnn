Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 3-stars in the given graph. The unique 3-stars are:

<0, (1, 8, 4)>
<1, (0, 2, 4)>
<2, (1, 3, 3)>
<3, (2, 4, 6)>
<4, (1, 3, 8)>
<5, (6, 8, 9)>
<6, (3, 5, 9)>
<7, (9, 6, 0)>
<8, (0, 4, 6)>
<9, (7, 5, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [10].
