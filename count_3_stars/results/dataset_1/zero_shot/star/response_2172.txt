Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars present in the given graph. Here they are:

<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<4, (1, 3, 8)>
<6, (1, 5, 7)>
<8, (0, 4, 9)>

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
