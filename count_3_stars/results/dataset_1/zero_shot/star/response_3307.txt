Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph:
<0, (2, 6, 9)>
<1, (3, 5, 9)>
<3, (1, 6, 7)>
<5, (1, 4, 8)>
<7, (3, 8, 9)>
<8, (1, 4, 7)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
