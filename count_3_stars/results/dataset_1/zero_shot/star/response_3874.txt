Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in this graph. Here they are:
<0, (2, 3, 7)>
<0, (2, 5, 8)>
<2, (0, 8, 9)>
<3, (0, 8, 5)>
<5, (0, 1, 6)>
<6, (4, 5, 9)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
