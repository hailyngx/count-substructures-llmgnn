Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 4) (8, 4) (8, 6) 

Response:
There are 6 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the final answer is [6].
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
   <0, (1, 2, 6)>
   <2, (0, 3, 4)>
   <4, (2, 7, 8)>
   <6, (1, 8, 0)>
   <7, (4, 8, 2)>
   <8, (4, 6, 7)>
