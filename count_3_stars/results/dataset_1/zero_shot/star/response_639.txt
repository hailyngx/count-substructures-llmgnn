Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph.

<0, (5, 8, 9)>
<2, (4, 6, 7)>
<3, (7, 9, 4)>
<4, (2, 6, 7)>
<5, (0, 6, 8)>
<7, (1, 3, 9)>
