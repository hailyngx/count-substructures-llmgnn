Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (3, 5, 7)>
<1, (6, 8, 2)>
<2, (6, 4, 8)>
<3, (0, 4, 5)>
<4, (2, 5, 9)>
<8, (1, 6, 9)>
