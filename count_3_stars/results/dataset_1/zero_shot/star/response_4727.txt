Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
  
  The unique 3-stars are:
  <0, (3, 6, 8)>
  <0, (3, 6, 9)>
  <0, (3, 8, 9)>
  <1, (5, 7, 8)>
  <1, (5, 7, 9)>
  <1, (5, 8, 9)>
