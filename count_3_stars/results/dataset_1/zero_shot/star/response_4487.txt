Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.  

<0, (1, 9, 9)>
<3, (2, 8, 9)>
<5, (6, 7, 8)>
<9, (1, 3, 5)>
