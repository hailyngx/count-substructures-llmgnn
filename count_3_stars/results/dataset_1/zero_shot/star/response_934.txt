Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 3 unique 3-stars in the given graph:

<1, (2, 4, 5)>
<2, (1, 4, 7)>
<4, (2, 5, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
