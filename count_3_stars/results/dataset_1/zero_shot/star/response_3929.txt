Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are [10] nodes and [38] edges in the given graph. Let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph.

Let's list the 3-stars present in the graph:

<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<0, (1, 4, 8)>
<0, (1, 6, 8)>
<1, (0, 2, 4)>
<1, (0, 4, 6)>
<1, (0, 4, 9)>
<4, (0, 1, 2)>
<4, (0, 2, 5)>
<4, (1, 2, 8)>
<4, (1, 5, 7)>
<4, (2, 5, 7)>
<4, (5, 7, 8)>
<5, (2, 4, 8)>
<5, (4, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].
