Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.  

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 8, 5)>
<1, (0, 9, 8)>
<7, (9, 0, 2)>
<4, (0, 6, 8)>
