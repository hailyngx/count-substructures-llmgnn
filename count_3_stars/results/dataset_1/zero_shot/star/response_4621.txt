Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are a total of [7] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<1, (0, 7, 8)>
<1, (7, 8, 9)>
<3, (0, 6, 8)>
<3, (6, 8, 9)>
<5, (0, 9, 0)>
<9, (1, 3, 5)>
