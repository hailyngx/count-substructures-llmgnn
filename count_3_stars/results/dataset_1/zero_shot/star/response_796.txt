Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-star subgraphs in the given graph.

<0, (1, 3, 8)>
<3, (0, 5, 7)>
<4, (5, 6, 9)>
<8, (0, 3, 9)>
