Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:
[<0, (3, 4, 7)>, <2, (5, 6, 8)>, <3, (0, 5, 9)>, <4, (0, 6, 5)>, <5, (2, 6, 8)>, <6, (2, 4, 5)>, <7, (0, 2, -)>, <8, (2, 5, -)>, <9, (3, 5, -)>]

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
