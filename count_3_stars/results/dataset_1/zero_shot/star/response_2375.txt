Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The graph has the following 3-stars:
[<0, (1, 2, 3)>, <0, (2, 4, 9)>, <1, (0, 3, 7)>, <2, (0, 4, 7)>, <3, (0, 1, 8)>, <4, (2, 8, 9)>, <5, (7, 9, 5)>, <6, (7, 6, 7)>, <7, (1, 5, 6)>, <8, (3, 4, 8)>, <9, (0, 2, 5)>]
Therefore, there are 11 3-stars in this graph. [11]
