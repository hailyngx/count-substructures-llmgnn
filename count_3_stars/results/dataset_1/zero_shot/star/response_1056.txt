Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be found by looking at all the possible combinations of the nodes that form valid 3-stars based on the definition provided.

There are four 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are listed inside brackets [].
