Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 0) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph.  
The 3-stars are:
1. <0, (2, 4, 6)>
2. <4, (0, 2, 3)>
3. <2, (0, 4, 4)>
4. <6, (0, 0, 0)>
5. <9, (1, 8, 8)>  
  
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [5].
