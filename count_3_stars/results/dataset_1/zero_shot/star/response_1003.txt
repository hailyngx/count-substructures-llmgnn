Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 3-stars with the following unique configurations: <0, (1, 2, 7)>, <1, (0, 2, 4)>, <3, (0, 4, 6)>, <4, (1, 3, 7)>, <6, (0, 3, 5)>, <7, (0, 2, 4)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
