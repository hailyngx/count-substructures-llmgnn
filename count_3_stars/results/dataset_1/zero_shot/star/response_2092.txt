Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 4 3-stars in the given graph. 
The unique 3-stars are <0, (1, 5, 8)>, <1, (0, 4, 5)>, <4, (1, 2, 9)>, and <5, (0, 1, 6)>.
Therefore, the final answer is [4].
