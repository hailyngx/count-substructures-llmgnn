Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) 

Response:
[]
    There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.
    The unique 3-stars are: 
    <0, (2, 4, 6)>
    <2, (0, 5, 7)>
    <3, (1, 7, -)>
    <5, (2, 6, 8)>
