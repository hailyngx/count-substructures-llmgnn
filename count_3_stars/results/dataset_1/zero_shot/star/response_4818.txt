Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph contains 7 unique 3-stars. Therefore, the answer is [7].
The 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 3, 3)>
<1, (0, 3, 5)>
<1, (3, 1, 7)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<3, (1, 0, 6)>
<5, (1, 9, 5)>
<7, (1, 9, 7)>
