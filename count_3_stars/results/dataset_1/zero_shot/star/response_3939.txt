Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph can be calculated as follows: 

1. For each node, check the number of adjacencies it has. If a node has exactly three adjacencies, then it is a center of a 3-star.
2. Once we identify the central node, we look at its neighbors to find the leaves of the 3-star.
3. We then mark the identified 3-stars and count them at the end.

Let's go ahead and find the 3-stars:

There are three possible 3-stars in this graph. The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<2, (5, 6, 8)>
<6, (3, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
