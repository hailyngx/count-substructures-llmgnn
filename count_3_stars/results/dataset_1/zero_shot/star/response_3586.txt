Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in this graph. The unique 3-stars are <0, (2, 3, 6)>, <1, (5, 8, 9)>, <3, (0, 5, 8)>, and <9, (1, 3, 7)>.
