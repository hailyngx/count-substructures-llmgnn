Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are a total of 6 different 3-stars in the given graph. The 3-stars are:

<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<1, (2, 3, 5)>
<3, (0, 1, 9)>
<4, (8, 9, -)>
<5, (0, 1, 7)>
<9, (1, 4, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
