Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are 3 3-stars in the given graph. The unique 3-stars are:

<0, (6, 5, 7)>
<1, (7, 8, 2)>
<9, (2, 4, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
