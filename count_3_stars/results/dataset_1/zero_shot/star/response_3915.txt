Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (5, 6, 9)>
<1, (3, 4, 5)>
<3, (1, 5, 6)>
<3, (5, 6, 9)>
