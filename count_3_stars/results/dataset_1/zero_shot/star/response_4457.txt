Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph, which are:

<0, (2, 5, 6)>
<2, (3, 5, 6)>
<3, (4, 6, 9)>
<4, (3, 6, 8)>
<5, (0, 2, 6)>
<6, (2, 3, 8)>
