Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are represented inside <>:
<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<1, (5, 6, 7)>
<1, (5, 6, 8)>
<4, (0, 2, 6)>
<4, (3, 6, 7)>
<4, (3, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the answer is [6].
