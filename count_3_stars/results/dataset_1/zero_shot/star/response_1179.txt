Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 6 different 3-stars in this graph. The 3-stars are as follows:

<0, (3, 8, 5)>
<1, (2, 5, 6)>
<2, (1, 3, 6)>
<3, (0, 2, 5)>
<5, (1, 3, 8)>
<9, (4, 5, )>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
