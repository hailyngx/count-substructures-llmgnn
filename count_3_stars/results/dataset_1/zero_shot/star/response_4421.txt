Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 4) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 3, 6)>
<1, (0, 2, 4)>
<2, (1, 4, 5)>
<4, (1, 2, 7)>
