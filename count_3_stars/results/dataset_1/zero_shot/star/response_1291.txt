Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:
- <0, (1, 4, 6)>
- <1, (0, 4, 6)>
- <2, (4, 5, 9)>
- <3, (0, 4, 8)>
- <4, (0, 1, 2)>
- <5, (2, 6, 9)>
- <6, (0, 1, 4)>
- <7, (2, 8, 9)>
- <8, (2, 3, 7)>
- <9, (0, 1, 5)>

Counting the number of 3-stars, we find a total of [10] such structures in the given graph.
