Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The graph contains [5] 3-stars.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<1, (6, 8, 9)>
<2, (8, 9, 1)>
<6, (0, 1, 8)>
<9, (1, 2, 8)>
