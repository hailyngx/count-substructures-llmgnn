Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
    
The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<0, (3, 6, 7)>
<0, (3, 7, 8)>
<0, (5, 6, 7)>
<0, (6, 7, 8)>
