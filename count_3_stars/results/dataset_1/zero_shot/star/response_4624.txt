Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (2, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are two 3-star graphs in the given graph. Let's identify and count them:

1. 3-star centered at node 4: (4, 2, 5, 6)
2. 3-star centered at node 6: (6, 1, 4, 9)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2]. The unique 3-stars are <4, (2, 5, 6)> and <6, (1, 4, 9)>.
