Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are a total of [12] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 4, 6)>
<1, (6, 9, 0)>
<2, (5, 8, 0)>
<3, (0, 4, 7)>
<4, (0, 7, 3)>
<5, (2, 8, 0)>
<6, (0, 1, 9)>
<7, (3, 4, 0)>
<8, (2, 5, 0)>
<9, (6, 1, 0)>
