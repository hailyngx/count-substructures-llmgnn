Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (3, 4, 8)>
<1, (3, 6, 7)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<3, (4, 5, 9)>
<6, (1, 2, 5)>
