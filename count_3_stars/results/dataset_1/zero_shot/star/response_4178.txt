Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (6, 4) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) 

Response:
There are <0, (5, 8, 7)>, <1, (3, 4, 6)>, and <2, (8, 7, 4)> 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [3].
