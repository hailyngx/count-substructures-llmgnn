Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) 

Response:
There are a total of [9] 3-stars in the given graph. Here are the unique 3-stars:
<0, (3, 5, 7)>
<0, (3, 7, 8)>
<1, (3, 7, 0)>
<2, (3, 4, 8)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<4, (2, 8, 0)>
<5, (0, 6, 5)>
<6, (5, 0, 0)>
<7, (0, 1, 3)>
