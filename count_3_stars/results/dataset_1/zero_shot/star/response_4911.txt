Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (4, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph is as follows:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (0, 4), (0, 8), (1, 3), (1, 7), (2, 6), (2, 7), (3, 1), (4, 0), (6, 2), (6, 7), (6, 9), (7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 6), (8, 0), (9, 6)

To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we examine each node as a potential center and count the number of 3-stars it is part of.

The 3-stars in this graph are:
<0, (4, 8, 7)>
<1, (3, 7, 2)>
<2, (6, 7, 1)>
<3, (1, 7, 6)>
<4, (0, 8, 7)>
<6, (2, 7, 9)>
<7, (1, 2, 6)>
<8, (0, 7, 2)>
<9, (6, 7, 3)>

Thus, there are [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
