Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph. The unique 3-stars are:

<0, (2, 3, 8)>
<1, (3, 4, 7)>
<1, (3, 8, 9)>
<3, (0, 1, 8)>
<4, (1, 5, 6)>
<5, (3, 4, 6)>
