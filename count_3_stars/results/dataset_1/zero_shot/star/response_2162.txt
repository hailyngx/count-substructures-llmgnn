Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph: 
<0, (1, 5, 6)> 
<2, (3, 5, 9)>
Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
