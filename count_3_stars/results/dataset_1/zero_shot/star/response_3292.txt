Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 5 unique 3-stars in this graph. 

The 3-stars are:
<0, (5, 8, 9)>
<1, (8, 9, 0)>
<3, (6, 9, 4)>
<2, (4, 6, 8)>
<7, (5, 6, 9)>

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
