Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (5, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) 

Response:
There are a total of 6 unique 3-star subgraphs in the given graph:
    
    [<0, (1, 4, 7)>, <1, (0, 4, 7)>, <3, (5, 8, 8)>, <4, (1, 0, 7)>, <5, (3, 3, 8)>, <7, (1, 0, 8)>]
    
    Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
