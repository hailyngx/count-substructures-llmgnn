Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 6) (9, 4) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:

[<0, (1, 2, 7)>, <1, (0, 3, 7)>, <2, (0, 7, 7)>]

Therefore, there are [3] unique 3-stars in the graph.
