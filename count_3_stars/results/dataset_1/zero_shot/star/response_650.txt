Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 3 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
The 3-stars are: 
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<2, (1, 3, 6)>
<9, (0, 8, -)> 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
