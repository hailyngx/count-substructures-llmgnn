Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are [5] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<2, (3, 4, 5)>
<3, (1, 2, 9)>
<4, (1, 2, 5)>
