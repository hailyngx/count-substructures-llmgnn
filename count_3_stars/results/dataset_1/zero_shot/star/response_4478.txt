Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The graph contains the following 3-stars:
    - <0, (2, 6, 8)>
    - <2, (0, 4, 9)>
    - <6, (0, 7, 8)>
    - <8, (0, 1, 6)>
    - <9, (2, 4, 6)>
