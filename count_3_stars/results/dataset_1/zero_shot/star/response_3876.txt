Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (3, 8, 1)>
<1, (3, 7, 0)>
<2, (5, 9, 0)>
<3, (0, 7, 6)>
<7, (4, 8, 1)>
<8, (7, 9, 4)>
