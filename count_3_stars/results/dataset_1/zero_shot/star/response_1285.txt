Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of 4 3-stars in the given graph. Here are the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (5, 2, 4)>
<1, (2, 8, 8)>
<3, (6, 9, 9)>
<5, (0, 2, 4)>

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
