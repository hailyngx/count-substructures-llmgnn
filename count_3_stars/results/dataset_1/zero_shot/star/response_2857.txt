Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (6, 7, 8)>
<1, (3, 6, 2)>
<3, (1, 4, 8)>
<7, (0, 5, 9)>
