Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are:

<0, (6, 9)>
<1, (4, 5)>
<3, (1, 8)>
<8, (1, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
