Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be calculated by identifying all instances where a node is connected to three other nodes, thus forming a 3-star structure.

From the provided information, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (2, 6, 7)>
<2, (0, 3, 8)>
<3, (2, 5, 9)>
<8, (0, 2, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
