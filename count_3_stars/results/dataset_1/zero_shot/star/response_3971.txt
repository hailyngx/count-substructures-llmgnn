Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 1) (4, 2) (5, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
There are [8] 3-stars in this graph.

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (8, 1, 7)>
<1, (8, 5, 9)>
<1, (5, 1, 9)>
<8, (1, 0, 7)>
<8, (1, 0, 7)>
<2, (4, 4, 4)>
<4, (2, 2, 2)>
<5, (1, 1, 1)>
