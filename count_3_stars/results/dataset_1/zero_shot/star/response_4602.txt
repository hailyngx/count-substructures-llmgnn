Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 44 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in this graph. Here they are listed inside angle brackets <>:

<0, (2, 7, 9)>
<5, (2, 6, 9)>
<7, (0, 5, 9)>
<8, (0, 3, 4)>

So the final answer is [4].
