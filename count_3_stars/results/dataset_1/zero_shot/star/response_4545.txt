Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in this graph. Here they are:

<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<1, (0, 4, 7)>
<2, (4, 5, 9)>
<3, (5, 7, 9)>
<4, (1, 2, 9)>
<5, (0, 2, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
