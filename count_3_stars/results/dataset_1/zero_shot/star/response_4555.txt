Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (5, 2) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:
- <0, (7, 8, -)>
- <2, (3, 5, 6)>
- <3, (2, 4, 7)>
- <7, (0, 3, 8)>

Therefore, there are [4] 3-stars in the graph.
