Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 5 different 3-stars in the given graph. They are:

<0, (3, 4, 7)>
<1, (3, 6, -)>
<2, (3, 8, -)>
<5, (8, 9, -)>
<7, (0, 6, -)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
