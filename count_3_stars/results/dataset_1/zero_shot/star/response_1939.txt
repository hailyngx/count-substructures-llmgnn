Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are <0, (5, 7, 8)>, <1, (3, 5, 9)>, and <3, (1, 5, 6)> 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
