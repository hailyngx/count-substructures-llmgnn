Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-star structures in the given graph.  

The unique 3-stars are:

<0, (2, 4, 8)>
<1, (4, 7, 9)>
<2, (0, 4, 7)>
<7, (1, 3, 9)>
