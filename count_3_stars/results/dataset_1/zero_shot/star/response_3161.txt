Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 3-star graphs in the given graph.
