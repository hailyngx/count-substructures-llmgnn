Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are: 

<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<1, (0, 3, 8)>
<3, (1, 5, 8)>
<4, (0, 5, 8)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
