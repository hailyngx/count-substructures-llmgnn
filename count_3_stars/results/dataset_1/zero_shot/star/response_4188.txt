Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [5] 3-star graphs in the given graph. 
<0, (3, 4, 6)>, <1, (2, 5, 7)>, <2, (1, 4, 7)>, <4, (0, 2, 7)>, <7, (1, 2, 4)>
