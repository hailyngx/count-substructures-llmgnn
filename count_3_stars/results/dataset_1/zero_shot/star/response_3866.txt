Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph, which are:
<2, (1, 4, 7)>
<4, (2, 3, 6)>
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
