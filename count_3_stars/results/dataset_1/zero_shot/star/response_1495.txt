Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are [8] 3-stars in the given graph.  
The unique 3-stars are:   
<0, (3, 1, 7)>  
<1, (3, 7, 9)>  
<2, (4, 5, 9)>  
<2, (5, 3, 7)>  
<3, (0, 1, 4)>  
<6, (7, 3, 5)>  
<7, (1, 3, 5)>  
<8, (3, 1, 7)>
