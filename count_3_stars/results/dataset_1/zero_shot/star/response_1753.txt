Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of [4] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<1, (3, 6, 7)>
<4, (0, 8, 5)>
<7, (9, 1, 6)>
