Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph can be determined by finding all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars present in the graph.

The nodes connected to exactly three other nodes are:
- Node 0 (connected to nodes 1, 2, and 3)
- Node 2 (connected to nodes 0, 4, and 6)
- Node 7 (connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 8)
- Node 9 (connected to nodes 2, 3, and 8)

Therefore, the 3-stars in the given graph are:
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<2, (0, 4, 6)>
<7, (1, 2, 4)>
<9, (2, 3, 8)>

Count of 3-stars in the graph: [4]
