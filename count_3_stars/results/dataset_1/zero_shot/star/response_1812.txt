Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph contains the following 3-stars:
[<0, (3, 6, 8)>, <0, (6, 9, 8)>, <2, (1, 5, 6)>, <2, (5, 6, 7)>, <3, (0, 7, 9)>, <5, (2, 4, 6)>, <5, (4, 6, 5)>, <6, (0, 2, 9)>, <7, (1, 3, 6)>]

Therefore, there are a total of [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
