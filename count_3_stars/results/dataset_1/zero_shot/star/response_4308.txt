Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The task is to count the number of 3-stars in the given graph. A 3-star graph consists of a central node connected to exactly three leaves. Let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph.

From the given edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:
1. <1, (2, 4, 6)>
2. <1, (2, 9, 6)>
3. <1, (4, 9, 6)>
4. <3, (0, 5, 9)>
5. <3, (2, 5, 9)>
6. <3, (8, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
