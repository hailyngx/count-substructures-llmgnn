Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 6, 8)>
<2, (0, 4, 7)>
<3, (2, 4, 8)>
<4, (2, 3, 7)>
<5, (3, 6, 7)>
<9, (1, 2, 6)>
