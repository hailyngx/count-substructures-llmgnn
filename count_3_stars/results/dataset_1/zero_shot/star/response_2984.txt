Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are:
<0, (5, 6, 7)>
<1, (3, 4, 5)>
<2, (4, 5, 6)>
<3, (1, 4, 7)>
<4, (1, 2, 3)>
<5, (0, 1, 2)>
<6, (0, 2, 5)>
<7, (1, 3, 5)>
<8, (1, 2, 4)>
<9, (3, 7, 9)>

Therefore, there are 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Hence, the answer is [10].
