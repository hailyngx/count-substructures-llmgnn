Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is:

\[ [12] \]

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

\[
<0, (2, 3, 9)>, <0, (3, 2, 8)>, <0, (6, 1, 8)>, <0, (8, 1, 2)>, <3, (0, 2, 9)>, <3, (2, 0, 8)>, <3, (7, 5, 9)>, <3, (9, 0, 2)>, <6, (0, 1, 8)>, <6, (1, 0, 8)>, <8, (0, 1, 6)>, <8, (1, 0, 6)>
