Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be calculated by finding the number of 3-stars centered at each node and then summing them up. 

Starting with the given edges, we can identify the 3-stars centered at each node:
- Node 0: (0, 3, 4), (0, 3, 8), (0, 4, 8) 
- Node 1: (1, 4, 2) 
- Node 2: (2, 3, 4), (2, 3, 8), (2, 4, 8) 
- Node 3: (3, 0, 2), (3, 0, 8), (3, 2, 8), (3, 6, 4) 
- Node 4: (4, 0, 2), (4, 0, 6), (4, 0, 9), (4, 1, 2) 
- Node 5: (5, 8, 9) 
- Node 6: (6, 3, 4) 
- Node 8: (8, 0, 2), (8, 0, 5), (8, 2, 3), (8, 2, 5) 
- Node 9: (9, 4, 5) 

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the graph are:
<0, (3, 4, 8)>
<1, (2, 4, 1)>
<2, (3, 4, 8)>
<3, (0, 2, 8)>
<3, (4, 6, 3)>
<4, (0, 2, 4)>
<4, (0, 6, 4)>
<4, (1, 2, 4)>
<5, (8, 9, 5)>
<6, (3, 4, 6)>
<8, (0, 2, 8)>
<8, (0, 5, 8)>
<8, (2, 3, 8)>
<8, (2, 5, 8)>
<9, (4, 5, 9)>

Counting these unique 3-stars, we find that there are [15] 3-stars in the given graph.
