Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph. The unique 3-stars are as follows:
   - <0, (1, 2, 8)>
   - <1, (0, 6, 2)>
   - <2, (0, 3, 4)>
   - <2, (0, 4, 6)>
   - <3, (2, 7, 9)>
   - <4, (2, 0, 6)>
   - <6, (1, 2, 0)>
   - <7, (3, 2, 9)>
