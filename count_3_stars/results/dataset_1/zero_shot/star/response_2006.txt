Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph contains the following 3-stars:

[<1, (0, 6, 8)>, <2, (4, 8, 9)>, <3, (5, 8, -)>, <4, (2, 7, 8)>, <5, (3, 7, -)>, <6, (1, 9, -)>, <7, (4, 5, 8)>, <8, (1, 2, 3)>, <9, (2, 6, -)>]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
