Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:
- <0, (2, 8, 1)>
- <2, (0, 6, 7)>
- <4, (5, 8, 9)>
- <5, (4, 6, 9)>
- <6, (2, 5, 7)>
- <7, (6, 8, 9)>
- <8, (0, 4, 7)>
- <9, (3, 4, 5)>

Counting the number of 3-stars, we get a total of [8].
