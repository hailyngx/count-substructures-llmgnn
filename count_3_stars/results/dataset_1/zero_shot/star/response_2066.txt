Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 2 different 3-stars in the given graph. The count is shown below:

[2]

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (0, 3, 6)>
<4, (1, 7, 9)>
