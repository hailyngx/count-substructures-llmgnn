Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 9, 9)>
<1, (0, 6, 7)>
<5, (7, 8, 9)>
<6, (1, 9, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 6)>
