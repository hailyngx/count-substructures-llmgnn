Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
   
   <0, (1, 2, 4)>
   <1, (0, 2, 7)>
   <2, (0, 1, 9)>
   <3, (1, 6, 9)>
   <4, (0, 6, 7)>
   <6, (3, 4, 9)>
   <7, (0, 1, 4)>
   <9, (1, 2, 4)>
