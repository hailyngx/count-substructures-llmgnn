Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (8, 5, 6)>
<1, (2, 9, 7)>
<2, (1, 9, 3)>
<3, (4, 6, 9)>
<5, (7, 8, 9)>
<7, (5, 8, 9)>
