Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 2, 7)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<2, (0, 4, 7)>
<3, (1, 4, 7)>
<4, (1, 2, 3)>
<7, (0, 3, 4)>
