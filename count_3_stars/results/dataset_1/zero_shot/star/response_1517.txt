Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
The 3-star structures in the given graph are as follows: 
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<1, (0, 6, 7)>
<2, (0, 3, 5)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<4, (6, 7, 8)>
<5, (2, 6, 8)>
<6, (1, 4, 5)>
<7, (0, 1, 3)>
<8, (1, 4, 9)>
<9, (8)>

Therefore, there are a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
