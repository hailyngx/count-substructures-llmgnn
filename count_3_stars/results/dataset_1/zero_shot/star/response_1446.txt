Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

The 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 3, 6)>
<5, (1, 4, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
