Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
There is a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 4, 7)>
<1, (0, 4, 8)>
<3, (2, 6, 7)>
<4, (0, 1, 7)>
<6, (3, 9, 7)>
<8, (1, 2, 5)>
