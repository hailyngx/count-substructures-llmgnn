Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are a total of 4 three-stars in the given graph. Here they are:

[4, (7, 0, 9) ; 6, (7, 6, 8) ; 7, (0, 9, 6) ; 8, (1, 7, 8)]

Therefore, the final answer inside brackets is [4].
