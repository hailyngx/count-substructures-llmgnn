Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 8 total 3-stars in the given graph. Here is the list of unique 3-stars found inside brackets []:

[<0, (1, 5, 6)>, <1, (0, 5, 6)>, <1, (5, 6, 9)>, <2, (5, 9, 3)>, <3, (4, 9, 2)>, <4, (3, 9, 2)>, <5, (0, 1, 6)>, <9, (1, 6, 3)>]
