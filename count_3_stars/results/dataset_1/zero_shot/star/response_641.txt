Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here is the calculation:

1. 3-star centered at node 0: <0, (4, 8, 3)>
2. 3-star centered at node 5: <5, (1, 3, 7)>

The total number of 3-stars is [2].
