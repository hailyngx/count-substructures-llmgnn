Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are <0, (1, 2, 3)>, <1, (0, 4, 5)>, <2, (0, 6, 7)>, and <3, (0, 6, 9)> 3-stars in the given graph. Hence, the total number of 3-stars is [4].
