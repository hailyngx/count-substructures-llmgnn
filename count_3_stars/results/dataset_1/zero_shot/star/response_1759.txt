Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
There are [3] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (5, 8, 9)>
<1, (3, 6, 8)>
<8, (1, 5, 6)>
