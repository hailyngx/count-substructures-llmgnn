Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in this graph is [3].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<1, (0, 5, 8)>
<8, (1, 6, 9)>
