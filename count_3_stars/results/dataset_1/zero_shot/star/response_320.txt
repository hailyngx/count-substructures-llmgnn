Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of [3] 3-star subgraphs in this graph. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 4, 8)>
<1, (4, 6, 7)>
<2, (1, 5, 8)>
