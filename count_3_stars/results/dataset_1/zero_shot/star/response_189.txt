Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<1, (0, 4, 6)>
<2, (0, 3, 4)>
<3, (0, 2, 8)>
<6, (1, 7, 8)>
