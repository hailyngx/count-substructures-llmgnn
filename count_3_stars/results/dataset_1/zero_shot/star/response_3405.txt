Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be calculated by examining the nodes that have exactly 3 neighbors connected to them. Since each 3-star contains 4 nodes (1 center node and 3 leaves), we can identify the unique 3-stars as follows:

<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<1, (0, 7, 9)>
<3, (0, 2, 8)>
<5, (0, 7, 8)>
<7, (1, 4, 5)>
<8, (0, 3, 5)>
<9, (1, 7, 9)>

Counting these unique 3-stars, we find that there are [7] 3-stars in the given graph.
