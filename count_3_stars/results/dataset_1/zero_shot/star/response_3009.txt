Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars are: 
<2, (1, 7, 9)>
<3, (2, 5, 7)>
<5, (3, 6, 9)>
<6, (3, 5, 8)>
