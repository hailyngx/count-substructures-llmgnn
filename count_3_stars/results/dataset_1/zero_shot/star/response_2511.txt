Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [0].

The 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (3, 5, 8)>
<2, (3, 6, 7)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<3, (1, 3, 5)>
<3, (2, 6, 7)>
<3, (8, 9, 3)>
<6, (2, 4, 6)>
<7, (2, 3, 5)>
<9, (6, 8, 9)>
