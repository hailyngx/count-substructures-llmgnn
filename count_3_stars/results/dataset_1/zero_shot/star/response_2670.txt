Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 0) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are:

1. <0, (1, 3, 6)>
2. <1, (0, 7, 8)>
3. <2, (5, 6, -)>
4. <9, (0, -, -)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
