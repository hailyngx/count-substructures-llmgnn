Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) 

Response:
The first step is to identify all the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 1: <1, (3, 4, 5)>
2. Node 3: <3, (1, 5, 6)>
3. Node 4: <4, (1, 7, -)>
4. Node 5: <5, (3, 8, -)>
5. Node 6: <6, (3, 7, -)>
6. Node 7: <7, (2, 4, 6)>
7. Node 8: <8, (5, 7, -)>

Count of 3-stars: [7]
