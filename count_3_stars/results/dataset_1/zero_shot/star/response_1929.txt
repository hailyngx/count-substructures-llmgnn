Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph can be found by examining each node to see if it is the center of a 3-star. A 3-star is formed if a node has exactly three edges connected to it. 

After analyzing the graph, we can see that there are 4 unique 3-stars present. Therefore, the answer is [4].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<2, (0, 3, 9)>
<4, (0, 2, 7)>
<9, (0, 2, 5)>
