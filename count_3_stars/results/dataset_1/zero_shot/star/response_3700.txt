Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

The 3-stars are:
<4, (5, 6, 8)>
<5, (4, 6, 7)>
<6, (0, 3, 4)>
<8, (5, 6, 9)>

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
