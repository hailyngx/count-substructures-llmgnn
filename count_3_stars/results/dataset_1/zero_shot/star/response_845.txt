Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:
[<0, (1, 5, 9)>, <1, (0, 2, 3)>, <3, (1, 4, 8)>, <4, (1, 3, 5)>, <5, (0, 1, 2)>, <7, (1, 2, 9)>, <9, (5, 6, 7)>]
