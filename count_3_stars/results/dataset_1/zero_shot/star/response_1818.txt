Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (3, 8, 9)>
<3, (1, 8, 9)>
<5, (8, 9, 7)>
<7, (4, 5, 9)>
<8, (0, 1, 2)>
<9, (1, 5, 7)>
