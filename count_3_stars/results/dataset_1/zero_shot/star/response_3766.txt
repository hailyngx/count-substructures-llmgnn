Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-star configurations are:
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<1, (4, 7, 9)>
<2, (5, 7, 8)>
<3, (0, 4, 5)>
