Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (3, 6, 9)>
<1, (7, 8, 2)>
<2, (7, 9, 6)>
<3, (0, 6, 9)>
<4, (5, 7, 8)>
<5, (4, 8, 7)>
<6, (3, 2, 9)>
<7, (1, 8, 2)>
<8, (1, 7, 5)>
