Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The central nodes with exactly three leaves in the given graph are Node 0, Node 1, Node 5, Node 8, and Node 9. 

There are 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph: 
<0, (4, 7, 8)>
<1, (6, 9, 7)>
<5, (3, 8, 8)>
<8, (0, 5, 9)>
<9, (1, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
