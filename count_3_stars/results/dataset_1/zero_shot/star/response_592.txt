Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The graph has the following 3-stars:
[<0, (3, 8, 1)>, <1, (2, 7, 8)>, <2, (1, 5, 6)>, <3, (0, 2, 5)>, <5, (1, 2, 9)>, <8, (0, 1, 9)>]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
