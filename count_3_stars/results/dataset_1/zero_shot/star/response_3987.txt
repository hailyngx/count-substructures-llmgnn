Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph.  
The 3-stars are:   
<0, (3, 5, 7)>  
<0, (3, 7, 9)>  
<1, (2, 3, 7)>  
<3, (0, 1, 2)>  
<3, (5, 6, 7)>  
<6, (3, 5, 7)>  

Therefore, the final answer is [6].
