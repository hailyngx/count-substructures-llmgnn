Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) 

Response:
There are [2] 3-stars in the given graph.  

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<3, (1, 2, 6)>
