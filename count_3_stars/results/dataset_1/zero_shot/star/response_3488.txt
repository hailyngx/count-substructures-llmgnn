Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be found by counting the number of incidents where a node has exactly three edges connecting it to three other nodes. 

By analyzing the edges in the graph, we can determine the following unique 3-stars:

<0, (4, 9, 3)>
<1, (7, 8, 9)>
<2, (5, 6, 9)>
<3, (4, 7, \_)> - Incomplete 3-star, missing one connection.
<4, (0, 8, \_)> - Incomplete 3-star, missing one connection.
<5, (2, \_, \_)> - Incomplete 3-star, missing two connections.
<6, (2, 9, \_)> - Incomplete 3-star, missing one connection.
<7, (1, 3, \_)> - Incomplete 3-star, missing one connection.
<8, (1, 4, \_)> - Incomplete 3-star, missing one connection.
<9, (0, 1, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
