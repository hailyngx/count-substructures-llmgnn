Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in this graph, which are:
<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<1, (0, 8, 3)>
<4, (7, 8, 9)>
<7, (0, 2, 4)>
