Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
    The unique 3-stars found in the graph are <0, (4, 8, 5)>, <1, (2, 7, 6)>, and <6, (2, 5, 9)>.
