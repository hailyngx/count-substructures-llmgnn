Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-star structures in the given graph. Here are the 3-stars found:

<0, (6, 9, 1)>
<7, (1, 9, 5)>
<9, (0, 1, 3)>
<6, (0, 4, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
