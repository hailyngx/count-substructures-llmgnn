Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 2) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph.  
The 3-stars are:  
<1, (8, 9, 4)>  
<3, (4, 8, 9)>  
<4, (3, 8, 9)>  
<9, (1, 3, 8)>  

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
