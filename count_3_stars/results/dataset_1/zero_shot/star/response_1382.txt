Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph: 

<0, (2, 7, 9)>
<1, (2, 5, 9)>
<2, (0, 1, 6)>
<3, (8, 9, 6)>
<5, (1, 6, 7)>
<6, (2, 5, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
