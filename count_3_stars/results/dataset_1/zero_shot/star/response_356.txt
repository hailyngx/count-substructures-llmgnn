Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph can be determined by identifying the central node and the three nodes connected to it. 

First, let's identify the central nodes and their corresponding 3-stars:
1. Central node: 0
   - <0, (3, 5, 6)>
   - <0, (3, 5, 9)>
   - <0, (5, 6, 9)>
   - <0, (3, 6, 9)>

2. Central node: 1
   - <1, (2, 4, 7)>
   
3. Central node: 2
   - <2, (1, 8, 9)>

4. Central node: 3
   - <3, (0, 5, 7)>
   - <3, (0, 7, 9)>
   - <3, (5, 7, 9)>

5. Central node: 4
   - <4, (1, 8, 6)>

6. Central node: 5
   - <5, (0, 3, 9)>

7. Central node: 6
   - <6, (0, 8, 9)>

8. Central node: 7
   - <7, (1, 3, 9)>

9. Central node: 8
   - <8, (2, 4, 6)>

10. Central node: 9
   - <9, (0, 2, 5)>
   - <9, (0, 3, 6)>
   - <9, (0, 5, 6)>
   - <9, (2, 3, 6)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [(4 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4) = 18].
