Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
There are [12] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 4, 8)>
<1, (2, 4, 8)>
<1, (7, 8, 9)>
<2, (1, 3, 9)>
<3, (0, 2, 4)>
<4, (0, 1, 3)>
<4, (6, 1, 8)>
<8, (0, 1, 2)>
<5, (8, 0, 2)>
<9, (1, 2, 8)>
<2, (1, 8, 9)>
<6, (4, 1, 8)>
