Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [6] unique 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (1, 6, 3)>
<1, (0, 4, 7)>
<2, (5, 8, 9)>
<3, (4, 6, 8)>
<4, (1, 3, 5)>
<5, (2, 4, 9)>
