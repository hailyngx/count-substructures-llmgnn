Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
There are [3] 3-stars in the given graph.  
<2, (0, 5, 7)>  
<8, (2, 3, 4)>  
<8, (2, 7, 9)>
