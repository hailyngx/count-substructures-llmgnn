Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in this graph is [2].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<1, (0, 2, 8)>
