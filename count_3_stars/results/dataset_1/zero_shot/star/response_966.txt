Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 0) 

Response:
The given graph contains the following 3-star configurations:

[<0, (1, 4, 5)>, <1, (0, 3, 8)>, <2, (5, 6, 7)>, <3, (1, 4, 7)>, <4, (0, 3, 5)>, <5, (0, 2, 3)>, <6, (2, 7, 5)>, <7, (3, 5, 6)>, <8, (0, 1, None)>, <9, (0, None, None)>]

Therefore, there are 10 3-stars in the given graph. So, the final answer is [10].
