Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 3-stars in this graph. Here are the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (5, 8, 9)>
<1, (2, 3, 6)>
<3, (1, 5, 6)>  
<6, (1, 3, 9)>
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
