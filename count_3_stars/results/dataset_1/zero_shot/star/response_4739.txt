Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
The 3-stars are:
<1, (2, 4, 5)>
<2, (1, 5, 6)>
<3, (5, 7, 8)>
<4, (1, 9, 5)>

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
