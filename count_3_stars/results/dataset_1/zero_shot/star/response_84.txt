Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 3 unique 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (5, 6, 7)>
<1, (3, 4, 8)>
<3, (1, 6, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
