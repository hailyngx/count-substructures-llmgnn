Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph.  

The unique 3-stars are:  
<0, (3, 5, 6)>  
<0, (3, 6, 8)>  
<0, (5, 6, 8)>  
<2, (4, 6, 9)>  
<4, (1, 2, 6)>  
<4, (2, 6, 8)>
