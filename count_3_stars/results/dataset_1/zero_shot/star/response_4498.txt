Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 2) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:
[<1, (5, 6, 0)>, <2, (3, 8, 9)>, <3, (2, 5, 0)>, <4, (6, 0, 0)>, <5, (1, 3, 7)>, <6, (1, 4, 8)>, <7, (5, 0, 0)>, <8, (2, 6, 0)>, <9, (2, 0, 0)>]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
