Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
The graph contains only one 3-star, which is represented by the following set:
\[ <3, (0, 1, 8)> \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1].
