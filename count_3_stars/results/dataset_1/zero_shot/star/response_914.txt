Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 4) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 6, 1)>
<1, (4, 5, 7)>
<2, (0, 3, 4)>
<4, (1, 2, 3)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4].
