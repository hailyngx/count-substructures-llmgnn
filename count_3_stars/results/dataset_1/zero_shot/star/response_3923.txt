Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:

[<0, (2, 7, 1)>, <1, (2, 3, 5)>, <2, (0, 1, 3)>, <3, (1, 2, 6)>, <5, (1, 7, -)>, <7, (0, 5, 8)>, <8, (2, 3, 7)>]

Therefore, there are 7 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The answer is [7].
