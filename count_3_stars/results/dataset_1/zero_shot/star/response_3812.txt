Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<1, (0, 5, 9)>
