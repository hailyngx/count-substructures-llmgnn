Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [3] 3-stars in the given graph.  

<0, (3, 4, 6)>  
<2, (1, 4, 6)>  
<6, (0, 7, 8)>
