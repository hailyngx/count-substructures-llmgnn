Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The answer is [4].
  
The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (2, 6, 8)>
<2, (1, 4, 5)>
<3, (6, 8, 9)>
<7, (2, 8, 9)>
