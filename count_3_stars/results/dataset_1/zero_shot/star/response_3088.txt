Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (5, 8, 9)>
<2, (1, 5, 6)>
<2, (5, 6, 9)>
<8, (0, 3, 7)>
<8, (3, 7, 9)>
<8, (0, 5, 9)>
<9, (0, 2, 8)>
<9, (2, 8, 9)>
