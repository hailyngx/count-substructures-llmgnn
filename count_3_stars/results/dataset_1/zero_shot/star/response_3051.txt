Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of nodes in the graph is 10. From the given edges, we can identify the 3-stars:

1. <0, (3, 9, 2)>
2. <1, (5, 6, 8)>
3. <2, (3, 5, 8)>
4. <3, (0, 2, 6)>
5. <5, (1, 2, 4)>
6. <6, (1, 3, 5)>
7. <8, (1, 2, _)> (No third node connected to node 8)
8. <9, (0, 3, 6)>

Since each 3-star is unique, there are 8 3-stars in total. Hence, the answer is [8].
