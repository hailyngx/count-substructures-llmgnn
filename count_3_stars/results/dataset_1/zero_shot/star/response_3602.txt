Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 6) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The 3-stars are:
<1, (6, 7, 9)>
<6, (1, 3, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
