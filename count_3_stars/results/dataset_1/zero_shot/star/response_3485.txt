Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [2] 3-stars in the given graph.  

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (4, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 3, 6)>
