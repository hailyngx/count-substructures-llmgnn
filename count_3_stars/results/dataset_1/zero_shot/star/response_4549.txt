Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in this graph.  
The 3-stars are:  
<0, (1, 5, 6)>  
<1, (0, 6, 8)>  
<3, (1, 6, 5)>  
<4, (1, 2, 3)>  
<5, (0, 3, 6)>  
<6, (0, 1, 7)>  

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
