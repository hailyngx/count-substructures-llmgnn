Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

The 3-stars are:
<1, (0, 2, 5)>
<7, (3, 5, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
