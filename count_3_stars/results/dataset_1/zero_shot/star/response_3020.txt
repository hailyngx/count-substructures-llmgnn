Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [8] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 4, 7)>
<1, (4, 5, 7)>
<2, (0, 3, 7)>
<3, (2, 7, 9)>
<4, (0, 1, 5)>
<5, (1, 4, 7)>
<7, (0, 1, 2)>
<8, (0, 4, 5)>
