Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph can be determined by finding all occurrences where a node has exactly 3 edges connected to it (excluding self-loops). Based on the given information, we can identify the following 3-stars:

<0, (6, 8, -)>
<1, (3, 5, -)>
<2, (8, - , -)>
<3, (1, 4, 5)>
<4, (3, 5, -)>
<5, (1, 3, 4)>
<6, (0, 3, 5)>
<7, (3, 4, -)>
<8, (0, 2, 3)>
<9, (5, 8, -)>

Thus, there are a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
