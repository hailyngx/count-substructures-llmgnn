Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are:
- <0, (2, 8, 9)>
- <1, (3, 5, 6)>
- <3, (1, 4, 6)>
- <4, (3, 6, 8)>
- <5, (1, 7, 9)>
- <6, (1, 3, 4)>
- <7, (4, 5, 6)>
- <8, (0, 1, 3)>
- <9, (0, 1, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
