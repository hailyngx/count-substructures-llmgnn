Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are a total of 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are listed:

1. <0, (2, 6, 0)>
2. <1, (3, 5, 1)>
3. <2, (0, 4, 7)>
4. <3, (1, 6, 7)>
5. <4, (2, 7, 8)>
6. <5, (1, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [6].
