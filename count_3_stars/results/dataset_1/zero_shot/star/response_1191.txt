Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:
[<0, (2, 4, 9)>, <2, (0, 8, 9)>, <3, (7, 8, 9)>, <4, (0, 5, 6)>, <6, (4, 8, 9)>, <7, (3, 8, 9)>, <8, (2, 3, 6)>, <9, (0, 1, 6)>]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
