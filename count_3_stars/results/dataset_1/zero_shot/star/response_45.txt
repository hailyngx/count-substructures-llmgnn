Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (7, 9, 1)>
<1, (5, 6, 9)>
<4, (2, 8, 7)>
