Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
The total number of 3-star graphs can be calculated by counting the number of ways we can choose a central node (denoted by C) and then selecting 3 adjacent nodes to form a 3-star.

Let's analyze the given graph to count the number of 3-stars.

From the provided edges, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (3, 4, 8)>
<1, (3, 6, 8)>
<2, (4, 7, 9)>
<3, (0, 1, 4)>
<4, (0, 2, 9)>
<6, (1, 8)>
<8, (0, 1, 6)>
<9, (0, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8] as shown below:
<0, (3, 4, 8)>, <1, (3, 6, 8)>, <2, (4, 7, 9)>, <3, (0, 1, 4)>, <4, (0, 2, 9)>, <6, (1, 8)>, <8, (0, 1, 6)>, <9, (0, 4)>
