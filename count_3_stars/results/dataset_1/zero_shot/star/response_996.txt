Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are <0, (2, 8, 9)>, <2, (0, 8, 9)>, <4, (7, 8, 9)>, <6, (3, 5, 8)>, <7, (4, 8, 9)>, <9, (1, 2, 4)>.
