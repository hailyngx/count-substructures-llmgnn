Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 6, 2)>
<1, (0, 6, 2)>
<1, (4, 6, 7)>
<1, (2, 3, 4)>
