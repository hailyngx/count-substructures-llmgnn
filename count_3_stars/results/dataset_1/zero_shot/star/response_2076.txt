Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.
    
<0, (4, 5, 7)>
<1, (2, 7, 8)>
<2, (1, 4, 6)>
<7, (1, 3, 9)>
