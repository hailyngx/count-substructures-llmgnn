Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (3, 9, 1)>
<1, (5, 8, 9)>
<1, (7, 8, 4)>
<1, (9, 0, 5)>
<4, (6, 7, 9)>
<8, (3, 5, 1)>
<9, (0, 1, 4)>
<9, (4, 1, 0)>
