Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 6.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 6, and 7.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 5, and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0 and 5.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 5.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1 and 5.
- Node 8 is connected to node 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 8.

Let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph:
- From node 0: <0, (2, 4, 6)>
- From node 1: <1, (2, 3, 6)>
- From node 2: <2, (0, 1, 5)>
- From node 3: <3, (1, 5, 9)>
- From node 5: <5, (2, 3, 6)> and <5, (2, 4, 7)>
- From node 9: <9, (2, 3, 8)>

Therefore, there are a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
