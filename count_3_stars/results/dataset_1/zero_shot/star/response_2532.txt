Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be found by counting all possible 3-stars based on the central node. 

First, let's identify the nodes and their corresponding edges:
- Node 0 is connected to 1, 2, 6, 8, and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to 0 and 2.
- Node 2 is connected to 0, 1, 4, and 6.
- Node 3 is connected to 5 and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to 2, 7, 8, and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to 3 and 6.
- Node 6 is connected to 0, 2, and 5.
- Node 7 is connected to 4, 8, and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to 0, 3, 4, and 7.
- Node 9 is connected to 0, 4, and 7.

Now, let's list all the 3-stars based on the central node:
<0, (1, 2, 6)>
<0, (1, 8, 9)>
<2, (0, 1, 6)>
<2, (0, 4, 6)>
<2, (1, 4, 6)>
<4, (2, 7, 8)>
<4, (2, 7, 9)>
<4, (7, 8, 9)>
<6, (0, 2, 5)>
<8, (0, 3, 4)>
<8, (0, 7, 9)>
<8, (3, 4, 7)>
<9, (0, 7, 4)>
<9, (0, 7, 9)>
<9, (4, 7, 8)>

Counting these unique 3-stars, we get a total of [15] 3-stars in the given graph.
