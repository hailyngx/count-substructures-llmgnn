Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is 4.  

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 7, 9)>
<1, (4, 5, 9)>
<2, (6, 7, 2)>
<9, (8, 5, 1)>  

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
