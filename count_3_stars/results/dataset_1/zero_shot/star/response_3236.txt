Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 5) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be found by counting the total number of instances where a node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes. Let's calculate this:

Let node 0 be the center of the 3-star:
- <0, (1, 2, 5)>
- Number of 3-stars = 1

Let node 1 be the center of the 3-star:
- <1, (0, 2, 6)>
- <1, (2, 6, 7)>
- Number of 3-stars = 2

Let node 2 be the center of the 3-star:
- <2, (0, 1, 5)>
- <2, (1, 4, 5)>
- Number of 3-stars = 2

Let node 4 be the center of the 3-star:
- <4, (2, 5, 8)>
- Number of 3-stars = 1

Let node 5 be the center of the 3-star:
- <5, (0, 2, 6)>
- Number of 3-stars = 1

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7]. The unique 3-stars are <0, (1, 2, 5)>, <1, (0, 2, 6)>, <1, (2, 6, 7)>, <2, (0, 1, 5)>, <2, (1, 4, 5)>, <4, (2, 5, 8)>, <5, (0, 2, 6)>.
