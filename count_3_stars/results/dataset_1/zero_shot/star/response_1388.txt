Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are 4 total 3-stars in this graph.

<[1, (3, 5, 4)]>
<[4, (1, 2, 9)]>
<[5, (1, 3, 4)]>
<[7, (0, 6, 6)]> 

So, the answer is [4].
