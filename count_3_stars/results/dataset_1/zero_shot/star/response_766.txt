Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are <0, (1, 3, 4)>, <1, (0, 6, 7)>, <3, (0, 4, 6)>, <4, (0, 3, 9)>, <6, (1, 3, 7)>, <8, (1, 2, 9)>.

Therefore, there are [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
