Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [2] 3-stars in the given graph. 
The unique 3-stars are <3, (4, 7, 8)> and <7, (1, 2, 4)>.
