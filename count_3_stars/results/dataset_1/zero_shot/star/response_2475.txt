Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph.  

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (5, 7, 9)>
<2, (3, 4, 5)>
<2, (4, 5, 7)>
<3, (2, 4, 7)>
<4, (2, 3, 5)>
<4, (5, 6, 7)>
