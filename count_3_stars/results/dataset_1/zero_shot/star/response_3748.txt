Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Each star is listed below:

<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<1, (0, 5, 8)>
<1, (3, 4, 9)>
<5, (0, 1, 2)>
<5, (6, 8, 1)>
<8, (1, 4, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
