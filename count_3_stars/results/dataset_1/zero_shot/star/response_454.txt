Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 46 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be counted by looking at nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list out the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<2, (1, 3, 5)>
<3, (0, 2, 4)>
<4, (1, 3, 8)>
<5, (0, 2, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
