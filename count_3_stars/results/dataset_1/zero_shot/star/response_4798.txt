Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be determined by counting the occurrences of nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

Counting from the list of edges provided, we find the following 3-stars with their corresponding center nodes and leaf nodes:
   - <0, (3, 4, 9)>
   - <2, (4, 9, 3)>
   - <3, (0, 4, 8)>
   - <4, (0, 2, 3)>
   - <5, (8, 9, 3)>
   - <6, (1, 8, -)>
   - <8, (3, 5, 6)>
   - <9, (2, 3, 4)>

Therefore, there are a total of [8] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
