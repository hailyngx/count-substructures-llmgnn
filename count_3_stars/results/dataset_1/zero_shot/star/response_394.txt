Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are:
[3]

There is only one 3-star in the given graph. It has the central node 3 connected to the leaf nodes 2, 8, and 9.

Therefore, the final answer is [1].
