Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<2, (0, 1, 5)>
<3, (0, 7, 9)>
<5, (2, 4, 6)>
