Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) 

Response:
There are 3-stars in the given graph:

[<0, (3, 7, 8)>, <2, (3, 4, 5)>]
