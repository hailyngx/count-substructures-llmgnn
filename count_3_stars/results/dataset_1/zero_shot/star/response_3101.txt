Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:

[<0, (3, 4, 5)>, <1, (2, 8, 9)>, <2, (1, 6, 7)>, <3, (0, 4, 6)>, <4, (0, 3, 8)>, <7, (0, 2, 8)>] 

Therefore, there are 6 unique 3-stars in total. So, the final answer is [6].
