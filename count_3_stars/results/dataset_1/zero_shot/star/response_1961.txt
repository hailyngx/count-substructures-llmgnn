Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
    
    <0, (5, 9)>
    <1, (3, 4, 6)>
    <3, (1, 4, 5)>
    <4, (1, 3, 5)>
    <5, (0, 3, 4)>
