Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are 4 three-star graphs in the given input. Here they are listed uniquely inside angle brackets <>:
  
<2, (5, 8, 6)>
<3, (4, 6, 9)>
<4, (3, 7, 9)>
<8, (2, 6, 7)>
  
Therefore, the final answer is: [4].
