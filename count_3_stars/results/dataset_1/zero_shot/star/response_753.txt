Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 8, 9)>
<1, (2, 6, 7)>
<2, (1, 7, 9)>
<3, (0, 4, 5)>
<4, (1, 3, 6)>
<5, (3, 7, 9)>
<7, (2, 5, 8)>
<9, (2, 4, 8)>
