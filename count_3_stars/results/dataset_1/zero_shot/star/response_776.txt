Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph can be calculated by counting the number of nodes having exactly 3 outgoing edges. Here are the calculations:

- Node 0 has 3 outgoing edges (0, 4), (0, 6), (0, 9).
- Node 1 has 1 outgoing edge (1, 2).
- Node 2 has 4 outgoing edges (2, 1), (2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 8).
- Node 3 has 3 outgoing edges (3, 5), (3, 7), (3, 8).
- Node 4 has 3 outgoing edges (4, 6), (4, 7), (4, 8).
- Node 5 has 3 outgoing edges (5, 3), (5, 8), (5, 9).
- Node 6 has 4 outgoing edges (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 7).
- Node 7 has 5 outgoing edges (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 6), (7, 9).
- Node 8 has 4 outgoing edges (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 5).
- Node 9 has 3 outgoing edges (9, 0), (9, 5), (9, 7).

Therefore, we have 4 3-stars in the given graph, and they are as follows:
<0, (4, 6, 9)>
<2, (1, 6, 7)>
<3, (5, 7, 8)>
<4, (6, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the final count of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
