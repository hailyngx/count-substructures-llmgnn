Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) 

Response:
There are [2] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (6, 8, -)>
<1, (3, 4, 8)>
