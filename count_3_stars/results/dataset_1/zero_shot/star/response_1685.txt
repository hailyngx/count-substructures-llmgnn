Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are [3] 3-stars in the given graph. The unique 3-stars are:

<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<1, (2, 4, 5)>
<2, (0, 1, 4)>
