Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph: 
<0, (1, 7, 9)>
<1, (0, 5, 5)>
<3, (6, 8, 8)>
<5, (1, 6, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
