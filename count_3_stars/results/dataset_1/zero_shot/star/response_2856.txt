Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 6) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph. 

Unique 3-stars: 
<0, (1, 8, 9)>
<1, (0, 2, 8)>
<2, (1, 5, 9)>
<4, (6, 8, 9)>
<5, (2, 9, 5)>
<6, (0, 3, 4)>
