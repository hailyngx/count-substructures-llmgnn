Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The number of 3-stars is [6].
