Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are <0, (1, 7, 4)> and <1, (0, 6, 9)> as the two unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
