Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are [5] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (4, 8, -)>
<1, (2, 5, -)>
<2, (1, 4, 6)>
<4, (0, 2, 5)>
<6, (2, 5, 9)>
