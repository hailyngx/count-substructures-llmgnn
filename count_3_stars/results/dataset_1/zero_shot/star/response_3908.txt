Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The 3-stars are as follows: 
<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<1, (0, 3, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
