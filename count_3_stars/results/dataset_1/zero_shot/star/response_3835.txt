Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

Unique 3-stars:
<2, (3, 8, 9)>
<3, (2, 8, 9)>
<5, (6, 7, 9)>
