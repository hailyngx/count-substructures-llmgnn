Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph has 3-star structures with the following central nodes and leaves:

<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<2, (0, 7, 9)>
<3, (0, 4, 6)>
<5, (6, 7, 8)>
<7, (2, 5, 9)>
<9, (0, 4, 7)>

There are a total of [6] 3-stars in the graph.
