Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 6) 

Response:
There are a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (6, 5, 8)>
<3, (8, 6, 4)>
<4, (5, 7, 6)>
<5, (4, 7, 6)>
<6, (0, 5, 8)>
<8, (3, 6, 4)>
