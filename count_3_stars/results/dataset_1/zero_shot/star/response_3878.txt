Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
    
    The unique 3-stars found are:
    <0, (3, 8, 9)>
    <2, (3, 6, 9)>
    <4, (3, 6, 7)>
