Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<3, (1, 4, 6)>
<4, (3, 9, 1)>
<5, (0, 7, 1)>
<7, (0, 1, 5)>
