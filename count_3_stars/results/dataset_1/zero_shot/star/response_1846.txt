Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

The 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<2, (0, 4, 6)>
<4, (0, 2, 9)>
<6, (2, 3, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
