Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 5) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in this graph can be found by counting the number of unique paths consisting of a central node and three leaf nodes.

We can identify the 3-stars in the given graph by examining each node and its connected edges. The 3-stars that can be formed in this graph are as follows:
<0, (4, 7, 0)>
<3, (1, 6, 3)>
<4, (6, 7, 4)>
<7, (0, 6, 7)>
<8, (4, 5, 8)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we find that there are a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
