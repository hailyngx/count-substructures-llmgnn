Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (8, 1, 2)>
<1, (4, 2, 8)>
<2, (4, 8, 1)>
<3, (5, 9, 6)>
<5, (3, 9, 6)>
<7, (6, 8, 7)>
