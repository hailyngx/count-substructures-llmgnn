Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-star graphs in the given graph can be found by counting the number of nodes that act as the center of a 3-star. Since a 3-star consists of a center connected to exactly three other nodes, we need to find nodes in the graph that have exactly three neighbors.

By examining the given edges and their connections, we can identify the nodes with three neighbors:
- Node 0: neighbors 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9
- Node 3: neighbors 0, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
- Node 4: neighbors 1, 3, 5, 7
- Node 5: neighbors 0, 3, 4
- Node 7: neighbors 0, 3, 4, 8, 9
- Node 8: neighbors 0, 3, 7, 9
- Node 9: neighbors 0, 1, 6, 7, 8

We can see that the nodes 0, 3, and 7 are centers of 3-star graphs. Now let's list the unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<3, (4, 5, 7)>
<7, (4, 8, 9)>

Count of 3-star graphs: [3]
