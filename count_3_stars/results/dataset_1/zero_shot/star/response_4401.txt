Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are:

<0, (3, 4, 8)>
<2, (1, 3, 4)>
<3, (0, 2, 4)>
<4, (0, 3, 8)>
<5, (4, 7, 9)>
<9, (4, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
