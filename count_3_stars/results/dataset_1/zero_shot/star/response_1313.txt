Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
    
    <0, (1, 7, 8)>
    <1, (0, 3, 6)>
    <2, (4, 5, 8)>
    <3, (1, 2, 5)>
    <4, (2, 5, 9)>
    <5, (2, 3, 6)>
    <6, (1, 5, 7)>
    <9, (1, 2, 6)>
