Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are 4 different 3-stars in the given graph. Here is the list of unique 3-stars:

<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<1, (0, 3, 6)>
<2, (3, 6, 8)>
<3, (1, 2, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
