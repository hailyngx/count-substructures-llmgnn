Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (6, 7, 8)>
<1, (4, 6, 9)>
<2, (6, 7, 0)>
<3, (4, 7, 0)>
