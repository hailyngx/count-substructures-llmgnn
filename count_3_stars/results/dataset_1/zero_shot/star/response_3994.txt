Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (2, 6) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are 3 unique 3-stars in the given graph: <0, (6, 9, 2)>, <5, (6, 8, 9)>, <9, (0, 3, 6)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
