Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph: [6]
    
    Unique 3-stars:
    <0, (2, 3, 4)>
    <2, (0, 3, 4)>
    <4, (2, 5, 6)>
    <5, (4, 7, 9)>
    <6, (4, 8, 7)>
    <7, (3, 5, 9)>
