Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph. The unique 3-stars are <0, (5, 9, 4)>, <2, (3, 8, 9)>, <4, (5, 7, 9)>, and <8, (5, 7, 2)>.
