Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are:

1. <0, (4, 5, 8)>
2. <1, (2, 4, 6)>
3. <2, (7, 6, 8)>
4. <3, (4, 7, 9)> 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
