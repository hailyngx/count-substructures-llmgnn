Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 2) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is: [6]

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (2, 6, 7)>
<2, (1, 4, 5)>
<2, (5, 7, 9)>
<6, (1, 3, 8)>
<7, (0, 2, 8)>
<8, (6, 7, 8)>
