Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.  
The unique 3-stars are:  
<0, (3, 4, 9)>  
<1, (5, 6, -)>  
<2, (5, 8, 9)>  
<5, (1, 2, 7)>
