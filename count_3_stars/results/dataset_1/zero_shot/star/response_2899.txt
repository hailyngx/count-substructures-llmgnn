Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be calculated by counting the number of 3-stars that can be formed considering each node as the center. 

By examining the given edges, we can find all the 3-stars in the graph:

1. <0, (3, 4, 1)>
2. <1, (2, 4, 7)>
3. <2, (1, 7, 8)>
4. <3, (0, 5, 9)>
5. <4, (0, 1, 7)>
6. <5, (3, 8, -)>
7. <6, (2, 9, -)>
8. <7, (1, 2, -)>
9. <8, (2, 5, -)>
10. <9, (3, 6, -)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
