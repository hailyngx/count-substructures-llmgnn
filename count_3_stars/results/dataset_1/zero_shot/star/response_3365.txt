Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 9) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are two 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 4, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
