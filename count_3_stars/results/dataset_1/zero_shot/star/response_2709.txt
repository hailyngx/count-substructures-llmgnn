Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 5) (9, 2) 

Response:
There are [7] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 7, 2)>
<1, (0, 2, 4)>
<2, (1, 4, 7)>
<4, (1, 2, 5)>
<5, (4, 6, 8)>
<6, (4, 5, 7)>
<7, (0, 2, 6)>
