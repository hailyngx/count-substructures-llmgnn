Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars in the graph are:
<0, (3, 6, 7)>
<1, (3, 4, 5)>
<3, (0, 1, 4)>
<6, (0, 7, 9)>
