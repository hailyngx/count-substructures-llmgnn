Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:
[<0, (2, 8, 7)>, <1, (3, 4, 6)>, <3, (1, 5, 9)>, <4, (1, 3, 6)>, <5, (3, 6, 9)>, <6, (3, 4, 5)>, <7, (4, 5, 8)>] 

Therefore, there are 7 unique 3-stars in the graph. So, the final answer is [7].
