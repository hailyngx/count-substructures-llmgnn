Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be determined by counting all the possible combinations of central node and leaves. Let's compute that below:

Given the edges:
- Node 1: (2, 3, 7, 8, 9)
- Node 2: (1)
- Node 3: (1, 5, 9)
- Node 4: (8)
- Node 5: (3, 7)
- Node 6: (7)
- Node 7: (1, 5, 6, 8, 9)
- Node 8: (1, 4, 7, 9)
- Node 9: (1, 3, 7, 8)

We can form 3-stars from the following unique combinations:
<1, (2, 7, 8)>
<1, (3, 7, 9)>
<1, (7, 8, 9)>
<3, (1, 5, 9)>
<5, (3, 7)>
<7, (1, 5, 6)>
<7, (1, 8, 9)>
<7, (5, 8, 9)>
<8, (1, 4, 9)>
<9, (1, 3, 7)>

Counting these unique 3-stars, we get a total of [10] distinct 3-stars in the given graph.
