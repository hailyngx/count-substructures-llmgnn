Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in this graph. Here they are:
<0, (4, 9, 3)>
<1, (3, 5, 0)>
<4, (9, 0, 5)>
<5, (1, 4, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [4].
