Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 2 unique 3-stars in this graph. 

The 3-stars are:
<2, (4, 6, 9)>
<6, (2, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
