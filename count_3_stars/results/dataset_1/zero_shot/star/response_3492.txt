Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 4, 7)>
<2, (0, 3, 4)>
<4, (0, 2, 7)>
<7, (0, 4, 5)>
<5, (1, 7, 9)>
<9, (2, 3, 4)>
