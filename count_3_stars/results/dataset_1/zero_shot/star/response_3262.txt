Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

The 3-stars are:
<5, (3, 6, 7)>
<7, (1, 5, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
