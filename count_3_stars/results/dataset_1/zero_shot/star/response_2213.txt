Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph. Here are the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (1, 6, 5)>
<1, (0, 8, 5)>
<2, (3, 7, 5)>
<3, (2, 9, 7)>
<4, (5, 9, 7)>
<9, (3, 4, 6)>
