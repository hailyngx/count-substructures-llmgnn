Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (6, 7, 8)>
<0, (6, 8, 9)>
<0, (7, 8, 9)>
<3, (6, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 3, 4)>
<8, (0, 3, 9)>
<8, (0, 4, 9)>
<8, (3, 4, 9)>
<9, (0, 8, 5)>
<9, (0, 8, 9)>
<9, (5, 7, 8)>
<9, (8, 5, 7)>
