Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are a total of 8 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here is the list of unique 3-stars:

<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<1, (0, 2, 5)>
<2, (0, 1, 6)>
<3, (4, 7, *)>
<4, (0, 3, 8)>
<5, (1, 2, 7)>
<6, (1, 2, 9)>
<7, (3, 5, *)>

Therefore, the final answer is [8].
