Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are three 3-stars in the given graph.  

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (5, 7, 8)>
<3, (1, 4, 9)>
<6, (2, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
