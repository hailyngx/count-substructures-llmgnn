Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph can be found by examining each node and its neighbors to see if they form a 3-star. 

Examining each node:
- Node 0: <0, (5, 6, 9)>
- Node 1: <1, (6, 7, 9)>
- Node 2: <2, (6, 8, _)>
- Node 3: <3, (4, 5, 6)>
- Node 4: <4, (3, 6, 8)>
- Node 5: <5, (0, 3, 6)>
- Node 6: <6, (0, 1, 2)>
- Node 7: <7, (1, 8, _)>
- Node 8: <8, (2, 4, 5)>
- Node 9: <9, (0, 1, _)>

Count of 3-stars in the graph: [9]
