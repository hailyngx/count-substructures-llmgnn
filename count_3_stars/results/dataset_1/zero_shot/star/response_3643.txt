Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 3 3-stars in this graph. Here they are: 

<1, (2, 7, 8)>
<4, (3, 6, 7)>
<6, (5, 4, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
