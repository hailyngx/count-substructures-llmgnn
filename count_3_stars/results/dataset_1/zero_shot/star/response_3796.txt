Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph can be visualized as follows:

```
    0 -- 1 -- 7
   / \   |
  2   3 5
     / \ |
    6 -- 8
         |
         9
```

The total number of 3-stars in this graph can be found by counting the number of unique 3-star configurations.

Now, let's find all the 3-star configurations in this graph:

1. <0, (1, 2, 3)>
2. <1, (0, 5, 7)>
3. <2, (0, 3, 6)>
4. <3, (1, 2, 6)>
5. <5, (1, 7, 0)>
6. <6, (2, 3, 8)>
7. <7, (1, 5, 8)>
8. <8, (6, 7, 9)>
9. <9, (8)>

Counting all the unique 3-stars above, we can see that there are 9 in total, thus the final answer is [9].
