Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The central nodes of the 3-stars can be identified by checking which nodes are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

From the given edges, we can see that the central nodes are 2, 8, and 9. 

Now, let's identify the leaves for each central node:

- Central node 2: Leaves are 0, 6, and 7. <2, (0, 6, 7)>
- Central node 8: Leaves are 1, 4, and 6. <8, (1, 4, 6)>
- Central node 9: Leaves are 3, 4, and 8. <9, (3, 4, 8)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3]. <2, (0, 6, 7)>, <8, (1, 4, 6)>, <9, (3, 4, 8)>.
