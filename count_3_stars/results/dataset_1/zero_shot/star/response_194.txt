Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph. 
The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<1, (2, 4, 8)>
<2, (1, 5, 7)>
<4, (1, 3, 8)>
<4, (5, 6, 8)>
