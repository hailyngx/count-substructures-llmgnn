Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The count of 3-stars is as follows:

\[2\] 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 7, 8)>
<6, (2, 7, 9)>
