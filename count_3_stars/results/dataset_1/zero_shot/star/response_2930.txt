Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are <0, (3, 4, 5)>, <2, (4, 5, 6)>, and <2, (4, 5, 8)> 3-stars in this graph. So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
