Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<2, (7, 9, 8)>
<3, (4, 6, 9)>
<6, (3, 9, 2)>
<9, (2, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
