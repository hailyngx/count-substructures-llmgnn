Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (4, 5, 6)>
<2, (0, 6, 4)>
<3, (1, 5, 9)>
<4, (1, 6, 8)>
<5, (1, 6, 9)>
<6, (4, 6, 8)>
