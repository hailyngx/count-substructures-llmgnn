Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
  
The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<3, (1, 2, 5)>
<5, (0, 3, 4)>
<5, (0, 3, 9)>
<9, (0, 5, 9)>
<2, (3, 1, 3)>
<4, (0, 5, 4)>
<1, (3, 2, 3)>
