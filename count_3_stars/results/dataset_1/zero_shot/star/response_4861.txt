Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
The total number of 3-star structures in the given graph can be calculated by counting the number of occurrences of the center node and its three leaves.

Here is the solution to your query:

The unique 3-star structures in the given graph are <2, (3, 5, 6)> and <8, (1, 3, 7)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-star structures in the given graph is [2].
