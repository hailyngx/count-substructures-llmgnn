Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 5, 8)>
<1, (6, 7, 0)>
<3, (6, 7, 9)>
<4, (6, 7, 9)>
<6, (1, 3, 4)>
<9, (3, 4, 8)>
