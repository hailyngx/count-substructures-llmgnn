Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:
[<0, (5, 2, 1)>, <3, (5, 8, 1)>, <4, (8, 1, 9)>, <6, (2, 1, 5)>, <7, (5, 3, 8)>]
The total number of 3-stars in this graph is [5].
