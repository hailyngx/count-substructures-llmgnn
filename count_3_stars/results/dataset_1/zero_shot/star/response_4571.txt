Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:
[<0, (3, 9, 2)>, <1, (4, 5, 9)>, <3, (0, 2, 5)>, <4, (1, 9, 5)>, <2, (3, 8, 0)>, <5, (1, 3, 9)>]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
