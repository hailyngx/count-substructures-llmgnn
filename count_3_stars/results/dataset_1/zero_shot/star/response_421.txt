Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (1, 4, 7)>
- <3, (1, 7, 9)>
- <7, (0, 3, 4)>
