Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (4, 2, 6)>
<1, (6, 4, 9)>
<2, (4, 0, 8)>
<4, (0, 2, 6)>
<5, (8, 7, 4)>
<7, (8, 5, 4)>
