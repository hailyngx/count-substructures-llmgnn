Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are:
<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<0, (5, 6, 8)>
<3, (0, 5, 7)>
<5, (3, 4, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [4].
