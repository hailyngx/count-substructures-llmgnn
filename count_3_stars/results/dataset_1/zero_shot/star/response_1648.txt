Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (5, 3) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph. Here are the unique 3-stars:
<1, (2, 0, 8)>
<1, (3, 9, 8)>
<3, (1, 5, 9)>
<9, (1, 8, 6)>
