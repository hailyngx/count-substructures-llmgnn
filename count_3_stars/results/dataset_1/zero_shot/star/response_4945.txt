Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
There is <0, (6, 7, 8)> 3-star in the given graph.
   
   There is <1, (6, 9, 0)> 3-star in the given graph.
   
   There is <2, (8, 0, 0)> 3-star in the given graph.
   
   There is <3, (7, 9, 0)> 3-star in the given graph.
   
   There is <4, (9, 6, 5)> 3-star in the given graph.
   
   There is <5, (6, 7, 6)> 3-star in the given graph.
   
   There is <6, (0, 1, 5)> 3-star in the given graph.
   
   There is <7, (0, 3, 7)> 3-star in the given graph.
   
   There is <8, (0, 2, 8)> 3-star in the given graph.
   
   There is <9, (1, 4, 3)> 3-star in the given graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [10].
