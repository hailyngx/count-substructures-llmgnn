Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (4, 2) (5, 1) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph:  
<1, (5, 7, 9)>  
<2, (4, 8, 9)>  

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
