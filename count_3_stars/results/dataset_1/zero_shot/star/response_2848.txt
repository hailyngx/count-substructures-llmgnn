Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (8, 5, 1)>
<1, (2, 5, 0)>
<2, (1, 5, 0)>
<5, (1, 2, 6)>
<7, (9, 5, 6)>
