Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. To find the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to look for each node that has exactly 3 edges. These nodes will be the centers of 3-stars.

Based on the provided edge list, we can identify the following 3-star structures:
1. <0, (2, 3, 6)>
2. <0, (2, 3, 7)>
3. <0, (2, 3, 8)>
4. <0, (2, 7, 9)>
5. <0, (3, 7, 8)>

Therefore, there are [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
