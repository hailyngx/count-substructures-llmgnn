Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.  
The unique 3-stars are <0, (1, 3, 8)>, <2, (3, 5, 8)>, <4, (5, 9, 7)>, and <6, (1, 8, 6)>.
