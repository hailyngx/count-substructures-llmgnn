Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (7, 3) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are as follows:
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<1, (0, 5, 9)>
<2, (0, 9, 3)>
<3, (0, 5, 7)>
<5, (0, 1, 3)>
<9, (1, 2, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
