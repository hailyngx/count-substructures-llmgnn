Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [2] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (2, 4, 7)>
<8, (0, 9, 6)>
