Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The given graph contains the following 3-stars:
[<0, (4, 6, 1)>, <3, (4, 6, 9)>, <4, (0, 1, 3)>, <6, (0, 1, 3)>, <8, (4, 6, 7)>]
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
