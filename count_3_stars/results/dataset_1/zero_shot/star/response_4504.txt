Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph contains the following 3-stars:
[<0, (1, 4, 6)>, <1, (0, 2, 5)>, <4, (0, 2, 6)>, <5, (1, 2, 6)>, <6, (1, 4, 5)>]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
