Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here are the unique 3-stars found:
    
    1. <0, (1, 8, 9)>
    2. <1, (0, 3, 6)>
    3. <2, (0, 3, 5)>
    4. <3, (1, 2, 4)>
    
The final answer is [4].
