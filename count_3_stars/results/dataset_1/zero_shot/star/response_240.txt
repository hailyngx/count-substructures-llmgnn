Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:
[<0, (5, 7, 3)>, <2, (1, 4, 8)>, <4, (2, 8, 9)>, <8, (2, 4, 7)>] 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
