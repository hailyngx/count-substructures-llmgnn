Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here are the 3-stars listed: 

<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<6, (1, 5, 9)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
