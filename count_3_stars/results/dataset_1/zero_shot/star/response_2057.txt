Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 3, 5)>
<2, (0, 6, 8)>
<3, (0, 5, 8)>
<4, (6, 8, 9)>
