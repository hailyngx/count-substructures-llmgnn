Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are [5] 3-stars in the given graph.

<0, (5, 9, 6)>
<3, (7, 8, 6)>
<4, (6, 9, 5)>
<5, (0, 7, 6)>
<6, (1, 8, 4)>
