Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are a total of [7] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<0, (2, 6, 9)>
<0, (3, 7, 9)>
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<2, (0, 3, 4)>
<2, (0, 6, 9)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
