Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [5] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (2, 6, 9)>
<2, (1, 8, 9)>
<4, (5, 7, 6)>
<5, (4, 6, 7)>
<8, (9, 2, 3)>
