Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (2, 5, 8)>
<3, (1, 5, 9)>
<4, (5, 1, 6)>
<7, (0, 1, 7)>
