Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 4) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (4, 5, 2)>
<1, (3, 6, 7)>
<3, (1, 6, 8)>
<4, (0, 2, 8)>
