Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The provided graph contains the following 3-stars:
[<0, (6, 7, 9)>, <1, (2, 4, 6)>] 
Thus, there are 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
Therefore, the final answer is [2].
