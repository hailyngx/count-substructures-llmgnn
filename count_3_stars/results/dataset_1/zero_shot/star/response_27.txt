Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:
[<0, (1, 6, 0)>, <1, (0, 4, 8)>, <1, (0, 8, 9)>, <2, (3, 5, 6)>, <2, (5, 9, 2)>, <3, (2, 4, 3)>, <4, (1, 3, 8)>, <5, (2, 6, 9)>, <6, (0, 2, 8)>, <9, (1, 2, 5)>]
