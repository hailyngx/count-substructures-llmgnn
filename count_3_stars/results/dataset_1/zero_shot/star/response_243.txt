Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (4, 6, 7)>
<3, (6, 7, 9)>
