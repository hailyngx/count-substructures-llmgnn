Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 10 nodes and 38 edges given. Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph.

The 3-star structures can be represented as follows:

<0, (6, 8, 1)>
<1, (4, 6, 0)>
<2, (5, 7, 3)>
<3, (5, 7, 9)>
<4, (1, 5, 8)>
<5, (2, 3, 6)>
<6, (0, 1, 3)>
<7, (2, 3, 5)>
<8, (0, 4, 6)>
<9, (3, 5, 7)>

Therefore, there are a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
