Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 6, 7)>
<1, (5, 8, 9)>
<2, (0, 5, 6)>
<5, (1, 2, 4)>
