Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 8) (7, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.

<1, (2, 4, 7)>
<1, (4, 2, 9)>
<1, (7, 1, 9)>
<9, (2, 4, 8)>
