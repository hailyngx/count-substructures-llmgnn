Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
The central nodes of the 3-stars can be identified by finding nodes with exactly 3 edges incident on them. Here, the nodes that have exactly 3 incident edges are 1, 2, 3, and 8. 

1. <1, (0, 6, 8)>
2. <2, (0, 5, 6)>
3. <3, (6, 8, 9)>
4. <8, (1, 3, 7)>

Therefore, there are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The final answer is [4].
