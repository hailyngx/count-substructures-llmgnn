Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 6 3-stars in the given graph. The unique 3-stars are: <0, (1, 3, 5)>, <1, (0, 4, 5)>, <1, (4, 6, 7)>, <1, (5, 7, 8)>, <7, (1, 2, 9)>, <9, (2, 7, 8)>.  
Therefore, the final answer is [6].
