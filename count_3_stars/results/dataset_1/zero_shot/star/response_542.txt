Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph.  

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<0, (4, 6, 9)>
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<3, (0, 2, 9)>
<4, (2, 5, 6)>
<8, (1, 3, 7)>
