Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 4, 7)>
<3, (2, 6, 9)>
<7, (0, 2, 9)>
<8, (2, 5, 7)>
<9, (0, 5, 6)>
<2, (3, 7, 8)>
