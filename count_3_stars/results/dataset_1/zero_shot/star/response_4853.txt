Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in this graph. Here they are:
<0, (6, 7, 1)>
<1, (2, 3, 7)>
<3, (1, 7, 8)>
<8, (2, 3, 4)>

So, the final answer is [4].
