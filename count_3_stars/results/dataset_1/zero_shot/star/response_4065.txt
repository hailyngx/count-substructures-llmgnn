Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are a total of [3] 3-stars in the given graph. 

Here are the unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<1, (0, 2, 5)>
<3, (4, 7, 9)>
