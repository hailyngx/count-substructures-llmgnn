Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].  
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:  
<4, (2, 7, 8)>  
<5, (3, 6, 7)>  
<6, (5, 6, 7)>  
<7, (4, 8, 9)>
