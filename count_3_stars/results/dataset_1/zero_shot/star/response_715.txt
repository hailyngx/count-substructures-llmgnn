Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are as follows:
[<0, (4, 9), (2, 1)>, <1, (2, 3), (5, 9)>, <2, (1, 4), (7, 2)>, <3, (1, 5)>, <6, (7, 8)>, <7, (2, 6)>, <8, (9, 6)>, <9, (0, 1)>]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
