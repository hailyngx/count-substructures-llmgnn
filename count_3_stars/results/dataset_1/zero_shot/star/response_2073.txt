Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

The 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<1, (5, 6, 7)>
<3, (0, 5, 9)>
<9, (3, 4, 8)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
