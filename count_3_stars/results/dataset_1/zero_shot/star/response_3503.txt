Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph consists of the following 3-stars:
[<0, (8, 9)>, <1, (2, 6, 7)>, <2, (1, 5, 6)>, <3, (4, 7, 9)>, <4, (3, 6, 9)>, <5, (2, 9, -)>, <6, (1, 2, 4)>, <7, (1, 3, 9)>, <8, (0, 1, 9)>, <9, (0, 5, 7)>]

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is therefore [10].
