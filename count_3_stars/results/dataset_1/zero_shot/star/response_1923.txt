Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:

\[ \left<0, (2, 3, 6)\right>, \left<1, (3, 6, 9)\right>, \left<2, (0, 6, 7)\right>, \left<3, (0, 1, 7)\right>, \left<4, (2, 5, 9)\right>, \left<5, (2, 4, 8)\right>, \left<6, (1, 2, 6)\right>, \left<7, (2, 3, 7)\right>, \left<8, (5, 9, 8)\right>, \left<9, (1, 4, 8)\right> \]

Therefore, there are \[ \boxed{10} \] 3-stars in the given graph.
