Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 6, 2)>
<1, (0, 6, 3)>
<3, (1, 5, 8)>
<8, (2, 5, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
