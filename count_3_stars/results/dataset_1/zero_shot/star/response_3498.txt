Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:
```
0 -- 2 -- 4
|         |
6 -- 3 -- 5
|         |
9    1    7
         |
         8
```
Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 6, and 9: <0, (2, 6, 9)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 5, and 7: <1, (3, 5, 7)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 5, and 6: <8, (2, 5, 6)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 3, and 5: <4, (2, 3, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
