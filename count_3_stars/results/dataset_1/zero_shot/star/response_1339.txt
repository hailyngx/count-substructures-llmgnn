Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (4, 2) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
The three-stars in the given graph are <1, (6, 9, 1)>, <2, (4, 7, 2)>, and <7, (2, 9, 7)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
