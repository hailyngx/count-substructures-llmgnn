Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (5, 2, 8)>
<1, (2, 3, 8)>
<1, (2, 8, 9)>
<1, (3, 1, 9)>
<5, (0, 2, 8)>
<5, (2, 8, 9)>
