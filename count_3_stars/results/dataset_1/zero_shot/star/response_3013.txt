Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are listed within <>:

<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<0, (2, 3, 9)>
<1, (0, 3, 8)>
<3, (0, 1, 6)>
<3, (7, 8, 9)>
<9, (2, 4, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
