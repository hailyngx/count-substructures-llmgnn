Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are [8] 3-star subgraphs in the given graph.  

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 4, 7)>
<2, (0, 4, 9)>
<2, (4, 7, 9)>
<3, (4, 5, 8)>
<4, (0, 2, 3)>
<4, (2, 3, 5)>
<4, (3, 5, 6)>
<8, (3, 4, 6)>
