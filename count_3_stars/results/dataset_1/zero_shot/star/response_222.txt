Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
There are 3 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (2, 7, 8)>
<1, (5, 7, 8)>
<2, (7, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
