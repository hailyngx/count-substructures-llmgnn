Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 9) (3, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph.  
The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 8, 9)>
<5, (6, 8, 9)>
<6, (5, 7, 9)>
<8, (0, 5, 9)>
<9, (0, 2, 3)>
<9, (5, 6, 8)>
