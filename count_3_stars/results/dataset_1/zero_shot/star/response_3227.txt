Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:
- <0, (1, 5, 6)>
- <1, (0, 3, 9)>
- <2, (3, 9, -)>
- <3, (1, 2, 7)>
- <6, (0, 7, -)>
- <9, (1, 2, -)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
