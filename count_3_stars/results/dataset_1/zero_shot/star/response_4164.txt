Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 7, and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to node 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 5 and 7.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0 and 6.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 7.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 7, and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 8, and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, 5, and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 6 and 7.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 5, and 6.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph:

There are five 3-stars, and they are as follows:
- <0, (3, 7, 9)>
- <5, (2, 4, 7)>
- <6, (3, 4, 9)>
- <7, (0, 4, 5)>
- <9, (1, 5, 6)>

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
