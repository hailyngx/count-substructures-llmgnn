Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 2 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are:

[<0, (6, 8, 4)>]
[<5, (4, 9, 5)>]
