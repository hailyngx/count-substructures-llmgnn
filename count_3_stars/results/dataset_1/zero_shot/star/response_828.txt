Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (1, 4, 6)>
2. <5, (0, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
