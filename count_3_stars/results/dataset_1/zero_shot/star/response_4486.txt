Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph.  
The 3-stars are:  
<0, (4, 5, 7)>  
<2, (8, 4, 9)>  
<3, (5, 7, 0)>  
<6, (4, 5, 7)>  

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
