Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:
[<0, (2, 4, 6)>, <0, (4, 6, 9)>, <1, (4, 5, 6)>] 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
