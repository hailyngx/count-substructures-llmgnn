Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].

The unique 3-star configurations are:
<0, (3, 6, 9)>
<1, (4, 6, 8)>
<2, (3, 9, 5)>
<3, (0, 2, 4)>
<4, (1, 3, 8)>
<6, (0, 1, 8)>
<8, (4, 6, 1)>
<9, (0, 2, 5)>
