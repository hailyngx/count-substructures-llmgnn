Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-star structures:
[<0, (1, 5, 9)>, <1, (0, 4, 8)>, <4, (1, 2, 5)>, <5, (0, 4, 9)>, <6, (3, 8, 9)>, <8, (1, 6, 9)>, <9, (0, 1, 2)>]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
