Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) 

Response:
There are a total of [7] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<2, (0, 3, 7)>
<3, (0, 2, 7)>
<4, (2, 6, 7)>
<6, (4, 2, 7)>
<7, (0, 2, 4)>
<8, (4, 7, 8)>
