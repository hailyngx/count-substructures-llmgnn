Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph. The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 5, 7)>
<1, (4, 9, 1)>
<2, (5, 6, 8)>
<3, (0, 4, 5)>
<4, (1, 3, 6)>
<5, (0, 2, 8)>
