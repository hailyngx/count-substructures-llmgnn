Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 8, 1)>
<2, (1, 7, 6)>
<3, (0, 4, 9)>
<4, (3, 5, 9)>
