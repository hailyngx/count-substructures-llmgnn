Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here are the 3-stars found:

<0, (3, 7, 9)>
<1, (2, 6, *)>
<2, (1, 4, 5)>
<3, (0, 4, 6)>
<4, (2, 3, 5)>
<5, (2, 3, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
