Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 7, 8)>
<1, (3, 4, 9)>
<2, (0, 4, 8)>
<3, (1, 4, 7)>
<4, (1, 2, 8)>
<5, (2, 6, 9)>
