Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 5, 8)>
<1, (2, 7, 9)>
<3, (0, 5, 9)>
<4, (5, 7, 8)>
