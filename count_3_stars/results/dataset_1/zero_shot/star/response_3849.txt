Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are as follows:
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<2, (0, 5, 6)>
<3, (1, 8, 9)>
<4, (0, 6, 9)>
<5, (0, 2, 7)>
<6, (0, 2, 4)>
<8, (0, 2, 3)>
