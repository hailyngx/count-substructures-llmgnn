Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 3-stars in this graph:  

[<0, (1, 2, 3)>]  
[<1, (0, 2, 5)>]  
[<5, (1, 2, 6)>]  
[<7, (1, 3, 9)>]  
[<8, (1, 4, 5)>]  

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
