Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph consists of several 3-star structures. Let's list them.

The 3-star structures in the graph are:
<0, (3, 9, -)>
<1, (2, 4, 5)>
<2, (1, 5, 9)>
<3, (0, 6, 7)>
<4, (1, 5, -)>
<5, (1, 2, 4)>
<6, (1, 3, 5)>
<7, (3, 9, -)>
<8, (3, 5, 6)>
<9, (0, 1, 6)>

Counting the number of 3-stars in the graph results in a total of [10].
