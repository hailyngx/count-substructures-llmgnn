Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [2] 3-stars in the given graph.
The unique 3-stars are <0, (1, 7, 8)> and <3, (4, 8, 9)>.
