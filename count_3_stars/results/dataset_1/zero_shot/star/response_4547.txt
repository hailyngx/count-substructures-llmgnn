Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are a total of [4] 3-stars in the given graph.  
The unique 3-stars are:  
<0, (3, 5, 9)>  
<2, (5, 8, 8)>  
<4, (3, 8, 8)>  
<7, (8, 9, 0)>
