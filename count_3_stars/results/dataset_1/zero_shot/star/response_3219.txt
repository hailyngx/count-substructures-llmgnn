Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the provided graph are as follows:
<0, (5, 1, 4)>
<1, (5, 0, 8)>
<3, (4, 9, 5)>
<4, (3, 5, 8)>
<8, (1, 2, 4)>
<9, (3, 5, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
