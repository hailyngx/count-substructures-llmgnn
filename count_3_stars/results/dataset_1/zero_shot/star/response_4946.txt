Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<1, (0, 2, 8)>
<2, (0, 1, 4)>
<3, (5, 8, 9)>
