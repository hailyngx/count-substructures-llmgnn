Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (2, 6, 3)>
<3, (2, 5, 6)>
<5, (3, 7, 2)>
<6, (1, 2, 3)>
<7, (5, 8, 3)>
<8, (6, 7, 3)>
