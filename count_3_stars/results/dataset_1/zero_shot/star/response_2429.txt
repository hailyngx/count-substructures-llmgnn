Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 9) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are:

<0, (2, 7, 9)>
<1, (3, 9, 5)>
<5, (6, 9, 3)>
<8, (7, 9, 0)>

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
