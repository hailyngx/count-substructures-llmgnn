Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are 3 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

The <0, (2, 4, 6)> 3-star has node 0 as the center and nodes 2, 4, and 6 as leaves. 

The <1, (4, 5, 6)> 3-star has node 1 as the center and nodes 4, 5, and 6 as leaves. 

The <5, (1, 2, 8)> 3-star has node 5 as the center and nodes 1, 2, and 8 as leaves. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
