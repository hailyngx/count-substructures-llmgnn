Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (3, 8, 9)>
<1, (3, 6, 9)>
<2, (5, 8, 9)>
<3, (0, 1, 8)>
<8, (0, 2, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 8)>
