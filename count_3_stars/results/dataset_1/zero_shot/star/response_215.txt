Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are 3-star structures in the given graph. 
The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<1, (0, 3, 6)>
<3, (1, 2, 8)>
<4, (0, 6, 9)>
<6, (0, 1, 4)>
<7, (0, 5, 7)> 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
