Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Since the graph has 10 nodes and each 3-star consists of 4 nodes (1 center node and 3 leaves), we need to find all possible combinations of 4 nodes out of 10. To do this, we can calculate the binomial coefficient \( \binom{10}{4} \) which represents the number of ways to choose 4 nodes out of 10. 

Given that there are 6 unique 3-stars found in the graph, the final answer is:
\[ [6] \]

The unique 3-stars are:
\[ <2, (3, 6, 9)> \]
\[ <3, (2, 4, 5)> \]
\[ <3, (2, 6, 9)> \]
\[ <3, (4, 6, 7)> \]
\[ <3, (5, 6, 9)> \]
\[ <6, (2, 3, 9)> \]
