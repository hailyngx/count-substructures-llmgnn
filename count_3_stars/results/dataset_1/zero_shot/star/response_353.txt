Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 3, 9)>
<1, (0, 8, 3)>
<2, (5, 9, 7)>
<3, (0, 4, 8)>
<4, (3, 6, 7)>
<7, (3, 5, 9)>
