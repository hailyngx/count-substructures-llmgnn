Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<3, (0, 5, 7)>
<3, (5, 7, 8)>
<6, (1, 2, 8)>
<6, (2, 5, 8)>
