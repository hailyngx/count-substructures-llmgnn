Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [12] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (6, 7, 8)>
<1, (4, 6, 8)>
<2, (6, 3, 1)>
<3, (4, 6, 9)>
<4, (1, 3, 7)>
<5, (7, 8, 1)>
<6, (0, 1, 2)>
<7, (0, 4, 5)>
<8, (0, 1, 9)>
<9, (3, 8, 6)>
<6, (0, 1, 7)>
<0, (6, 7, 8)>
