Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are [3] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are <0, (1, 8, 8)>, <3, (5, 6, 7)>, and <4, (2, 9, 8)>.
