Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are:

<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<1, (0, 4, 8)>
<2, (3, 5, 8)>
<3, (2, 9, 7)>

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
