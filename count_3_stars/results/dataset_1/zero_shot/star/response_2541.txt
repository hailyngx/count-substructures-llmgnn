Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 5, 9)>
<1, (4, 7, 8)>
<2, (0, 5, 6)>
<3, (7, 8, 8)>
<4, (1, 5, 9)>
<5, (0, 2, 4)>
<6, (2, 7, 8)>
<7, (1, 3, 8)>
