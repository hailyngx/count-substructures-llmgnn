Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in this graph. 

The 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 6, 7)>
<1, (4, 7, 9)>
<2, (0, 3, 9)>
<3, (2, 4, 7)>
<4, (1, 3, 7)>
<7, (0, 1, 3)> 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
