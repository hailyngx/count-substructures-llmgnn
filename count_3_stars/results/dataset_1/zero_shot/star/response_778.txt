Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 9, X)>
<1, (5, 8, 9)>
<2, (5, X, X)>
<4, (6, X, X)>
<5, (1, 2, 8)>
<6, (4, X, X)>
<8, (1, 5, X)>
<9, (0, 1, 4)>
