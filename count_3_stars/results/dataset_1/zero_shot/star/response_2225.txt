Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are:
[<0, (1, 3, 4)>, <1, (0, 5, 7)>, <3, (0, 9, 9)>, <4, (0, 6, -)>, <5, (1, 9, -)>, <6, (4, -, -)>, <7, (0, 1, 9)>, <9, (0, 3, 5)>]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
