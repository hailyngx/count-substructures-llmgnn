Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 8 3-stars in the given graph. Here is the list of unique 3-stars found:
  
[<0, (2, 6, 8)>, <1, (2, 3, 6)>, <2, (0, 1, 8)>, <3, (1, 4, 5)>, <4, (3, 8, )>, <5, (3, )>, <6, (0, 1, 9)>, <7, (2, 8, )>]
