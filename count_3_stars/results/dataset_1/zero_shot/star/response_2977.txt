Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are:

    <0, (1, 2, 3)>
    <1, (0, 2, 3)>
    <2, (0, 1, 6)>
    <3, (0, 1, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
