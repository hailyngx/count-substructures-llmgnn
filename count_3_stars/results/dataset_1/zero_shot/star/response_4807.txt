Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are as follows:
- <0, (2, 6, 8)>
- <0, (2, 6, 9)>
- <1, (2, 3, 7)>
- <1, (2, 5, 7)>
- <1, (3, 5, 7)>
- <1, (6, 5, 7)>
- <6, (0, 8, 9)>
- <6, (1, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
