Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are 8 3-star subgraphs in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<1, (2, 3, 8)>
<3, (0, 1, 5)>
<3, (1, 4, 7)>
<3, (0, 5, 6)>
<4, (3, 6, 8)>
<5, (0, 3, 7)>
<6, (0, 4, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
