Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) 

Response:
There are a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph. The unique 3-stars are:

<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<0, (5, 6, 8)>
<1, (3, 4, 8)>
<3, (1, 7, 6)>
<4, (0, 1, 5)>
<5, (0, 6, 8)>
