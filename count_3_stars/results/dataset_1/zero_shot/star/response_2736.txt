Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The graph contains the following 3-stars:

[<0, (1, 7, 8)>, <2, (4, 5, 8)>, <4, (2, 6, 9)>, <5, (2, 7, 8)>, <7, (0, 1, 5)>, <8, (0, 2, 5)>, <9, (4, 7, 9)>]

Therefore, there are 7 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The final answer is [7].
