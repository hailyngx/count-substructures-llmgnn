Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 6) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (3, 7, 9)>
<3, (0, 6, 7)>
<5, (2, 4, 8)>
<6, (1, 3, 9)>
<7, (0, 4, 5)>
<9, (3, 5, 6)>
<2, (5, 4, 9)>
<4, (5, 7, 8)>
<1, (6, 9, 0)>
