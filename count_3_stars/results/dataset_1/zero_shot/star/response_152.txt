Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<1, (0, 2, 4)>
<4, (1, 8, -)>
<8, (0, 4, 7)>
