Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The 3-star patterns are as follows:

<0, (3, 7, 9)>
<1, (3, 4, 5)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<5, (1, 2, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
