Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<2, (1, 4, 9)>
<3, (1, 6, 9)>
<6, (0, 3, 4)>
