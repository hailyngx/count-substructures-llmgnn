Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 0) 

Response:
In this graph with 10 nodes and 22 edges, there are [3] 3-stars.

The 3-stars are:
<0, (6, 8, 9)>
<1, (4, 6, -)>
<2, (3, 4, 7)>
