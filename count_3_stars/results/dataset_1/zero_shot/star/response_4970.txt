Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There is a total of [4] 3-stars in the given graph.

<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<1, (0, 4, 6)>
<2, (4, 6, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 5)>
