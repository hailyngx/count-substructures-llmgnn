Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are a total of 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
Here is the list of 3-stars and their corresponding central and leaf nodes:
<0, (6, 9)>
<1, (2, 3, 5)>
<2, (1, 4, 7)>
<3, (1, 4, 5)>
<4, (2, 3, 7)>
<7, (1, 2, 4)>
So, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
