Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 3) (8, 3) (9, 1) 

Response:
There are 3 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The 3-stars are:
- <0, (1, 2, 6)>
- <1, (0, 3, 9)>
- <3, (1, 4, 6)>

Therefore, the final answer is [3].
