Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The graph contains the following 3-stars:
[<0, (3, 4, 8)>, <1, (5, 7, 9)>, <6, (2, 7, 8)>, <7, (1, 5, 6)>, <8, (0, 5, 7)>, <9, (1, 6, 7)>]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
