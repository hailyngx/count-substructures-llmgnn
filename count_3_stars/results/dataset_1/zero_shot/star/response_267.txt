Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are:

- <0, (4, 6, 7)>
- <1, (2, 4, 7)>
- <2, (1, 4, 9)>
- <4, (0, 1, 3)>
- <6, (0, 4, 7)>
- <7, (0, 1, 6)>
- <9, (2, 4, 6)>

Therefore, there are [7] 3-stars in the graph.
