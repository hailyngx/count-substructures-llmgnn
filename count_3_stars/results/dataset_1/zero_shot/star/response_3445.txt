Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [5] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (7, 9, 1)>
<1, (7, 0, 9)>
<2, (7, 6, 8)>
<6, (7, 2, 8)>
