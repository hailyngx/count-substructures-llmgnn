Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are listed inside <>:
   
<0, (3, 5, 8)>
<3, (0, 4, 5)>
<4, (1, 3, 5)>
<5, (0, 1, 2)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
