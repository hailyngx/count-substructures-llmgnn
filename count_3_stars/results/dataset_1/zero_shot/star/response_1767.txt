Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [6] unique 3-stars in the given graph.  
The unique 3-stars are:  
<0, (1, 8, 9)>  
<1, (0, 3, 6)>  
<3, (1, 5, 7)>  
<4, (5, 9, 0)>  
<5, (3, 4, 8)>  
<6, (1, 7, 9)>
