Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 5 unique 3-stars in this graph. The total count of 3-stars is [5].
    
<0, (5, 7, 8)>
<1, (5, 8, 9)>
<2, (7, 8, 6)>
<4, (7, 9, 8)>
<9, (0, 1, 8)>
