Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<1, (0, 5, 8)>
<5, (0, 1, 9)>
