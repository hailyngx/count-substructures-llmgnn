Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph contains 10 nodes and 26 edges. Let's count the number of 3-stars present in the graph.

To form a 3-star, we need to find a node that is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Analyzing the edges provided, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:
1. Center node: 2, Leaves: 6, 8, 4
2. Center node: 3, Leaves: 5, 8, 9
3. Center node: 4, Leaves: 2, 3, 5
4. Center node: 5, Leaves: 0, 3, 4
5. Center node: 8, Leaves: 2, 3, 4
6. Center node: 9, Leaves: 3, 4, 8

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6] and they are <2, (6, 8, 4)>, <3, (5, 8, 9)>, <4, (2, 3, 5)>, <5, (0, 3, 4)>, <8, (2, 3, 4)>, <9, (3, 4, 8)>.
