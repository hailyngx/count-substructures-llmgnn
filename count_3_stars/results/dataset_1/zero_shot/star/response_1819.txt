Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [0]. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (3, 8, 9)>
<3, (1, 2, 8)>
<4, (1, 5, 6)>
<5, (2, 4, 7)>
<8, (0, 1, 9)>
