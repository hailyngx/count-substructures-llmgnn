Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 2) (7, 1) (8, 4) 

Response:
The given graph consists of the following 3-stars:
    - <0, (2, 3, 4)>
    - <0, (2, 3, 5)>
    - <0, (3, 1, 4)>
    - <0, (3, 1, 5)>
    - <0, (4, 8, 2)>
    - <0, (5, 3, 1)>
  
Since all 3-stars have been accounted for, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
