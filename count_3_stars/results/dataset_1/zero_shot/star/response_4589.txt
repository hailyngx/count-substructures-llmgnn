Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be calculated by looking at each node and finding the number of 3-stars it belongs to. Let's go through each node:

Node 0 forms 0 3-stars.
Node 1 forms 2 3-stars: <1, (0, 5, 9)> and <1, (0, 5, 2)>.
Node 2 forms 2 3-stars: <2, (3, 8, 9)> and <2, (3, 5, 8)>.
Node 3 forms 1 3-star: <3, (2, 4, 9)>.
Node 4 forms 2 3-stars: <4, (3, 8, 9)> and <4, (3, 6, 9)>.
Node 5 forms 1 3-star: <5, (0, 1, 9)>.
Node 6 forms 1 3-star: <6, (4, 8, 9)>.
Node 8 forms 2 3-stars: <8, (0, 4, 9)> and <8, (2, 4, 9)>.
Node 9 forms 2 3-stars: <9, (1, 4, 5)> and <9, (1, 2, 8)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [14].
