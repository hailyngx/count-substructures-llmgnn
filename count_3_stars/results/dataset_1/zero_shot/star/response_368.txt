Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in this graph can be found by identifying all the 3-stars present. 

Given the edges provided, we can list the unique 3-stars as follows:
<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<0, (4, 5, 8)>
<0, (5, 8, 9)>
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<1, (0, 2, 8)>
<2, (0, 1, 5)>
<2, (0, 5, 6)>
<2, (0, 5, 9)>
<3, (1, 4, 6)>
<4, (0, 2, 6)>
<5, (0, 2, 8)>
<6, (2, 4, 8)>
<8, (0, 5, 6)>
<9, (0, 2, 6)>

Counting these unique 3-stars, we find that there are [15] 3-stars in the given graph.
