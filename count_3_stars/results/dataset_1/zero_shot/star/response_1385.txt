Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph.  

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 4, 1)>
<3, (4, 5, 9)>
<4, (1, 3, 6)>
<4, (2, 3, 7)>
<6, (4, 9, 1)>
<7, (4, 8, 6)>
