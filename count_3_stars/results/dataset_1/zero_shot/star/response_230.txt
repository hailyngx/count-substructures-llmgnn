Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 6) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are listed below:

<0, (1, 7, 8)>
<1, (0, 7, 8)>
<4, (0, 3, 8)>
<7, (0, 1, 6)>

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
