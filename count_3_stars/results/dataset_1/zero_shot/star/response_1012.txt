Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are [5] 3-stars in the given graph.

<0, (1, 7, 9)>
<1, (0, 4, 5)>
<2, (1, 5, 6)>
<5, (1, 2, 8)>
<6, (2, 9, 0)>
