Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here are the 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (3, 5, 2)>
<1, (7, 8, 9)>
<2, (3, 5, 8)>
<5, (0, 2, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
