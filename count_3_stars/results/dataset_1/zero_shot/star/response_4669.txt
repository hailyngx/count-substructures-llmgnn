Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph can be calculated as follows:

1. Start by identifying all nodes in the graph connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes are potential centers for 3-stars.
2. For each potential center node, check if it is connected to exactly three other unique nodes forming a valid 3-star.
3. Keep track of all unique 3-stars found.

After analyzing the given graph, the unique 3-stars found are:

<0, (3, 6, 7)>
<2, (1, 4, 8)>
<3, (0, 1, 9)>
<6, (0, 4, 9)>
<8, (1, 3, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
