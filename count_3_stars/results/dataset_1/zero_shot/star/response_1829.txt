Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
[counting the number of 3-stars]  
The central node of a 3-star can be any of the 10 nodes in the given graph. Let's go through each node and see if it forms a 3-star or not. 

Node 0 has 5 edges: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 6), (0, 8), (0, 9)  
- (0, 2) forms a 3-star: <0, (2, 6, 8)>  
- (0, 3) forms a 3-star: <0, (2, 8, 9)>  
no 3-stars with remaining edges

Node 1 has 5 edges: (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (1, 7)  
no 3-stars with these edges

Node 2 has 8 edges: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 7), (2, 8), (2, 9)  
- (2, 0) forms a 3-star: <2, (0, 3, 6)>  
- (2, 1) forms a 3-star: <2, (0, 4, 7)>  
- (2, 3) forms a 3-star: <2, (0, 1, 4)>  
no 3-stars with remaining edges

Node 3 has 5 edges: (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 7), (3, 9)  
no 3-stars with these edges

Node 4 has 3 edges: (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 9)  
no 3-stars with these edges

Node 5 has 3 edges: (5, 2), (5, 8), (5, 9)  
no 3-stars with these edges

Node 6 has 2 edges: (6, 0), (6, 1)  
no 3-stars with these edges

Node 7 has 3 edges: (7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 3)  
no 3-stars with these edges

Node 8 has 3 edges: (8, 0), (8, 2), (8, 5)  
no 3-stars with these edges

Node 9 has 5 edges: (9, 0), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 5)  
- (9, 0) forms a 3-star: <9, (0, 2, 3)>  
no 3-stars with remaining edges

In total, there are [2] 3-stars in the given graph:
<0, (2, 6, 8)>, <0, (2, 8, 9)>
