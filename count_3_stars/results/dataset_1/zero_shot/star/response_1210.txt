Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<1, (0, 6, 9)>
<6, (1, 4, 9)>
