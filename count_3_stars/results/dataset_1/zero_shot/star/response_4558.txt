Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are listed:

<0, (3, 4, 7)>
<3, (0, 2, 8)>
<3, (6, 8, 9)>
<9, (5, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
