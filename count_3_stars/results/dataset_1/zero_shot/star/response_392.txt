Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [9] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (3, 4, 6)>
<1, (3, 6, 7)>
<2, (3, 1, 0)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<4, (0, 3, 6)>
<4, (1, 3, 7)>
<4, (2, 3, 6)>
<5, (4, 8, 9)>
<5, (8, 9, 4)>
