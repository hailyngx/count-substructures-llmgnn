Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 4.

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<2, (1, 7, 8)>
<6, (0, 7, 9)>
<8, (1, 4, 7)>

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
