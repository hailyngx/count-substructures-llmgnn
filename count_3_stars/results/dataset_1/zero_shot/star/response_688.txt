Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are [3] 3-stars in the given graph.  
The unique 3-stars found are:  
<0, (2, 7, 9)>  
<2, (0, 5, 6)>  
<3, (4, 6, 9)>
