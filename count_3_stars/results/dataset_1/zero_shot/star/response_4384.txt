Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 6, 8)>
<1, (0, 6, 8)>
<2, (6, 7, 8)>
<3, (6, 7, 9)>
<5, (8, 9, 6)>
<7, (2, 3, 9)>
