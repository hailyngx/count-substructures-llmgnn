Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<1, (2, 4, 8)>
<2, (1, 4, 6)>
<4, (1, 2, 9)>
<6, (3, 2, 7)>
