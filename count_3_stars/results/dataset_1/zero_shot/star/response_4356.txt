Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (6, 8, 5)>
<1, (2, 5, 7)>
<2, (1, 3, 4)>
<2, (1, 5, 7)>
<3, (2, 7, 7)>
<7, (2, 3, 5)>
