Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 4, 7)>
<2, (5, 6, 9)>
<4, (0, 3, 9)>
