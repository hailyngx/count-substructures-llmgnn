Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 3-stars in the given graph.  

The unique 3-stars are:  
<0, (1, 4, 6)>  
<1, (0, 6, 8)>  
<2, (7, 8, 3)>  
<7, (2, 4, 9)>  

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
