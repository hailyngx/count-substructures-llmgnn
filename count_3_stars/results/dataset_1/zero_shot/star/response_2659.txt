Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 9) (5, 8) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are a total of [3] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (6, 7, 8)>
<2, (3, 8, 9)>
<8, (2, 5, 7)>
