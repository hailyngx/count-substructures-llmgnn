Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (5, 6, 7)>
<0, (5, 8, 9)>
<0, (6, 0, 7)>
<0, (7, 0, 6)>
