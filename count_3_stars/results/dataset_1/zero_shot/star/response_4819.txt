Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:
- <1, (3, 4, 5)>
- <2, (1, 6, 8)>
- <3, (1, 6, 7)>
- <4, (1, 9, None)>
- <5, (0, 1, 7)>
- <6, (2, 3, None)>
- <7, (3, 5, None)>
- <8, (2, None, None)>
- <9, (4, None, None)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
