Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are total of [6] 3-star subgraphs in the given graph. 

Here are the unique 3-stars present in the graph:
<0, (1, 3, 7)>
<1, (0, 6, 7)>
<2, (4, 8, 9)>
<3, (0, 4, 9)>
<4, (2, 3, 8)>
<7, (0, 1, 8)>
