Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (1, 6, 4)>
<1, (0, 2, 7)>
<4, (2, 6, 8)>
<7, (1, 3, 9)>
