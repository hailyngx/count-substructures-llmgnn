Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are three 3-stars in the given graph. Here is the breakdown:

1. <0, (3, 4, 8)>
2. <1, (4, 5, 7)>
3. <2, (7, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
