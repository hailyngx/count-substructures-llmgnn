Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 8, 0)>
<1, (7, 8, 1)>
<3, (2, 4, 8)>
<3, (4, 8, 6)>
<7, (1, 5, 6)>
<8, (1, 3, 9)>
