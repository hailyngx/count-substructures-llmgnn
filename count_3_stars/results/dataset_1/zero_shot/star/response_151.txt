Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 8) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The center nodes of the 3-stars can only be nodes with degree 3. In this graph, the only nodes with degree 3 are nodes 5 and 9. Let's examine the 3-stars with center nodes 5 and 9:

1. Center node 5:
    - Leaves: 0, 3, 9
    - <5, (0, 3, 9)>

2. Center node 9:
    - Leaves: 3, 5, 6, 8
    - <9, (3, 5, 6)>
    - <9, (3, 5, 8)>
    - <9, (3, 6, 8)>
    - <9, (5, 6, 8)>

Therefore, there are a total of [5] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
