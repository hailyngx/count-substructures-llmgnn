Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
  
<0, (6, 7, 8)>
<1, (5, 7, 8)>
<2, (6, 8, 8)>
<4, (9, 6, 9)>
<5, (1, 5, 8)>
<6, (0, 2, 9)>
