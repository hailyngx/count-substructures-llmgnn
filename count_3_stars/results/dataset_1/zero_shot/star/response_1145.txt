Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
Considering the definition of a 3-star graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go ahead and count the number of unique 3-stars in the given graph.

Given the edge list, we can determine the following 3-stars:
<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<1, (0, 2, 5)>
<2, (0, 1, 4)>
<2, (1, 5, 7)>
<3, (7, 9, None)>
<4, (2, 6, 7)>
<4, (6, 7, 8)>
<5, (1, 2, 8)>
<6, (4, 7, 8)>
<7, (1, 2, 3)>
<7, (2, 4, 6)>
<8, (2, 5, 6)>
<9, (3, None, None)>

Count of 3-stars: [13]
