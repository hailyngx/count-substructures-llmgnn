Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The 3-stars are:

<0, (4, 5, 1)>
<2, (4, 9, 5)>
<3, (4, 5, 8)>
<7, (5, 9, 0)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
