Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 9) (3, 1) (4, 0) (5, 8) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 4 3-stars in the given graph. 
The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 1, 9)>
<5, (8, 6, 9)>
<7, (9, 1, 6)>
<8, (5, 6, 9)>

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
