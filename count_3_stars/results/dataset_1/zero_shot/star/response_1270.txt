Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 5) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be found by counting the number of 3-stars centered at each node and then summing them up.

Let's count the 3-stars for each central node:
- Node 0: (0, 1, 5), (0, 1, 6) [2 3-stars]
- Node 1: (1, 0, 5), (1, 2, 5), (1, 5, 7), (1, 6, 7) [4 3-stars]
- Node 2: (2, 1, 5), (2, 1, 6), (2, 1, 7) [3 3-stars]
- Node 3: (3, 1, 6) [1 3-star]
- Node 4: (4, 2, 5) [1 3-star]
- Node 5: (5, 0, 1), (5, 1, 2), (5, 1, 7), (5, 2, 7), (5, 6, 7), (5, 7, 8) [6 3-stars]
- Node 6: (6, 0, 1), (6, 1, 2), (6, 1, 3), (6, 1, 7), (6, 2, 7), (6, 3, 7) [6 3-stars]
- Node 7: (7, 1, 5), (7, 1, 6), (7, 2, 5), (7, 2, 6), (7, 3, 6), (7, 5, 6) [6 3-stars]
- Node 8: No 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 2 + 4 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 6 + 6 + 6 = 29.

Thus, the final answer is [29], and the list of unique 3-stars found in the graph is:
<0, (1, 5, 6)>, <1, (0, 5, 6)>, <1, (2, 5, 7)>, <1, (6, 7, 5)>, <2, (1, 5, 6)>, <3, (1, 6, 0)>, <4, (5, 2, 1)>, <5, (0, 1, 6)>, <5, (1, 2, 7)>, <5, (6, 7, 1)>, <5, (7, 8, 5)>, <6, (0, 1, 5)>, <6, (1, 2, 7)>, <6, (1, 3, 7)>, <6, (2, 7, 1)>, <6, (3, 7, 1)>, <7, (1, 5, 6)>, <7, (1, 6, 0)>, <7, (2, 5, 6)>, <7, (2, 6, 1)>, <7, (3, 6, 1)>, <7, (5, 6, 1)>.
