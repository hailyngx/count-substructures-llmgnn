Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [8] 3-stars in the given graph.  
The unique 3-stars are:  
<0, (1, 2, 4)>  
<0, (1, 2, 5)>  
<0, (1, 2, 6)>  
<0, (2, 7, 4)>  
<0, (2, 7, 5)>  
<0, (2, 7, 6)>  
<0, (4, 6, 7)>  
<0, (4, 6, 9)>
