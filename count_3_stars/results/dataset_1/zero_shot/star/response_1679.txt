Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (2, 5) (2, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) 

Response:
The given graph can be visualized as follows:

    0 -- 7
    |     | \ 
    7 -- 4 -- 5 -- 6
           |
           2 -- 8

Let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph:

<4, (5, 6, 7)>
<5, (2, 4, 6)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
