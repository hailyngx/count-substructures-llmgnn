Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (9, 2) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.  
 
The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (3, 5, 7)>  
<2, (5, 3, 9)>  
<4, (1, 6, 4)>  
<6, (4, 7, 6)>
