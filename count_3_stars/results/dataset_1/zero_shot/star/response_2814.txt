Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are a total of [3] 3-stars in the given graph. 

Here are the unique 3-stars found: 
<0, (7, 8, 9)>
<3, (7, 8, 9)>
<6, (1, 2, 4)>
