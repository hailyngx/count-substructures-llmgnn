Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 6, 7)>
<1, (5, 6, 9)>
<2, (0, 4, 6)>
<3, (4, 6, 7)>
<4, (2, 3, 6)>
<5, (1, 6, 9)>
<6, (0, 1, 2)>
<7, (0, 4, 6)>
