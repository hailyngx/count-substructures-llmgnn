Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
    
<0, (2, 3, 7)>
<0, (2, 7, 9)>
<0, (3, 7, 9)>
<0, (2, 7, 9)>
<1, (2, 9, 5)>
<2, (0, 1, 4)>
<2, (0, 4, 7)>
<3, (0, 4, 9)>
