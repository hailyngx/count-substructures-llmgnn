Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-star structures:
- <0, (2, 3, 4)>
- <0, (3, 7, 9)>
- <0, (4, 1, 7)>
- <0, (9, 2, 3)>
- <4, (1, 5, 6)>
- <4, (5, 8, 6)>
There are a total of [6] 3-stars in the graph.
