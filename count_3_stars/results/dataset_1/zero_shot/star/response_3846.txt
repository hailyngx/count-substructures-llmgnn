Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated by examining each node and finding the ones that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list the 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (4, 6, 8)>
<1, (4, 6, 8)>
<2, (4, 6, 7)>
<3, (2, 4, 5)>
<4, (0, 1, 2)>
<5, (4, 5, 7)>
<6, (0, 1, 2)>
<7, (2, 5, 7)>
<8, (0, 1, 6)>
<9, (0, 1, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
