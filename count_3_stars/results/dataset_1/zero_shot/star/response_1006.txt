Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The count is inside brackets: [4].
  
The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<2, (3, 4, 9)>
<6, (0, 4, 9)>
