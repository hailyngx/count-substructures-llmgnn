Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are 3 3-stars in the given graph. Here are the unique 3-stars found:
    
<0, (2, 5, 9)>
<1, (6, 8, 9)>
<6, (1, 3, 5)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
