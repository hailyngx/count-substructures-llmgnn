Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The 3-stars are:
<1, (4, 5, 6)>
<5, (1, 6, 9)>
<6, (1, 5, 8)>
<7, (3, 5, 9)>
