Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<3, (4, 5, 6)>
<4, (0, 1, 3)>
<7, (4, 6, 8)>
