Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 3, 9)>
<1, (0, 2, 4)>
<2, (1, 7, 9)>
<3, (0, 4, 9)>
<4, (1, 3, 6)>
