Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are <0, (5, 7, 8)>, <1, (5, 8, 9)>, and <2, (3, 7, 8)> 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
