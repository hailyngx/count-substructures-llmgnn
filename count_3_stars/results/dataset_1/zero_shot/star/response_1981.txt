Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (4, 5, 9)>
<3, (1, 4, 5)>
