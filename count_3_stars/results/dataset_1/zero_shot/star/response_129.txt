Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The center nodes (central nodes) can be: 0, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9.

Here are the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (1, 3, 8)>
<3, (0, 2, 4)>
<4, (3, 6, 8)>
<6, (4, 5, 9)>
<8, (0, 4, 9)>
<9, (6, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
