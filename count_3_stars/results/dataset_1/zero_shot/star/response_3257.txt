Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 9) (6, 8) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
The 3-stars are:
<8, (0, 6, 7)>
<9, (1, 2, 3)>
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [2].
