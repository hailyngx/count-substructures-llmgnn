Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [3] 3-stars in the given graph.  
The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (5, 7, 8)>
<3, (4, 6, 7)>
<4, (2, 3, 5)>
