Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (5, 8, 1)>
<1, (5, 8, 7)>
<2, (7, 9, 4)>
<4, (3, 5, 6)>
