Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are a total of 11 3-stars in the given graph. Here are the unique 3-stars found: 
<0, (1, 4, 9)>
<1, (0, 3, 7)>
<2, (3, 6, 9)>
<3, (1, 2, 7)>
<4, (0, 5, 9)>
<5, (3, 4, 6)>
<6, (2, 3, 9)>
<7, (1, 3, 8)>
<8, (7)>
<9, (0, 2, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [11].
