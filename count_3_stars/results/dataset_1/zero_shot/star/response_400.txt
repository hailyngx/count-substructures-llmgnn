Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated by finding all possible combinations of nodes where one node is the center and the other three nodes are connected to the center node. Given the edges provided, we can see that the possible 3-stars can be as follows:

<0, (6, 9, 1)>
<1, (4, 6, 0)>
<2, (3, 9, 5)>
<3, (2, 4, 8)>
<4, (1, 3, 7)>
<5, (8, 9, 2)>
<6, (0, 1, 4)>
<7, (4)>
<8, (5, 3)>
<9, (6, 0, 5)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we get a total of **9** 3-stars. Therefore, the final answer is **[9]**.
