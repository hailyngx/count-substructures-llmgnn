Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (3, 4, 7)>
<0, (3, 9, 2)>
<3, (0, 4, 5)>
<3, (2, 4, 6)>
<5, (3, 4, 8)>
<6, (2, 3, 8)>
