Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (6, 3, 9)>
<1, (7, 1, 0)>
<2, (4, 3, 5)>
<2, (5, 4, 8)>
<4, (2, 3, 5)>
<4, (3, 2, 9)>
<4, (5, 2, 8)>
