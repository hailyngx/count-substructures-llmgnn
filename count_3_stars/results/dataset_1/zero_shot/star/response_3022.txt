Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph. 

List of 3-stars:
<0, (2, 6, 8)>
<1, (3, 6, 8)>
<2, (0, 4, 5)>
<4, (2, 5, 8)>
