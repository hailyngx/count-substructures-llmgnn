Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph, which are:
<0, (3, 4, 9)>
<1, (4, 5, 9)>
<2, (5, 6, 8)>
<3, (0, 4, 6)>
<3, (4, 6, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
