Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The central nodes of potential 3-stars must be nodes with degree exactly 3. Let's identify those nodes:

Nodes with degree 3: 0, 2, 4, 5, 9

Now, let's check each potential 3-star:

1. Node 0
    - (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7)
    - <0, (2, 3, 4)> is a 3-star.

2. Node 2
    - (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9)
    - <2, (0, 5, 8)> is a 3-star.
    - <2, (0, 5, 9)> is a 3-star.

3. Node 4
    - (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9)
    - <4, (0, 3, 5)> is a 3-star.

4. Node 5
    - (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6)
    - <5, (0, 1, 2)> is a 3-star.
    - <5, (0, 1, 3)> is a 3-star.
    - <5, (0, 1, 4)> is a 3-star.
    - <5, (0, 2, 3)> is a 3-star.
    - <5, (0, 2, 4)> is a 3-star.
    - <5, (0, 3, 4)> is a 3-star.

5. Node 9
    - (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7)
    - <9, (2, 4, 7)> is a 3-star.

In total, there are [9] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
