Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6]. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 3, 5)>
<1, (4, 6, 7)>
<1, (5, 7, 9)>
<4, (0, 3, 9)>
<4, (1, 3, 5)>
<4, (9, 5, 0)>
