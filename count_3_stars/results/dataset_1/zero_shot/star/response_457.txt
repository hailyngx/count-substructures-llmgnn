Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (5, 6, 9)>
<2, (3, 5, 6)>
<3, (2, 8, 5)>
<4, (6, 9, 1)>
