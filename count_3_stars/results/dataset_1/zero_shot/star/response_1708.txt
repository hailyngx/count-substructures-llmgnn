Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 6 3-star structures in this graph. Here they are listed below:

<0, (2, 1, 6)>
<1, (2, 0, 4)>
<1, (2, 5, 9)>
<1, (4, 5, 9)>
<2, (0, 1, 6)>
<2, (1, 6, 8)>
