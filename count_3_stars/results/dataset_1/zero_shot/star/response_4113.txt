Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 5, 9)>
<2, (6, 7, 8)>
<4, (0, 7, 9)>
<5, (0, 9, 4)>
<6, (2, 8, 7)>
<8, (1, 2, 9)>
