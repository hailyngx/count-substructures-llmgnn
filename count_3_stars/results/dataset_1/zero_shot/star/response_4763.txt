Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph can be calculated by finding the number of nodes that can serve as the center node and then checking how many of them are connected to exactly three other nodes.

In this graph, the nodes and their connections are as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to node 3.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 5, and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 6, 7, 8.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 5, 9.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 7, 8.
- Node 6 is connected to node 2.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 7, 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 8.

From the connections, we see that nodes 1, 2, 5, and 8 are the only nodes that have exactly three connections, making them potential center nodes of 3-stars.

Now, we will find the unique 3-stars in the graph:

- <1, (2, 5, 9)>
- <2, (1, 7, 8)>
- <5, (1, 4, 7)>
- <8, (2, 5, 9)>

Counting these unique 3-stars, we get a total of [4].
