Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph. 
The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 8, 9)>
<1, (0, 3, 6)>
<3, (1, 8, 9)>
<4, (5, 7, 9)>
<5, (4, 6, 7)>
<7, (2, 4, 6)>
