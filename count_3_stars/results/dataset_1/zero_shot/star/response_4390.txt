Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are:
[<1, (2, 3, 8)>, <2, (1, 5, 8)>, <5, (2, 4, 9)>, <6, (5, 7, 8)>, <8, (1, 2, 6)>, <9, (2, 4, 8)>]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
