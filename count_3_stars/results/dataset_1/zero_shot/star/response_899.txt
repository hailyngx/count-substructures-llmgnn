Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<4, (0, 3, 5)>
<5, (0, 4, 6)>
<2, (3, 6, 9)>
<9, (2, 4, 5)>
