Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 6) (3, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph can be calculated by examining each node and counting the number of 3-stars centered at that node. 

Upon counting, the number of 3-stars is  <5, (1, 6, 8)>, <6, (2, 5, 7)>, <8, (5, 6, 9)>. 

Therefore, the final answer is [3].
