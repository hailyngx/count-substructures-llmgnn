Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (3, 8, 9)>
<3, (0, 8, 9)>
<5, (3, 6, 7)>
<6, (5, 7, 9)>
