Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph.  
Therefore, the final answer is [6]. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<1, (0, 2, 4)>
<2, (1, 5, 7)>
<3, (0, 6, 4)>
<4, (1, 6, 7)>
<5, (0, 2, 8)>
