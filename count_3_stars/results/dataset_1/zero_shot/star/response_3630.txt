Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<2, (3, 4, 8)>
