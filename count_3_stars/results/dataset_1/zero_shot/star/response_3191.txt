Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are a total of 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are with the central node listed first:

    <0, (2, 5, 6)>
    <4, (2, 8, 9)>
    <5, (0, 3, 8)>
    <6, (0, 3, 7)>
    <8, (3, 4, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [5].
