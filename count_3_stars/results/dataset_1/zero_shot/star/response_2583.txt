Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph.

<1, (0, 4, 5)>
<1, (4, 5, 9)>
<2, (5, 7, 9)>
<3, (4, 5, 8)>
<4, (1, 3, 9)>
<9, (1, 2, 3)>
