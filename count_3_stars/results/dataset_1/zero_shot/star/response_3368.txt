Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is as follows:
[6]

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<4, (1, 2, 3)>
<6, (3, 5, 7)>
<9, (2, 4, 8)>
<7, (5, 6, 8)>
<5, (6, 7, 8)>
<8, (7, 9, 4)>
