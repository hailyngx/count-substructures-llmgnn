Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 distinct 3-stars in the graph. Here is the list of unique 3-stars:

<0, (1, 7, 4)>
<1, (0, 6, 8)>
<4, (5, 7, 9)>
<6, (1, 4, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
