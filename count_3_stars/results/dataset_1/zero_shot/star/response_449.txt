Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph contains the following 3-stars:

[<0, (4, 7, 8)>, <2, (3, 4, 8)>, <2, (4, 5, 6)>, <5, (2, 6, 9)>, <5, (6, 2, 9)>, <6, (1, 2, 5)>, <6, (2, 5, 9)>]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
