Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [8] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 6, 7)>
<0, (6, 7, 9)>
<1, (3, 4, 5)>
<2, (0, 8, 9)>
<3, (1, 5, 9)>
<4, (1, 5, 8)>
<5, (3, 4, 8)>
<8, (4, 5, 6)>
