Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 7) (6, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (9, 3) 

Response:
The given graph is as follows:
```
0 -- 3
|    |
3 -- 1
|  / |
9 -- 7 -- 5
    /
   6
    |
    2
```

To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we can look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes (a central node connected to exactly three leaves). Let's identify the 3-stars:

1. <3, (0, 1, 9)>
2. <3, (1, 0, 9)>
3. <3, (7, 5, 9)>
4. <7, (3, 5, 9)>
5. <5, (7, 3, 9)>
6. <9, (3, 5, 7)>

Counting these 6 unique 3-stars, we can now provide the final answer inside brackets:
[6]
