Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are 4 different 3-stars in this graph. Here they are listed inside <> brackets:

<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<1, (0, 2, 6)>
<2, (1, 7, 8)>
<3, (0, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4].
