Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in this graph. They are:
<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<1, (0, 5, 8)>
<2, (0, 5, 7)>
<3, (1, 4, 7)>
<4, (3, 6, 7)>
<5, (0, 1, 8)>
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
