Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 3) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are 3 unique 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <1, (0, 2, 4)>
2. <1, (2, 4, 9)>
3. <3, (2, 6, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
