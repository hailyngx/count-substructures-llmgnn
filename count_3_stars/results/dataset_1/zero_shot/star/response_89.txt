Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 3 3-stars in the given graph. The unique 3-stars are:

<0, (9, 2, 4)>
<1, (2, 5, 9)>
<2, (1, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [3].
