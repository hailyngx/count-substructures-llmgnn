Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [9] 3-stars in the given graph. 

<0, (2, 5, 6)>
<1, (3, 8, 9)>
<2, (0, 5, 6)>
<3, (1, 5, 7)>
<4, (7, 9, 8)>
<5, (0, 2, 8)>
<6, (0, 2, 8)>
<7, (3, 4, 8)>
<8, (1, 5, 7)>
