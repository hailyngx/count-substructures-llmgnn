Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 9) (5, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are two 3-stars in the given graph. The unique 3-stars are as follows:
- <1, (5, 8, 2)>
- <2, (6, 7, 8)>
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
