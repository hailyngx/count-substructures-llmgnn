Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (5, 8, 1)>
<4, (2, 5, 7)>
<4, (5, 7, 9)>
<9, (4, 5, 6)>
