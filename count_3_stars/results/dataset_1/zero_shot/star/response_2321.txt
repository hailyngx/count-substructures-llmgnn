Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [2] 3-stars in the given graph.  

The unique 3-stars are:  
<0, (2, 3, 5)>  
<1, (3, 4, 7)>
