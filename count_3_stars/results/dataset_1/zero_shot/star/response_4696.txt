Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (3, 4, 8)>
<1, (3, 5, 6)>
<2, (3, 4, 6)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<4, (0, 2, 5)>
<8, (0, 1, 7)>
