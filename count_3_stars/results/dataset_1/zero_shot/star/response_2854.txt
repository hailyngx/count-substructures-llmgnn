Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (8, 6) (9, 4) 

Response:
The given graph can be visualized as follows:

```
      1
     /|\
    3 4 7
       |
       9
      /
     4 - 6 - 8
```

To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify the central node connected to exactly three other nodes. In this case, the only 3-star present in the graph is:

[1]

Unique 3-star: <1, (3, 4, 7)>
