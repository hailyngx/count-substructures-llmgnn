Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are [<3>] 3-stars in the given graph. 
The unique 3-stars are: <0, (1, 2, 9)>
