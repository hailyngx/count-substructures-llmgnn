Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
There are three 3-stars in the given graph. Here is the count within brackets [] and the unique 3-stars <center, (leaf1, leaf2, leaf3)>:

[3]
<0, (3, 4, 7)>
<1, (4, 8, 9)>
<2, (3, 5, 7)>
