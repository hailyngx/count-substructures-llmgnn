Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
    
    The unique 3-stars found are:
    <0, (2, 7, 0)>
    <2, (0, 7, 5)>
    <4, (7, 6, 5)>
    <6, (3, 9, 4)>
