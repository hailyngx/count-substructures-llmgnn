Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The 3-star graphs present in the given graph are as follows:
<0, (6, 7, 3)>
<1, (2, 3, 0)>
<2, (1, 3, 8)>
<3, (1, 2, 4)>
<4, (2, 3, 8)>
<5, (9, 3, 0)>
<6, (0, 7, 8)>
<7, (0, 2, 8)>
<8, (2, 4, 6)>
<9, (3, 5, 8)>
