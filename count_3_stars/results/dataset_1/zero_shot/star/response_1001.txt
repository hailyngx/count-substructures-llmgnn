Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The central nodes (0 to 9) are connected to the following unique sets of leaves to form 3-stars:
<0, (1, 4, 7)>
<2, (0, 4, 9)>
<3, (2, 4, 5)>
<5, (3, 7, 8)>
<6, (0, 9, 7)>
<8, (1, 0, 5)>
<9, (2, 6, 7)>

Therefore, there are a total of [7] 3-stars in the given graph.
