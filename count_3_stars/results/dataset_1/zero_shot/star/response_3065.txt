Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 3, 6)>
<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<0, (3, 6, 7)>
<2, (4, 6, 9)>
<4, (2, 6, 9)>
<4, (6, 8, 9)>
<7, (5, 9, 7)>
<8, (1, 7, 4)>
