Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
  
<0, (4, 6, 7)>
<1, (2, 4, 8)>
<2, (1, 8, 4)>
<3, (4, 6, 7)>
<4, (0, 1, 3)>
<8, (1, 2, 4)>
