Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 5 3-stars in the given graph. Here is the count in brackets followed by the unique 3-stars in angled brackets:

\[5\]
<0, (1, 7, 8)>
<1, (0, 7, 8)>
<2, (3, 6, 8)>
<3, (2, 8, 9)>
<9, (1, 4, 6)>
