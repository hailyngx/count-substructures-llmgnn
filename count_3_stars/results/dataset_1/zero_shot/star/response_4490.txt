Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
There is 1 unique 3-star in the given graph. 

The 3-star is:
<0, (2, 3, 4)> 

Therefore, the final answer is [1].
