Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

The 3-stars are:
<1, (2, 4, 5)>
<2, (1, 7, 9)>
<4, (1, 7, 9)>
<5, (1, 8)> 

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
