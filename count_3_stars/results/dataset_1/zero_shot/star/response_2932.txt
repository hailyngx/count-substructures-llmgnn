Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (5, 6, 8)>
<1, (2, 8, 9)>
<2, (1, 3, 6)>
<4, (3, 6, 8)>
