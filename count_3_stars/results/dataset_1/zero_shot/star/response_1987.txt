Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are 6 3-stars in the given graph. The unique 3-stars are:

<0, (2, 3, 8)>
<3, (0, 4, 7)>
<4, (3, 6, -)>
<6, (4, -,-)>
<7, (2, 3, 8)>
<9, (1, 3, -)>

Therefore, the final answer is [6].
