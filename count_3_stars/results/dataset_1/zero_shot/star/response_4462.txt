Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph contains the following 3-stars:

[<0, (5, 4, 9)>, <1, (4, 8, 3)>, <2, (7, 4, 8)>, <3, (8, 1, 0)>, <4, (1, 8, 9)>, <5, (0, 8, 9)>, <6, (9, 5, 4)>, <7, (2, 4, 9)>, <8, (1, 3, 5)>, <9, (4, 5, 6)>]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
