Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
The graph contains the following 3-stars: <0, (1, 3, 4)>, <0, (6, 8, 4)>, <0, (8, 3, 6)>, and <3, (2, 8, 9)>. Therefore, there are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.
