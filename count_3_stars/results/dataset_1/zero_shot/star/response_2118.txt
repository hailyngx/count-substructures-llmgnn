Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph. The unique 3-stars are:

<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<1, (0, 2, 8)>
<1, (6, 8, 9)>
