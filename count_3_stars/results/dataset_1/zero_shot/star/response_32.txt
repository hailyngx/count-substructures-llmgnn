Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are listed once:
<0, (2, 5, 6)>
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<3, (2, 4, 7)>
<4, (3, 6, 5)>
<5, (0, 6, 9)> 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
