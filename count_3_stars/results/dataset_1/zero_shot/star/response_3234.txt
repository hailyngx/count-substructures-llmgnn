Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
    The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
    <0, (2, 4, 9)>
    <1, (2, 5, 6)>
    <2, (0, 1, 4)>
    <5, (1, 7, 8)>
