Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) 

Response:
There are a total of 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are:
<0, (2, 4, 2)>
<1, (2, 8, 6)>
<2, (0, 1, 4)>
<3, (1, 4, 7)>
<4, (0, 2, 3)>
<6, (1, 7, 8)>
Therefore, the final answer is [6].
