Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The central nodes are: 0, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9
The leaves are: 
- For central node 0: 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9
- For central node 2: 0, 6, 7, 9
- For central node 3: 0, 7, 9
- For central node 7: 0, 2, 3, 8
- For central node 8: 0, 4, 7
- For central node 9: 0, 1, 2, 3

Hence, the number of 3-stars in this graph is [5].  
The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (2, 5, 7)>
<2, (0, 6, 9)>
<3, (0, 7, 9)>
<7, (2, 0, 9)>
<8, (4, 0, 7)>
