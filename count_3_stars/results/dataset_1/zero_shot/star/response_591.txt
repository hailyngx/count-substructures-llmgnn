Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].  
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:  
<0, (1, 2, 5)>  
<1, (0, 3, 6)>  
<3, (0, 1, 9)>  
<5, (0, 2, 7)>
