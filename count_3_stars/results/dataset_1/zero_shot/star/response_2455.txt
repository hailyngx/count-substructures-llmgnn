Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph.  

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<3, (1, 2, 9)>
<3, (6, 7, 9)>
<6, (7, 3, 9)>
<7, (3, 6, 9)>
<9, (3, 6, 7)>
