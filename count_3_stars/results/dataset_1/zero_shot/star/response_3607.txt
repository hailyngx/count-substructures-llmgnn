Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
The 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 6, 9)>
<1, (4, 5, 6)>
<2, (0, 6, 9)>
<4, (1, 5, 9)>
<5, (1, 4, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
