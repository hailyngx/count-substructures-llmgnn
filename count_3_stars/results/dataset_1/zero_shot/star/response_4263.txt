Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the graph can be found by counting how many nodes can be the center of a 3-star. Since a 3-star has a center connected to exactly three other nodes, we can check each node to see if it is the center of a 3-star.

Based on the given edges, we can identify the 3-stars:

<0, (4, 7, 9)>
<2, (5, 7, 9)>
<3, (4, 6, 9)>
<4, (0, 3, 7)>
<7, (0, 4, 8)>
<9, (1, 3, 5)>

Therefore, there are [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
