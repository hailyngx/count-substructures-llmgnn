Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are three 3-stars in the given graph. The 3-stars are:
<1, (3, 4, 7)>
<3, (1, 6, 9)>
<6, (2, 3, 8)>
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
