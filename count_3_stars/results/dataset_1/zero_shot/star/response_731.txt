Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in this graph. The number of 3-stars is [4].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<1, (2, 6, 9)>
<2, (1, 3, 4)>
<2, (4, 5, 7)>
