Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 2) (5, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (5, 7, 8)>
<1, (3, 9, 8)>
<2, (4, 6, 8)>
