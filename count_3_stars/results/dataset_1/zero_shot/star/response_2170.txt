Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 1) 

Response:
There are 3 unique 3-stars in the given graph:
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<1, (0, 4, 5)>
<3, (0, 6, 7)>
