Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [3] 3-stars in the given graph.  
The unique 3-stars found are: <2, (0, 5, 6)>, <3, (1, 7, 8)>, <7, (2, 5, 8)>.
