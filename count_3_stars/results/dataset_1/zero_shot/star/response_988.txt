Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

Here is the list of 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (5, 9)>
<1, (3, 6, 7)>
<2, (3, 4, 8)>
<3, (1, 2, 4)>
<4, (2, 3, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
