Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph. 

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (6, 8, 9)>
<1, (7, 9, 5)>
<2, (5, 6, 8)>
<5, (2, 6, 9)>
<6, (0, 2, 4)>
<8, (0, 5, 7)>
