Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
    
<0, (4, 8, 9)>
<1, (2, 5, 7)>
<2, (1, 5, 7)>
<3, (5, 8, 9)>
<4, (0, 7, 9)>
<5, (1, 2, 3)>
