Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
The 3-stars are: 
<1, (3, 5, 7)>
<2, (6, 8, 9)>
<4, (8, 0, 9)>
<5, (1, 6, 8)>
Therefore, the final answer is [4].
