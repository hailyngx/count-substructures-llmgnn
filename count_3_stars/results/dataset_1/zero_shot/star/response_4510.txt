Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are <5, (2, 4, 6)> and <9, (0, 1, 4)>.
