Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<1, (0, 6, 8)>
<1, (0, 6, 9)>
<1, (0, 8, 9)>
