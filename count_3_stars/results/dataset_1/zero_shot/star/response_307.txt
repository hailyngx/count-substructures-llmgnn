Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
There are [10] total 3-stars in the given graph. The unique 3-stars are as follows:
<0, (2, 8, 9)>
<1, (2, 7, 9)>
<2, (0, 1, 7)>
<3, (5, 6, 8)>
