Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph contains the following 3-stars:
- <0, (1, 2, 3)>
- <0, (4, 7, 1)>
- <0, (2, 4, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
