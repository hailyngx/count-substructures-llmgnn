Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be counted by observing the central nodes and their corresponding connected nodes. 

The central nodes in the graph are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (3, 5, 8)>
<1, (2, 7, 9)>
<2, (1, 4, 6)>
<3, (0, 4, -)>
<4, (2, 3, 6)>
<5, (0, 7, 9)>
<6, (2, 4, -)>
<7, (1, 5, -)>
<8, (0, 1, 4)>
<9, (1, 5, -)>

There are 9 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the final answer is [9].
