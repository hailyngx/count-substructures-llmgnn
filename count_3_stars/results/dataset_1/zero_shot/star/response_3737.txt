Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 0) (5, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 1) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.  

The unique 3-stars are:  
<0, (3, 4, 8)>  
<1, (2, 5, 9)>  
<2, (1, 3, 8)>  
<2, (6, 7, 8)>
