Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 3 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The 3-stars are:

<0, (1, 5, 9)>
<3, (0, 5, 6)>
<8, (0, 6, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
