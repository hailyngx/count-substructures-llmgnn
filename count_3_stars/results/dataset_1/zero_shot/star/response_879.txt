Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph: 

<0, (3, 5, 8)>
<2, (3, 4, 8)>
<2, (3, 5, 8)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<5, (0, 2, 8)>
<8, (0, 2, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
