Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
The total number of 3-star subgraphs in the given graph can be found by counting the number of times each node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's calculate it.

Given the graph is as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to: 1 node
- Node 1 is connected to: 1 node
- Node 3 is connected to: 6 nodes
- Node 4 is connected to: 5 nodes
- Node 5 is connected to: 3 nodes
- Node 6 is connected to: 5 nodes
- Node 7 is connected to: 4 nodes
- Node 8 is connected to: 3 nodes
- Node 9 is connected to: 1 node

There are 3-star subgraphs at nodes 3, 4, and 6 since they are each connected to exactly three other nodes. Thus, the total number of 3-star subgraphs in the given graph is [3].

Unique 3-stars:
<3, (0, 6, 8)>
<4, (5, 7, 8)>
<6, (1, 3, 5)>
