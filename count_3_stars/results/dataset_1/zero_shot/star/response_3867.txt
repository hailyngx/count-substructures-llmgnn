Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 5) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
The given graph contains 5 3-stars. Here they are listed in the requested format:

1. <0, (4, 6, 8)>
2. <2, (5, 7, 9)>
3. <3, (5, 8, 9)>
4. <4, (0, 6, 8)>
5. <7, (2, 5, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
