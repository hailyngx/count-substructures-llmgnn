Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be calculated by finding all combinations of nodes connected to the center node. 

Given the edges:
(1, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8)

We can observe the following 3-stars in the graph:
<1, (7, 4, 9)>
<3, (8, 5, 6)>
<4, (7, 1, 9)>
<5, (8, 3, 6)>
<6, (8, 9, 5)>
<7, (1, 4, 9)>
<8, (3, 5, 6)>
<9, (6, 7, 8)>

There are a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
