Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are three 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are:

1. <7, (1, 6, 9)>
2. <6, (4, 7, 8)>
3. <0, (3, 5, 8)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
