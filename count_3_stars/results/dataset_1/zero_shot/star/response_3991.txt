Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 2) (7, 4) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are as follows:
- <0, (4, 3, 5)>
- <2, (6, 9, 3)>
- <9, (2, 4, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
