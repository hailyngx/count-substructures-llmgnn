Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are 3 3-stars in the given graph. 
The unique 3-stars are: 
<1, (5, 6, 7)>
<1, (5, 7, 8)>
<1, (6, 4, 7)>

Therefore, the final answer is [3].
