Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the graph can be calculated as follows:
- For each node, count the number of 3-stars that can be formed with that node as the center.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars with each node as the center:
1. Node 0: (0, 9, [__])
2. Node 1: (1, 7, 8), (1, 2, [__]) = <1, (7, 8, __)>, <1, (2, __, __)>
3. Node 2: (2, 1, 3), (2, 7, 9) = <2, (1, 3, __)>, <2, (7, 9, __)>
4. Node 3: (3, 2, [__])
5. Node 4: (4, 8, 9) = <4, (8, 9, __)>
6. Node 5: (5, 7, 8) = <5, (7, 8, __)>
7. Node 7: (7, 1, 5), (7, 2, 8) = <7, (1, 5, __)>, <7, (2, 8, __)>
8. Node 8: (8, 1, 4), (8, 7, 5) = <8, (1, 4, __)>, <8, (7, 5, __)>
9. Node 9: (9, 0, [__]), (9, 2, 4) = <9, (0, __, __)>, <9, (2, 4, __)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is: [13].
