Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<3, (0, 7, 9)>
<4, (0, 1, 6)>
<7, (0, 3, 6)>
