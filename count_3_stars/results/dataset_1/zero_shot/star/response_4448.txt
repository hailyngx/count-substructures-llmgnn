Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 3 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are:

<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<3, (0, 6, 8)>
<5, (1, 2, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
