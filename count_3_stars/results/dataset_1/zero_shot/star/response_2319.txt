Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The 3-stars are:

<0, (2, 3, 5)>
<1, (8, 9, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [2].
