Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are:

<1, (4, 5, 6)>
<2, (6, 8, 9)>
<6, (0, 1, 2)>
<8, (1, 2, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
