Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph.

The 3-stars are:
<0, (7, 8, 9)>
<1, (3, 5, 8)>
<3, (1, 6, 8)>
<4, (2, 5, 7)>
<5, (1, 4, 8)>
<7, (0, 4, 9)>
