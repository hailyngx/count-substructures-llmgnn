Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in this graph can be calculated by finding the number of occurrences of the central node in any edge and then taking the combination of 3 leaves from the remaining nodes connected to the same central node. 

Here is the list of unique 3-stars in this graph along with their central node and leaf nodes:
<0, (4, 5, 8)>
<1, (4, 5, 6)>
<2, (7, 4, 7)>
<4, (0, 1, 6)>
<5, (0, 1, 6)>
<6, (4, 7, 9)>
<7, (2, 4, 6)>
<8, (0, 4, 7)>
<9, (6, 4, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [9].
