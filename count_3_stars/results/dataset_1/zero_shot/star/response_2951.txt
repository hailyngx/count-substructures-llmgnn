Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated by finding all the sets of three nodes that are connected to a common central node. 

From the given edges, the 3-stars in the graph are as follows:
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<4, (0, 1, 5)>
<5, (0, 4, 6)>
<6, (2, 4, 5)>
<9, (0, 4, 7)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, the answer is [6].
