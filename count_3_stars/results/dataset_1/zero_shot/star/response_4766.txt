Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [<0, (1, 2, 6)>, <1, (0, 2, 4)>, <2, (0, 1, 6)>, <3, (4, 5, 7)>, <4, (1, 3, 5)>, <5, (3, 4, 7)>, <6, (0, 2, 8)>, <7, (3, 5, 9)>, <8, (1, 6, 8)>, <9, (3, 7, 9)>]. Hence, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [10].
