Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 8, 9)>
<3, (2, 4, 5)>
<4, (3, 5, 7)>
<6, (4, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 1, 5)>
<9, (0, 3, 4)>
