Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 7) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 2 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (8, 5, 8)>
<9, (4, 5, 9)>

Therefore, the final answer is [2].
