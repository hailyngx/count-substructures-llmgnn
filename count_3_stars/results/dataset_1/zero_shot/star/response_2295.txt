Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The final answer is [4].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 3, 9)>
<1, (0, 5, 9)>
<3, (0, 6, 8)>
<5, (1, 6, 7)>
