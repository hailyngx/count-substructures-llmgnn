Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph.

The 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 6, 7)>
<8, (4, 5, 9)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
