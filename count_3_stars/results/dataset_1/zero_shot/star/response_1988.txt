Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph contains the following 3-stars:
    <2, (4, 3, 5)>
    <3, (4, 2, 7)>
    <5, (2, 6, 8)>
    <6, (7, 9, 8)>
    <7, (3, 5, 6)>
    <8, (5, 6, 9)>
    <9, (0, 7, 6)>
