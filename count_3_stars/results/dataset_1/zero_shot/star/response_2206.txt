Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are a total of [4] 3-stars in the given graph.
The unique 3-stars are: <2, (3, 4, 6)>, <3, (0, 2, 9)>, <4, (1, 2, 5)>, <6, (1, 2, 7)>
