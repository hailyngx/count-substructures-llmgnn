Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in this graph can be found by first identifying the central nodes and then counting the number of unique sets of three leaves (connected to the central node) for each central node.

The central nodes are: 0, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9

For central node 0, the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<0, (3, 5, 7)>

For central node 2, the unique 3-star is:
<2, (3, 4, 5)>

For central node 4, the unique 3-star is:
<4, (2, 5, 8)>

For central node 5, the unique 3-stars are:
<5, (0, 2, 3)>
<5, (0, 2, 9)>
<5, (3, 4, 9)>

For central node 7, the unique 3-star is:
<7, (0, 4, 8)>

For central node 9, the unique 3-stars are:
<9, (1, 2, 5)>
<9, (1, 5, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is: [9].
