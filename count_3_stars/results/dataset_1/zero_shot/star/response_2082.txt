Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. Let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

1. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 3, and 9: <1, (0, 3, 9)>
2. Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 4, and 6: <3, (1, 4, 6)>
3. Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 6, and 8: <5, (3, 6, 8)>
4. Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 8, and 9: <7, (5, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
