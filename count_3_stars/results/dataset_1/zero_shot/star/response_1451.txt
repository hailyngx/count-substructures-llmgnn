Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 4) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (2, 5, 7)>
<0, (2, 8, 7)>
<1, (2, 6, 8)>
<6, (1, 8, 9)>
