Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:
[<0, (1, 4, 0)>, <1, (0, 4, 1)>]  
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
