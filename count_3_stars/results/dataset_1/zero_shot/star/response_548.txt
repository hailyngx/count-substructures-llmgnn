Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 4, 7)>
<1, (2, 4, 9)>
<2, (0, 1, 8)>
<3, (1, 8, 5)>
<4, (0, 1, 9)>
<5, (2, 6, 8)>
<6, (1, 5, 2)>
<7, (0, 2, 0)>
<8, (2, 3, 5)>
<9, (1, 4, 1)>
