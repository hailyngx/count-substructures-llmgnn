Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].  
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (5, 8, 9)>
<1, (5, 8, 0)>
<2, (3, 6, 7)>
<2, (6, 7, 8)>
<2, (7, 8, 9)>
<2, (3, 5, 9)>
