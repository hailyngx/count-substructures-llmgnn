Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the graph can be calculated as follows:

1. Identify nodes with 3 or more neighbors: Node 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 7 have at least 3 neighbors each.
2. For each of these nodes, check if they can form a 3-star.
3. Count the total number of unique 3-stars that can be formed.

Here are the steps to find the 3-stars:
1. Node 0 forms 3-stars with nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6.
2. Node 1 forms 3-stars with nodes 0, 4, 6, and 7.
3. Node 2 forms 3-stars with nodes 0, 3, and 8.
4. Node 4 forms 3-stars with nodes 0, 1, and 8.
5. Node 8 forms 3-stars with nodes 0, 2, 4, 6, and 7.
6. Node 7 forms 3-stars with nodes 1, 8, and 9.

So, the total number of unique 3-stars is 11.

Therefore, the answer is [11] and the unique 3-stars are <0, (1, 2, 3)>, <0, (1, 4, 6)>, <1, (0, 4, 6)>, <1, (4, 7, 8)>, <2, (0, 3, 8)>, <4, (0, 1, 8)>, <7, (1, 8, 9)>, and <8, (0, 2, 4)>.
