Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are two 3-stars in the given graph. The unique 3-stars are as follows:

<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<8, (5, 6, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
