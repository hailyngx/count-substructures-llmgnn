Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<0, (6, 7, 9)>
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
