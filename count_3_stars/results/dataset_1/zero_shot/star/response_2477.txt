Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to node 8.
- Node 1 is connected to node 6 and node 9.
- Node 2 is connected to node 3, node 4, node 6, and node 7.
- Node 3 is connected to node 2, node 8, and node 9.
- Node 4 is connected to node 2, node 5, and node 8.
- Node 5 is connected to node 4, node 6, and node 7.
- Node 6 is connected to node 1, node 2, node 5, and node 9.
- Node 7 is connected to node 2, node 5, and node 8.
- Node 8 is connected to node 0, node 3, node 4, and node 7.
- Node 9 is connected to node 1, node 3, and node 6.

To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify the unique 3-stars. Let's list them:
<2, (3, 6, 7)>
<3, (2, 4, 8)>
<5, (4, 6, 7)>
<6, (1, 2, 9)>
<8, (0, 4, 7)>
<9, (1, 3, 6)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we get a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
