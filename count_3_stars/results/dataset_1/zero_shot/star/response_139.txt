Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 0) (5, 8) (6, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 3 three-star graphs in the given graph. Here they are listed inside brackets:

[3]

The unique three-stars found in the graph are:

<0, (4, 9, 2)>
<8, (3, 5, 6)>
<9, (0, 2, 8)>
