Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (8, 4) (9, 1) 

Response:
There are [3] 3-stars in the given graph.  

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 6, 6)>
<1, (7, 9, 1)>
<2, (4, 8, 6)>
