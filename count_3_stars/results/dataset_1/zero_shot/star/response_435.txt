Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [2] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (4, 6, 8)>
<9, (2, 3, 4)>
