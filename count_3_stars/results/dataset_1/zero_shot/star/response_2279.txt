Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are:
[<0, (5, 7, 9)>, <2, (1, 8, 8)>, <4, (7, 9, 9)>, <5, (0, 8, 8)>, <7, (0, 3, 4)>, <8, (2, 3, 5)>, <9, (0, 4, 8)>]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
