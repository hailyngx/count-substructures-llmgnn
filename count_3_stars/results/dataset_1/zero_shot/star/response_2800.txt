Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be found by counting the number of ways we can choose a center node and three leaves connected to it. 

We can see that there are 4 potential center nodes in this graph, namely nodes 0, 1, 2, and 4. For each center node, we count the number of 3-stars it forms.

For center node 0:
- With leaves (2, 6, 8)
  
For center node 1:
- With leaves (2, 4, 8)

For center node 2:
- With leaves (0, 4, 6)
- With leaves (1, 5, 8)
- With leaves (4, 6, 7)

For center node 4:
- With leaves (1, 2, 6)
- With leaves (2, 6, 7)
- With leaves (1, 6, 7)
- With leaves (2, 4, 9)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [(1 + 1 + 3 + 4) = 9].  

Hence, the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 6, 8)>, <1, (2, 4, 8)>, <2, (0, 4, 6)>, <2, (1, 5, 8)>, <2, (4, 6, 7)>, <4, (1, 2, 6)>, <4, (2, 6, 7)>, <4, (1, 6, 7)>, <4, (2, 4, 9)>
