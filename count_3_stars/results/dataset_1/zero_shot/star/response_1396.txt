Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are a total of [3] 3-stars in the given graph.
The unique 3-stars are: 
<2, (4, 3, 5)>
<7, (2, 8, 7)>
<9, (3, 6, 9)>
