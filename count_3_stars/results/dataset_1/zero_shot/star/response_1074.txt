Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 8 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<0, (6, 7, 9)>
<2, (0, 5, 6)>
<3, (0, 5, 6)>
<6, (0, 2, 3)>
<7, (0, 4, 6)>
<8, (2, 3, 6)>
<9, (0, 5, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
