Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (6, 7, 9)>
<1, (5, 9, 0)>
<5, (1, 6, 8)>
