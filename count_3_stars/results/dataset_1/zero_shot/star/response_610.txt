Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<2, (1, 4, 6)>
<3, (6, 7, 8)>
<4, (0, 2, 5)>
<5, (7, 9, 4)>
