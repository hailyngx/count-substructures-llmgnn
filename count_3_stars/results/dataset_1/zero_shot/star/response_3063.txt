Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<1, (5, 4, 6)>
<3, (4, 6, 9)>
<4, (0, 2, 3)>
<5, (1, 4, 6)>
<9, (1, 3, 8)>
