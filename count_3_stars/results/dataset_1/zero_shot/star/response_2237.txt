This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
