Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph, which are:

<1, (4, 7, 9)>
<2, (0, 3, 4)>
<4, (1, 2, 8)>
<8, (2, 4, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
