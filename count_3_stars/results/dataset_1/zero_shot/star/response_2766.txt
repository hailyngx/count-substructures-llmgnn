Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.
  
The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (5, 9, 1)>
<5, (0, 1, 6)>
<6, (2, 5, 1)>
<9, (0, 1, 4)>
