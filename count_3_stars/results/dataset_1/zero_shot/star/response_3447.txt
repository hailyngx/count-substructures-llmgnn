Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [3] 3-stars in the given graph.  
The unique 3-stars are <0, (6, 7, 9)>, <1, (2, 3, 7)>, and <8, (1, 3, 9)>.
