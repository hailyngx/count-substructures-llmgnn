Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are listed uniquely:

<0, (2, 8, 1)>
<2, (0, 5, 7)>
<4, (3, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 4, 7)>
