Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (6, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
    
    Unique 3-stars: <0, (2, 3, 6)> <1, (4, 8, 9)>
