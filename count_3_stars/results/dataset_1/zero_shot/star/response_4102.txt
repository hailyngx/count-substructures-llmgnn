Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 2, 6)>
<0, (8, 9, 2)>
<0, (8, 9, 6)>
<3, (8, 9, 4)>
<3, (8, 9, 5)>
<8, (0, 9, 3)>
<9, (0, 8, 3)>
<9, (3, 4, 5)>
