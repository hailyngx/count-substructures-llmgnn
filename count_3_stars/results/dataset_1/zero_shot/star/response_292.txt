Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph. 
   
The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 4, 7)>
<5, (3, 4, 8)>
<6, (4, 2, 8)>
<7, (0, 4, 9)>
<8, (2, 5, 9)>
<9, (0, 5, 7)>
