Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 48 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 4, 7)>
<0, (1, 3, 6)>
<0, (2, 4, 7)>
<0, (3, 6, 9)>
<1, (0, 3, 6)>
<1, (2, 3, 8)>
<2, (1, 3, 8)>
<3, (0, 6, 9)>
<4, (0, 2, 7)>
<5, (2, 4, 7)>
<6, (0, 1, 3)>
<7, (0, 2, 4)>
