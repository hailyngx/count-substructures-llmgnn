Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [10] nodes and [34] edges in the given graph.

To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we can analyze each node to see if it is the center node of a 3-star subgraph. A 3-star subgraph is uniquely defined by its center node and the three nodes connected to it. Let's identify the 3-stars:

<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<3, (0, 2, 5)>
<4, (0, 6, 7)>
<6, (4, 8, 9)>

Therefore, there are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.
