Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<1, (0, 5, 8)>
<6, (2, 3, 9)>
<5, (0, 1, 6)>
