Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 3-stars in this graph. Here they are:
[<0, (1, 3, 8)>, <1, (0, 2, 4)>, <2, (1, 5, 7)>, <8, (0, 2, 9)>]
