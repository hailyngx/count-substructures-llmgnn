Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:
1. <0, (1, 5, 8)>
2. <1, (0, 5, 3)>
3. <2, (4, 6, 9)>
4. <3, (1, 7, -)>
5. <4, (2, 7, -)>
6. <5, (0, 1, 8)>
7. <6, (2, 8, 9)>
8. <7, (3, 4, 9)>
9. <8, (0, 5, 6)>
10. <9, (2, 5, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
