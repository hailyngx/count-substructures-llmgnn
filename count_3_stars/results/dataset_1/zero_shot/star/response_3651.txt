Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list out the unique 3-stars below:

[<0, (1, 2, 3)>, <3, (0, 1, 2)>, <4, (3, 7, 8)>, <5, (4, 6, 9)>, <6, (0, 1, 5)>, <7, (1, 4, 6)>, <9, (5, 6, 8)>]

Count: [7]
