Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are \[4\] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 6, 7)>
<3, (2, 4, 5)>
<4, (0, 3, 6)>
<5, (1, 3, 9)>
