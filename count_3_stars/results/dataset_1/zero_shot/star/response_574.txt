Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of [4] 3-stars in the given graph.  

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<1, (0, 2, 5)>
<4, (0, 7, 8)>
<8, (1, 6, 9)>
