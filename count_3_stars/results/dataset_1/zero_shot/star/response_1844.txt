Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (2, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<4, (0, 1, 8)>
<5, (0, 6, 9)>
