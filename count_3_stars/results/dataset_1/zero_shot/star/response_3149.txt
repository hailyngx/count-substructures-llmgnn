Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<0, (1, 7, 8)>
<4, (0, 1, 6)>
<4, (1, 2, 6)>
<4, (0, 2, 6)>
<6, (0, 4, 8)>
<6, (4, 5, 8)>
<7, (0, 6, 8)>
