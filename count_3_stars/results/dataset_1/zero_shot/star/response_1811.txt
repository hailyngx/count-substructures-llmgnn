Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 8, 1)>
<1, (4, 8, 6)>
<2, (0, 9, 7)>
<3, (5, 8, None)>
<4, (1, 7, 8)>
<6, (1, 7, 8)>
<8, (0, 1, 3)>
<9, (6, 8, 2)>
