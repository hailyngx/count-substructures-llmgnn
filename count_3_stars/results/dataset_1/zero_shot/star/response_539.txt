Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
The 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 3, 8)>
<6, (7, 9, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
