Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
In this graph, there are three 3-stars:

1. <2, (3, 4, 9)>
2. <4, (2, 3, 7)>
3. <8, (0, 6, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
