Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (4, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are a total of [4] 3-stars in the given graph. 
The unique 3-stars are:
<2, (0, 1, 5)>
<2, (1, 5, 7)>
<6, (3, 5, 9)>
<6, (8, 1, 9)>
