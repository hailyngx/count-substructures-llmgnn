Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 3) (3, 2) (4, 0) (5, 0) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
    
The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<1, (0, 7, 8)>
<2, (3, 6, 9)>
<3, (2, 6, 9)>
<6, (7, 8, 9)>
<7, (0, 1, 8)>
