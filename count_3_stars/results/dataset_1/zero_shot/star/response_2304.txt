Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) 

Response:
There are [2] 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<1, (6, 8, 4)>
