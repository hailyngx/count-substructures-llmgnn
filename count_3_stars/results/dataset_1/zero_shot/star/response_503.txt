Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (8, 4) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are 8 total 3-star configurations in the given graph. Here they are:
    - <0, (5, 7, 1)>
    - <1, (2, 5, 0)>
    - <2, (1, 5, 6)>
    - <3, (5, 6, 4)>
    - <4, (5, 8, 9)>
    - <5, (0, 1, 2)>
    - <6, (2, 3, 5)>
    - <7, (0, 5, 3)>

Therefore, the final answer is: [8].
