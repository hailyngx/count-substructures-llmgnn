Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (2, 0, 5)>
<1, (2, 5, 6)>
<2, (1, 5, 8)>
<2, (3, 7, 8)>
<3, (2, 7, 8)>
<5, (1, 2, 6)>
