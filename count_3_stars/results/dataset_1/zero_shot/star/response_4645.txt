Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are a total of [4] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<1, (3, 9, 5)>
<3, (1, 5, 7)>
<6, (4, 5, 9)>
