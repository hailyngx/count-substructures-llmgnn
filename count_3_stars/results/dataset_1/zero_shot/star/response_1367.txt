Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are four 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<1, (0, 6, 8)>
<2, (3, 4, 8)>
<3, (2, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
