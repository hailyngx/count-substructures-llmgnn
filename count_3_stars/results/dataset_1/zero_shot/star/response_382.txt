Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.  
The unique 3-stars found are:  
<0, (2, 5, 6)>  
<0, (2, 5, 8)>  
<0, (6, 8, 5)>  
<8, (0, 6, 7)>
