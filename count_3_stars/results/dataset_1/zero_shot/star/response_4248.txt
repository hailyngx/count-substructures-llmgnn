Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<1, (0, 5, 7)>
<4, (7, 5, 9)>
<8, (1, 5, 9)>
