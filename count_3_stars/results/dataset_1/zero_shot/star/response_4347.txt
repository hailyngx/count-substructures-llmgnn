Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

The 3-stars are:
<2, (3, 4, 9)>
<3, (2, 5, 8)>
<4, (2, 5, 6)>
<5, (1, 3, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
