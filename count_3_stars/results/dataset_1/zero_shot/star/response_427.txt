Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is 1. The unique 3-star found is <9, (2, 3, 6)>. Therefore, the final answer is [1].
