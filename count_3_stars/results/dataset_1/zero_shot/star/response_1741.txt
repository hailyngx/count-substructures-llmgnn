Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The graph has 3-star structures on the following central nodes:  
<0, (1, 3, 4)>  
<1, (0, 4, 5)>  
<4, (0, 1, 9)>  
<5, (1, 6, -)>  
<6, (5, 8, -)>  
<8, (0, 2, 6)>  
<9, (4, 7, 8)>  

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
