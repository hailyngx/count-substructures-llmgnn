Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:
[<0, (3, 8, 9)>, <1, (3, 5, 6)>, <2, (3, 9, 9)>, <3, (0, 1, 2)>, <5, (1, 4, 7)>, <6, (1, 8, 8)>, <7, (5, 9, 9)>, <8, (0, 5, 6)>, <9, (0, 2, 7)>]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
