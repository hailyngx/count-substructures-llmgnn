Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
There are 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph.  
The 3-stars are:  
<0, (2, 8, 9)>  
<4, (0, 3, 8)>  

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
