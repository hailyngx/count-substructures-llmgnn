Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are three 3-stars in the given graph. The unique 3-stars are listed below:
    
    <0, (2, 5, 6)>
    <1, (3, 8, 9)>
    <2, (0, 4, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
