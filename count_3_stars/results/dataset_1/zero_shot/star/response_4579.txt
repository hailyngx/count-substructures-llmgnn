Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are [8] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars in the graph are:
<0, (7, 9, 4)>
<4, (7, 2, 3)>
<1, (4, 2, 3)>
<2, (4, 1, 3)>
<3, (4, 1, 2)>
<7, (0, 4, 9)>
<9, (0, 7, 5)>
<5, (9, 2, 6)>
