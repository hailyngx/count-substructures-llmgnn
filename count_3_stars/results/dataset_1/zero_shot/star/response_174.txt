Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be counted by looking at nodes with three edges emanating from them. In this case, nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, and 9 are eligible to be the center of a 3-star.

After considering all possible 3-star configurations, we can see that there are <0, (5, 7, 9)>, <1, (2, 6, 8)>, and <2, (1, 3, 6)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
