Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
There are 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph.  

The 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<2, (4, 6, 7)> 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [2].
