Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.  

The unique 3-stars are <0, (6, 8, 9)>, <2, (6, 8, 9)>, <8, (0, 2, 9)>, and <9, (0, 2, 8)>.
