Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 6) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (5, 7, 9)>
<4, (6, 7, 9)>
<5, (0, 7, 8)>
<6, (2, 4, 8)>
