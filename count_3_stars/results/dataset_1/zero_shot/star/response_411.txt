Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The list of 3-stars is as follows:

<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<1, (0, 9, 4)>
<2, (5, 8, 9)>
<4, (0, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
