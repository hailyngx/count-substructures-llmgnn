Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The total number of 3-star structures in the given graph can be calculated by counting the number of length-2 walks starting from each node and then summing them up. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars in the graph.

Based on the given edges, we have the following 3-stars:
- <1, (3, 6)>
- <2, (4, 7, 9)>
- <3, (1, 5, 6)>
- <4, (2, 5, 9)>
- <5, (3, 4, 8)>
- <6, (1, 3, 8)>
- <7, (2, 8)>
- <8, (5, 6, 7)>
- <9, (2, 4, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
