Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.  
The unique 3-stars are <0, (1, 5, 9)>, <1, (0, 2, 8)>, <5, (0, 9, 5)>, and <8, (1, 3, 6)>.
