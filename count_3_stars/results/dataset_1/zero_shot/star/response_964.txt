Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [5] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 9, 4)>
<1, (5, 7, 8)>
<2, (0, 4, 6)>
<4, (2, 5, 6)>
<7, (1, 3, 8)>
