Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-star subgraphs in the given graph. 

The 3-star subgraphs are:
<0, (6, 8, 3)>
<2, (1, 4, 7)>
<5, (4, 6, 7)>
<7, (1, 9, 2)>
