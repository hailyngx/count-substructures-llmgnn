Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [8] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 7, 1)>
<2, (0, 3, 7)>
<3, (2, 8, 8)>
<4, (8, 9, 9)>
<5, (6, 7, 8)>
<6, (5, 5, 5)>
<7, (0, 1, 9)>
<8, (3, 4, 5)>
