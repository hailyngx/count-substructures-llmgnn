Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph is as follows:

Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 6, and 9.  
Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, and 8.  
Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 5, and 8.  
Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, and 9.  
Node 4 is connected to node 5.  
Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 6.  
Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 5, and 9.  
Node 7 is connected to node 8.  
Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 7.  
Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 6.

There are no nodes in the graph which have exactly three neighbors. Now, we will count the number of 3-stars in the graph.

Let's check for each node if it is the center of a 3-star.

- Node 0: (0, 1, 3, 6), (0, 1, 3, 9), (0, 3, 6, 9) -> 3 3-stars
- Node 1: (1, 0, 2, 3), (1, 0, 3, 8), (1, 2, 3, 8) -> 3 3-stars
- Node 2: (2, 1, 3, 5), (2, 1, 5, 8), (2, 3, 5, 8) -> 3 3-stars
- Node 3: (3, 0, 1, 2), (3, 0, 1, 9), (3, 1, 2, 9) -> 3 3-stars
- Node 4: N/A -> 0 3-stars
- Node 5: (5, 2, 4, 6), (5, 2, 6, 4) -> 2 3-stars
- Node 6: (6, 0, 5, 9), (6, 0, 9, 5) -> 2 3-stars
- Node 7: N/A -> 0 3-stars
- Node 8: N/A -> 0 3-stars
- Node 9: N/A -> 0 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 3 (from node 0) + 3 (from node 1) + 3 (from node 2) + 3 (from node 3) + 2 (from node 5) + 2 (from node 6) + 0 (from nodes 4, 7, 8, 9) = 16.

Therefore, the final answer is [16] and the unique 3-stars found are <0, (1, 3, 6)>, <5, (2, 4, 6)>.
