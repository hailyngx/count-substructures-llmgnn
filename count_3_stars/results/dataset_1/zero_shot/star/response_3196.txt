Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 5 unique 3-stars in this graph. Here they are:

<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<0, (3, 6, 8)>
<0, (4, 6, 8)>
<2, (0, 5, 6)>
<3, (0, 7, 9)> 
  
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
