Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [2] unique 3-stars in the given graph. They are:
<0, (5, 6, 8)>
<7, (1, 5, 8)>
