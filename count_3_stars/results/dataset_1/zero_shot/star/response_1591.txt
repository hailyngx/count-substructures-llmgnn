Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 8, 1)>
<1, (3, 4, 5)>
<2, (4, 5, 8)>
<3, (1, 4, 6)>
<4, (0, 1, 2)>
<5, (1, 2, 4)>
