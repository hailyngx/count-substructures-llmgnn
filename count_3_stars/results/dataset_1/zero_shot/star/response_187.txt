Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].  

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (2, 4, 7)>
<3, (1, 4, 9)>
<4, (1, 2, 3)>
<6, (3, 5, 8)>
<8, (4, 6, 8)>
<9, (3, 5, 9)>
