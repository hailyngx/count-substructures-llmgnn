Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are listed below:

<0, (2, 6, 0)>
<2, (0, 3, 5)>
<3, (1, 2, 8)>
<6, (0, 2, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
