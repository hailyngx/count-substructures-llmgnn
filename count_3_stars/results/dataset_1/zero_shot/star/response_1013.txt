Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be calculated by finding all possible combinations of a central node and 3 other nodes that are connected to it. 

To do this, we first identify each node that is connected to exactly 3 other nodes in the graph. These nodes can act as potential centers of 3-stars. We then list out the nodes that are connected to each potential center to form a 3-star.

Given the edges provided, the nodes that are connected to exactly 3 other nodes are: 2, 3, and 4. 

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
1. For node 2: (2, 1, 4, 6), (2, 1, 5, 9)
2. For node 3: (3, 0, 1, 4), (3, 0, 5, 7), (3, 1, 4, 8)
3. For node 4: (4, 0, 1, 8), (4, 0, 2, 3), (4, 1, 2, 8)

Combining these unique 3-stars found, we get:
<2, (1, 4, 6)>, <2, (1, 5, 9)>, <3, (0, 1, 4)>, <3, (0, 5, 7)>, <3, (1, 4, 8)>, <4, (0, 1, 8)>, <4, (0, 2, 3)>, <4, (1, 2, 8)>.

Therefore, the final answer is: [8].
