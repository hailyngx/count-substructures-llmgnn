Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph contains the following 3-stars:
[<0, (1, 5, 8)>, <1, (0, 5, 8)>, <2, (6, 7, 5)>, <3, (5, 8, 0)>, <4, (5, 7, 5)>, <5, (0, 1, 9)>, <6, (2, 5, 5)>, <7, (2, 4, 9)>, <8, (0, 1, 7)>, <9, (5, 7, 5)>]
So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
