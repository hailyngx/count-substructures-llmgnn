Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (8, 3) (9, 3) 

Response:
The 3-star graphs found in the given graph are:
<1, (7, 3, 9)>
<2, (3, 4, 6)>
<3, (2, 4, 8)>
<3, (4, 8, 9)>  
Therefore, the total number of 3-star in the graph is [4].
