Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 12 unique 3-stars found in this graph. The answer is [12].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 4, 9)>
<2, (0, 6, 7)>
<4, (0, 3, 6)>
<6, (2, 4, 8)>
<7, (2, 8, 9)>
<8, (6, 7, 9)>
<9, (1, 2, 4)>
<9, (5, 7, 8)>
<9, (2, 4, 7)>
<9, (5, 6, 8)>
<9, (1, 7, 8)>
<9, (2, 5, 7)>
