Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (2, 0) (2, 8) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 5 non-overlapping 3-stars in the given graph. The unique 3-stars are as follows: <0, (2, 6, 7)>, <2, (0, 8, 8)>, <5, (7, 7, -)>, <6, (0, 7, 7)>, <9, (8, -, -)>. Therefore, the final answer is [5].
