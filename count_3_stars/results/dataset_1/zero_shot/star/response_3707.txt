Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph contains the following 3-stars:
[<0, (2, 7, 8)>, <1, (2, 6, 8)>, <2, (0, 1, 9)>, <6, (1, 3, 5)>, <7, (0, 4, 9)>, <9, (2, 4, 7)>]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
