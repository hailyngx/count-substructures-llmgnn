Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (5, 6, 8)>
<3, (4, 6, 7)>
<4, (1, 7, 8)>
<7, (2, 4, 6)>
