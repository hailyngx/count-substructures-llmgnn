Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-star subgraphs in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-star subgraphs are:
<0, (2, 5, 7)>
<1, (3, 5, 6)>
<3, (1, 4, 6)>
<8, (0, 4, 9)>
