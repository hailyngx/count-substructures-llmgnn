Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 8 unique 3-stars in the given graph:  

<0, (3, 4, 8)>  
<2, (3, 5, 6)>  
<3, (0, 2, 4)>  
<4, (0, 3, 5)>  
<5, (2, 4, 9)>  
<6, (2, 3, 9)>  
<7, (4, 8, 9)>  
<8, (0, 1, 6)>  

Therefore, there are [8] 3-stars in the graph.
