Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (5, 9, 2)>
<1, (4, 8, 9)>
<2, (5, 0, 6)>
<3, (4, 6, 7)>
<4, (1, 3, 8)>
<5, (0, 2, 7)>
<6, (2, 3, 7)>
<7, (3, 5, 9)>
<8, (1, 4, 5)>
