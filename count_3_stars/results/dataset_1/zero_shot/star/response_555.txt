Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are <0, (4, 5, 7)>, <2, (3, 4, 6)>, and <5, (4, 7, 9)> 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
