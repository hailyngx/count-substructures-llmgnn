Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 5, 8)>
<1, (3, 7, 9)>
<2, (4, 5, 8)>
<8, (3, 9, 2)>
