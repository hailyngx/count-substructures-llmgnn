Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<1, (0, 3, 7)>
<2, (0, 3, 4)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<4, (0, 2, 3)>
<6, (7, 8, 9)>
<7, (1, 4, 6)>
<8, (1, 4, 6)>
