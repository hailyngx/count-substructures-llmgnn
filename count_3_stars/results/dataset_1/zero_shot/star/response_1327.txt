Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are as follows:
<0, (2, 3, 2)>
<2, (0, 3, 5)>
<2, (3, 0, 6)>
<2, (5, 6, 5)>
<2, (6, 5, 7)>
<2, (7, 9, 2)>
<3, (0, 2, 0)>
<5, (2, 6, 2)>
<5, (6, 2, 7)>
<6, (2, 5, 2)>
<7, (1, 4, 2)>
<7, (4, 5, 7)>
<7, (5, 8, 7)>
<7, (9, 2, 7)>
