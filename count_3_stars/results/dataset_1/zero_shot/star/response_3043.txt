Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 7 unique 3-stars in the given graph: 
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<2, (0, 1, 4)>
<2, (1, 4, 8)>
<2, (3, 6, 9)>
<2, (5, 8, 9)>
<3, (0, 2, 4)>
<8, (2, 4, 5)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
