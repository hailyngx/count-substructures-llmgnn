Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<1, (2, 3, 7)>
<3, (1, 4, 6)>
<4, (0, 2, 3)>
