Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 3-star subgraphs in the given graph. Let's list and count them:

1. <0, (1, 3, 5)>
2. <1, (0, 2, 3)>
3. <2, (1, 3, 6)>
4. <3, (0, 1, 2)>
5. <4, (5, 7, 9)>
6. <5, (0, 4, 8)>
7. <6, (0, 2, 7)>
8. <7, (0, 1, 3)>
9. <8, (5, 9, -)>
10. <9, (4, 8, -)>

Therefore, there are a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
