Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The <0, (4, 5, 7)>, <2, (3, 4, 8)>, and <6, (1, 2, 4)> are the unique 3-stars in this graph. Therefore, there are [3] 3-stars in total.
