Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are no 3-star configurations in the given graph. The center node must have exactly three other nodes connected to it, but in this case, there are nodes with different degrees, making it impossible to form a 3-star. 

Thus, the answer is: [0]
