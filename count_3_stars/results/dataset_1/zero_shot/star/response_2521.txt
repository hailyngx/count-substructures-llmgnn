Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph contains the following 3-stars:
[<0, (1, 7, 9)>, <1, (0, 4, 5)>, <2, (3, 4, -)>, <3, (2, 7, 9)>, <4, (1, 2, 8)>, <6, (7, -, -)>, <8, (4, 9, -)>, <9, (0, 3, 8)>]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
