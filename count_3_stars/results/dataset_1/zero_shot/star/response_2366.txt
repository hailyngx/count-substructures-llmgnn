Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph. The unique 3-stars are <0, (1, 5, 7)>, <1, (0, 7, 8)>, <1, (7, 8, 9)>, <2, (5, 9, 0)>, <5, (0, 2, 8)>, and <7, (0, 1, 9)>.
