Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
There are a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 4, 8)>
<1, (2, 5, 6)>
<3, (0, 5, 7)>
<4, (0, 8, 5)>
<5, (1, 2, 3)>
<7, (3, 6, 8)>
