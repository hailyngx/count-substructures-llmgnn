Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.

<0, (1, 2, 6)>
<2, (0, 7, 8)>
<3, (4, 8, 9)>
<6, (0, 4, 7)>
