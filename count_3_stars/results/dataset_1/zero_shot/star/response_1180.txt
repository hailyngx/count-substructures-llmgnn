Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.

<0, (1, 8, 9)>
<1, (0, 2, 9)>
<2, (1, 5, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 2)>
