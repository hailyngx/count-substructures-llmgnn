Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.  
The unique 3-stars found are <0, (3, 5, 6)>, <2, (1, 3, 6)>, <3, (0, 2, 6)>, and <6, (0, 2, 4)>.
