Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

The 3-stars are:
<0, (8, 9, -)>
<1, (3, 8, -)>
<2, (6, 7, -)>
<3, (1, 4, 8)>

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
