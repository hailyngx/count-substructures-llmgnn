Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 7) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
The graph can be visually represented as follows:

```
0 --- 3
|     |
|     |
2 --- 8 --- 6 --- 1 --- 7 --- 4
|     |     |     |     |     |
|     |     |     |     |     |
3 --- 2     8     6     1     7 --- 5
                  |           |
                  |           |
                  1 --- 7 --- 5
                        |
                        |
                        9
```

To count the number of 3-stars, we need to identify the 3-stars in the graph. Here, the 3-star patterns are as follows:

1. <1, (6, 8, 7)>
2. <3, (0, 2, 8)>
3. <5, (7, 9, 1)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
