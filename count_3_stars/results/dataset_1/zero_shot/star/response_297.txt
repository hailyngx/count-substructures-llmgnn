Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in this given graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (3, 8, 6)>
<1, (5, 9, 6)>
<2, (4, 5, 7)>
<3, (0, 8, 6)>
<6, (4, 5, 8)>
<7, (5, 4, 8)>
