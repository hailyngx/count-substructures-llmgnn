Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 1) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are a total of [8] unique 3-stars in this graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<3, (2, 4, 9)>
<4, (3, 9, 2)>
<1, (5, 6, -1)>
<2, (0, 3, -2)>
<5, (1, 6, -1)>
<6, (1, 5, -1)>
<9, (3, 4, -3)>
