Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here is the list of unique 3-stars:

<0, (3, 5, 9)>
<2, (7, 9, 4)>
<4, (7, 8, 6)>
<5, (6, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
