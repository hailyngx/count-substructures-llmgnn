Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 4 3-stars in the given graph. 
The unique 3-stars are <0, (4, 5, 9)>, <1, (6, 7, 9)>, <2, (7, 9, 0)>, and <3, (4, 6, 8)>.
Therefore, the final answer is [4].
