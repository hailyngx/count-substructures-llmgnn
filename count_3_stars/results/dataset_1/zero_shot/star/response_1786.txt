Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 3-star configurations in the given graph. Here is the list of unique 3-stars:

<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<4, (5, 6, 8)>
<8, (1, 3, 4)>
<9, (0, 2, 4)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
