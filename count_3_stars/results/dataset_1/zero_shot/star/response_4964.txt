Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are <0, (2, 5, 6)> and <5, (0, 2, 8)> as the 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
