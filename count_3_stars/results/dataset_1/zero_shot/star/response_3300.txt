Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are as follows: 

[<1, (6, 7, 8)>, <2, (6, 7, 9)>, <5, (3, 4, 7)>]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
