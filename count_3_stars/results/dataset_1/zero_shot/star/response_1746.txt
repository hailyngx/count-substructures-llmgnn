Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
There are 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Below is the list of 3-stars:

<0, (8, 9)>  
<4, (1, 7, 8)>  

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
