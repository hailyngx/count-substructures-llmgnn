Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated by examining each node and counting how many 3-star structures it is a part of. 

In this graph, the 3-stars are as follows:
<0, (6, 7, 9)>
<2, (7, 8, 0)>
<3, (4, 6, 7)>
<4, (3, 5, 7)>
<5, (4, 8, 7)>
<6, (0, 3, 9)>
<7, (0, 2, 3)>
<8, (5, 7, 0)>
<9, (6, 0, x)>, <x, (9, y, z)>
   
Therefore, there are 9 unique 3-stars in this graph. So, the answer is [9].
