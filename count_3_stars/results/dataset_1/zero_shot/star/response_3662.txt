Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<1, (3, 5, 7)>
<3, (1, 4, 8)>
<4, (0, 3, 5)>
<5, (1, 4, 7)>
<7, (1, 4, 8)>
