Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 3 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the output is: 

\[3\] 

The unique 3-stars are:

<0, (6, 7, 1)>
<3, (4, 5, 6)>
<5, (1, 2, 9)>
