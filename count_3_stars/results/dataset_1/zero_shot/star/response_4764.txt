Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph. 

<1, (4, 5, 6)>
<3, (2, 4, 5)>
<3, (2, 5, 6)>
<7, (1, 2, 8)>
