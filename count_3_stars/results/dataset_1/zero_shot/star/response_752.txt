Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are listed below:

<0, (2, 4, 8)>
<1, (2, 5, 7)>
<2, (0, 1, 7)>
<3, (6, 8, 9)>
<4, (0, 5, 7)>
<5, (1, 4, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
