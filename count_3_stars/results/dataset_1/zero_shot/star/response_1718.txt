Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
The 3-stars are: 
<0, (4, 7, 9)>
<2, (1, 3, 6)>
<3, (1, 2, 5)>
<5, (3, 4, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
