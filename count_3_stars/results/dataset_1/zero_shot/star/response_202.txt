Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are <0, (1, 5, 7)>, <0, (7, 8, 9)>, <1, (0, 4, 9)>, and <9, (3, 6, 7)>.
