Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.  

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<2, (4, 5, 7)>
<3, (5, 6, 7)>
<8, (2, 9, 7)>
