Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [16].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<1, (0, 6, 7)>
<2, (0, 3, 9)>
<3, (0, 2, 9)>
<4, (0, 5, 7)>
<5, (0, 4, 9)>
<6, (1, 0, 8)>
<7, (1, 4, 9)>
<8, (2, 6, 9)>
<9, (2, 5, 6)>
