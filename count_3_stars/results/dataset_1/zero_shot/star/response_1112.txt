Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 2) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (6, 4, 8)>
<2, (0, 4, 9)>
<6, (1, 3, 8)>
