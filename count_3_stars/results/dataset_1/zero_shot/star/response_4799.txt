Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.

<0, (2, 4, 9)>
<2, (0, 1, 5)>
<4, (0, 8, 9)>
<8, (2, 4, 5)>
