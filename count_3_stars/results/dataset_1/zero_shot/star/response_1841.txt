Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 5) 

Response:
The unique 3-stars found in the given graph are:
1. <0, (1, 7, 2)>
2. <1, (0, 3, 4)>
3. <2, (3, 4, 5)>
4. <3, (1, 2, 4)>
5. <4, (1, 2, 3)>
6. <5, (1, 2, 8)>
7. <7, (0, 1, 2)>
8. <8, (2, 3, 5)>  

Counting the number of 3-stars in the graph, we get a total of [8].
