Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are a total of 6 3-stars in this graph. Here they are listed inside <>:

<0, (7, 5, 8)>
<1, (2, 3, 8)>
<2, (1, 3, 6)>
<5, (6, 7, 8)>
<6, (2, 5, 7)>
<8, (1, 3, 5)>

Therefore, the final count of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
