Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are a total of 6 unique 3-star structures in the given graph. The count is within brackets [].

<0, (2, 5, 8)>
<0, (5, 8, 9)>
<1, (6, 7, 9)>
<2, (0, 4, 5)>
<3, (4, 8, 9)>
<4, (2, 3, 5)>
