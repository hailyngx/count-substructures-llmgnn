Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph.  

The 3-stars are:  
<1, (3, 6, 8)>  
<3, (1, 6, 7)>  
<6, (1, 3, 7)>  
<7, (3, 6, 8)>  
<8, (1, 6, 7)>  
<9, (0, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
