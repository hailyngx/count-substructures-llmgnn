Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are:
<0, (3, 4, 6)>
<1, (3, 7, 8)>
<2, (4, 8, 0)>
<3, (0, 1, 5)>
<4, (0, 2, 8)>
<8, (1, 2, 5)>

So, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
