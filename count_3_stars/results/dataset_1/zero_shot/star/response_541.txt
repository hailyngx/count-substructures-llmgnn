Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are:

<0, (4, 5, 8)>
<1, (4, 6, 8)>
<2, (4, 6, 7)>
<3, (4, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
