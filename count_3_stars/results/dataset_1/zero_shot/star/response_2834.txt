Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in this graph.  
The unique 3-stars are <0, (4, 8, 9)>, <2, (5, 6, 8)>, <3, (5, 7, 9)>, <5, (2, 3, 7)>, <6, (1, 2, 8)>, and <8, (0, 6, 9)>.
