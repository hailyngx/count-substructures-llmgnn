Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-star subgraphs in the given graph.  
The unique 3-stars are <0, (7, 8, 1)>, <1, (4, 7, 8)>, <2, (3, 7, 4)>, and <3, (2, 4, 5)>.
