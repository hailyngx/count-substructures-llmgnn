Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are:
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<1, (3, 4, 9)>
<2, (8, 9, "")>
<3, (0, 1, 6)>
<4, (0, 1, 5)>
<5, (0, 4, "")>
<6, (3, 4, "")>
<8, (0, 2, "")>
<9, (1, 2, 7)>

So, there are a total of [9] 3-stars in the graph.
