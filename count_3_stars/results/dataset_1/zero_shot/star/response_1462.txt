Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 1) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-star structures:
    - <1, (2, 4, 5)>
    - <2, (1, 6, 7)>
    - <6, (2, 3, 7)>
    - <9, (5, 8, 1)> 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
