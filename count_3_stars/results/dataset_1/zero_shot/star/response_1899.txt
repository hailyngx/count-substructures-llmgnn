Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 3, 8)>
<1, (0, 4, 6)>
<3, (0, 2, 8)>
<4, (1, 5, 6)>
<5, (4, 6, 7)>
<7, (5, 6, 8)>
