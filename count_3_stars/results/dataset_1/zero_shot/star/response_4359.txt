Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:

[<0, (1, 2, 6)>, <1, (0, 6, 9)>, <2, (0, 4, 5)>, <3, (6, 8, 9)>, <4, (2, 5, 6)>, <5, (2, 4, 9)>, <6, (1, 3, 4)>, <8, (3, 5, 6)>, <9, (1, 3, 5)>]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
