Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 3 3-stars in the given graph. The unique 3-stars are:

<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<1, (0, 5, 8)>
<9, (1, 3, 6)>

Therefore, the final answer is [3].
