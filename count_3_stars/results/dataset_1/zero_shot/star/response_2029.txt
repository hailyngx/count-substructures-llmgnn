Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are 5 3-stars in the given graph. 
The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 6, 7)>
<1, (3, 6, 8)>
<2, (3, 9, 4)>
<3, (1, 2, 4)>
<4, (0, 3, 8)>
Therefore, the final answer is [5].
