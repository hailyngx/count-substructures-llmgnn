Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph.

<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<3, (0, 7, 8)>
<3, (4, 7, 8)>
<4, (2, 3, 9)>
<7, (0, 3, 6)>
<9, (3, 4, 7)>
