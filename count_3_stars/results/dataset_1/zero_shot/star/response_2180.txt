Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of 5 three-star subgraphs in the given graph. Here they are listed in unique form with the center node and leaf nodes specified within parentheses:

[<0, (1, 4, 5)>, <1, (0, 2, 6)>, <2, (1, 5, 7)>, <3, (4, 6, 8)>, <8, (1, 3, 6)>]
