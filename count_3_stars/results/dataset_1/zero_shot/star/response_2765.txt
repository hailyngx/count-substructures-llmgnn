Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are:

<0, (2, 3, 5)>
<3, (0, 5, 7)>
<5, (0, 3, 9)>
<8, (1, 2, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
