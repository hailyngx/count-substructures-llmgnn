Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 3 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are:
<0, (5, 6, 8)>
<4, (3, 5, 6)>
<6, (0, 1, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
