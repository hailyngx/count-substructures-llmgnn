Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph. 
The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (4, 2, 7)>
<1, (3, 8, 8)>
<2, (4, 8, 9)>
<3, (1, 4, 1)>
<4, (0, 7, 2)>
<8, (1, 9, 2)>
