Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<1, (0, 7, 9)>
<2, (5, 6, 8)>
<9, (1, 2, 4)>
