Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The list is as follows:

[<0, (6, 8, 0)>, <1, (6, 7, 8)>, <2, (3, 4, 5)>, <5, (4, 8, 9)>]
