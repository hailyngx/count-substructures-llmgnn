Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph.  

The unique 3-stars found are:  
<0, (1, 2, 3)>  
<1, (0, 4, 5)>  
<2, (0, 3, 7)>  
<3, (2, 5, 7)>  
<4, (1, 6, 9)>  
<5, (1, 3, 9)>
