Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are a total of [12] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (2, 6, 7)>
<2, (0, 7, 9)>
<4, (1, 5, 6)>
<5, (1, 3, 9)>
<6, (0, 3, 8)>
<7, (2, 4, 6)>
<1, (4, 5, 8)>
