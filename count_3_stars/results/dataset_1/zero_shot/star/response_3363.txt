Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 1) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph. The unique 3-stars are as follows:
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<1, (0, 2, 5)>
<2, (1, 5, 8)>
<3, (4, 6, 7)>
