Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The center of the 3-star graph can be any node in the given graph. We will now list out all the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (2, 6, 9)>
<1, (2, 4, 7)>
<2, (0, 1, 9)>
<3, (1, 4, 5)>
<4, (1, 3, 7)>
<5, (3, 6, 9)>
<6, (0, 3, 4)>
<7, (1, 4, 6)>
<8, (4, 7, 9)>
<9, (2, 4, 8)>

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
