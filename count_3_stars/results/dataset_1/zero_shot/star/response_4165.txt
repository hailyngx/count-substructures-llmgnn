Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 6) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The graph contains a total of 4 different 3-stars. Here they are listed inside <>:

<3, (2, 4, 6)>
<4, (0, 3, 9)>
<6, (1, 3, 9)>
<9, (3, 4, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
