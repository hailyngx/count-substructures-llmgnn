Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 8) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<1, (2, 8, 9)>
<2, (1, 4, 5)>
<4, (0, 2, 8)>
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
