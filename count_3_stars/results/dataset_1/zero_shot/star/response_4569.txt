Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph.

The 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 6, 9)>
<2, (0, 3, 8)>
<3, (0, 5, 6)>
<6, (0, 3, 8)>
<8, (2, 6, 8)>
<9, (0, 3, 9)>
