Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The given graph contains the following 3-stars:
[<0, (8, 9)>]

Hence, the total number of 3-stars is [1].
