Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are:
<0, (1, 2, 7)>
<1, (0, 3, 5)>
<2, (0, 6, 9)>
<7, (0, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
