Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 3-stars in the given graph. Here is the list of unique 3-stars found within the graph:

<0, (5, 6, 7)>
<2, (4, 6, 7)>
<4, (2, 5, 9)>
<5, (0, 4, 7)>
<6, (0, 2, 9)>
<7, (0, 2, 3)>
<9, (1, 4, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
