Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (2, 7, 6)>
<1, (2, 7, 9)>
<1, (3, 6, 8)>
<1, (3, 7, 9)>
