Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 1) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (6, 8, 2)>
<2, (5, 6, 8)>
<3, (1, 7, 8)>
<7, (5, 3, 8)>
