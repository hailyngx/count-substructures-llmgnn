Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 8 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are:

<0, (5, 1, 2)>
<1, (4, 5, 7)>
<2, (4, 5, 7)>
<3, (9, 4, 6)>
<4, (1, 2, 9)>
<5, (0, 1, 2)>
<6, (2, 9, 5)>
<7, (1, 2, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
