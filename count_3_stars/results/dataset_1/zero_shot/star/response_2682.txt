Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) 

Response:
There are 3 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
The count of 3-stars is [3].
The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<3, (0, 4, 5)>
<4, (3, 6, 8)>
