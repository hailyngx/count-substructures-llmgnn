Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are [12] 3-stars in the given graph.
The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 9, 5)>
<1, (0, 9, 5)>
<1, (3, 5, 6)>
<1, (5, 9, 0)>
<2, (7, 9, 8)>
<3, (1, 6, 8)>
<3, (4, 6, 8)>
<5, (1, 9, 0)>
<6, (1, 3, 7)>
<7, (1, 2, 6)>
<8, (2, 3, 6)>
<9, (0, 1, 5)>
