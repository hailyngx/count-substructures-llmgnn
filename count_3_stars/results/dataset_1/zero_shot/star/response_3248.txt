Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 9, 5)>
<1, (0, 2, 6)>
<2, (1, 3, 4)>
<4, (2, 3, 5)>
