Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
The 3-stars in this graph are:
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<0, (7, 8, 9)>
<1, (3, 4, 7)>
<2, (0, 3, 6)>
<2, (8, 9, 6)>
<3, (1, 2, 4)>
<6, (2, 7, 8)>
<6, (8, 9, 7)>
<7, (0, 3, 4)>
<8, (0, 4, 5)>
<9, (0, 2, 6)>

There are a total of 11 unique 3-stars in this graph. Therefore, the final answer is [11].
