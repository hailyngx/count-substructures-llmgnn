Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 3-stars in the given graph. 

Here are the unique 3-stars found: 
<0, (5, 3, 8)>
<1, (3, 6, 8)>
<2, (4, 5, 7)>
<5, (0, 3, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [4].
