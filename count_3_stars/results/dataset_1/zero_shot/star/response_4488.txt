Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 6, 8)>
<1, (2, 6, 9)>
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<3, (2, 7, 4)>
<4, (7, 8, 9)>
<5, (7, 8, 9)>
<6, (0, 1, 9)>
<7, (3, 4, 5)>
<8, (0, 4, 5)>
<9, (4, 6, 7)>
