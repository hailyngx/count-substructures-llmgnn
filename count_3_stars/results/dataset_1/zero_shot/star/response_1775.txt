Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 3) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (0, 4, 5)>
<4, (1, 2, 9)>
<5, (1, 2, 9)>
<6, (1, 2, 9)>
