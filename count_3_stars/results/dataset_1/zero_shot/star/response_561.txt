Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 2 3-stars in the given graph, which can be represented as <2, (4, 6, 8)> and <4, (2, 5, 9)>.
Therefore, the final answer is [2].
