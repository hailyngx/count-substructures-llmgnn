Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 8, 4)>
<6, (2, 9, 8)>
