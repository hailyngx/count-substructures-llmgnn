Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
The 3-stars are: 
<0, (2, 6, 9)>
<1, (2, 6, 9)>
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<3, (2, 4, 9)>
<4, (1, 3, 6)>
<6, (0, 1, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [6].
