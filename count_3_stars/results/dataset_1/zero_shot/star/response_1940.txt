Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph, which are as follows:

<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<2, (3, 4, 5)>
<2, (4, 6, 7)>
<4, (2, 3, 8)>
<4, (2, 5, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
