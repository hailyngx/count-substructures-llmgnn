Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 8) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are two 3-stars in the given graph. Here is the calculation:

1. The first 3-star: <0, (2, 6, 7)>
2. The second 3-star: <1, (5, 8, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
