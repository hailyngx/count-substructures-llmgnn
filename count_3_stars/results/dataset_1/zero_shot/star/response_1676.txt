Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-star subgraphs in the given graph. All these 3-stars have a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Below are the unique 3-stars found:

<0, (1, 2, 9)>
<1, (0, 5, 6)>
<3, (4, 5, 6)>
<4, (3, 7, 8)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
