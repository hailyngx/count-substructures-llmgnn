Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are a total of 4 different 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are:

<0, (4, 1, 2)>
<1, (3, 4, 7)>
<2, (4, 9, 6)>
<3, (1, 7, 5)>

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
