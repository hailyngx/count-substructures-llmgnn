Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (4, 6, 7)>
<1, (4, 7, 8)>
<2, (3, 6, 8)>
<6, (0, 4, 8)>
