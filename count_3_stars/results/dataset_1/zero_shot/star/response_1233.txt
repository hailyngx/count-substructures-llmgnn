Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:
- <0, (5, 6, 8)>
- <1, (3, 7, -)>
- <2, (6, 8, 9)>
- <3, (1, 6, 8)>
- <4, (6, -, -)>
- <5, (0, 8, 9)>
- <6, (0, 2, 3)>
- <7, (1, -, -)>
- <8, (0, 2, 3)>
- <9, (2, 3, 5)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we find that there are [9] 3-star patterns in the given graph.
