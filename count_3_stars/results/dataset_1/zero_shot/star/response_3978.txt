Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.  
The unique 3-stars are:  
<0, (5, 9, 6)>  
<1, (2, 6, 7)>  
<3, (6, 9, 4)>  
<9, (6, 5, 4)>
