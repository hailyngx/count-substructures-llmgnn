Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are two 3-stars in the given graph. 

The first 3-star is <0, (1, 5, 6)>.

The second 3-star is <7, (1, 2, 3)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
