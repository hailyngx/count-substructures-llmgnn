Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 6, 8)>
<2, (3, 4, 5)>
<4, (2, 5, 6)>
<5, (2, 4, 6)>
<6, (0, 4, 5)>
<8, (0, 4, 9)>
