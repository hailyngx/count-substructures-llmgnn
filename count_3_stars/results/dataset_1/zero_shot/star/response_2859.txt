Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The graph consists of the following 3-star configurations:
\[ <0, (2, 6, 1)>, <1, (8, 3, 2)>, <2, (0, 9, 1)>, <3, (1, 9, 4)>, <4, (8, 6, 3)>, <5, (6, 9, 0)>, <6, (4, 8, 0)>, <8, (4, 1, 6)>, <9, (2, 3, 5)> \]
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
