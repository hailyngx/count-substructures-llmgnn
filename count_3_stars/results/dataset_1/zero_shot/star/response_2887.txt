Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star structures in the given graph. A 3-star consists of a center node connected to three other nodes. Let's list down all the 3-star structures below:

<1, (0, 7, 8)>  
<4, (2, 3, 9)>  
<9, (3, 4, 6)>  

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph.  
There are 3 unique 3-star structures, so the total number of 3-stars is [3].
