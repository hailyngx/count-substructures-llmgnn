Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be found by looking at each node in the graph and checking how many 3-stars are connected to it. Let's go ahead and determine the number of 3-stars in this graph.

Given the edge information, we can now determine the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 0: <0, (1, 4, 8)>
- Node 1: <1, (0, 7, 9)>
- Node 2: <2, (7, 8, 9)>
- Node 3: No 3-star connected to node 3.
- Node 4: <4, (0, 7, 8)>
- Node 5: No 3-star connected to node 5.
- Node 6: No 3-star connected to node 6.
- Node 7: <7, (1, 2, 4)>
- Node 8: <8, (0, 2, 4)>
- Node 9: <9, (1, 2, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6]. The unique 3-stars are <0, (1, 4, 8)>, <1, (0, 7, 9)>, <2, (7, 8, 9)>, <4, (0, 7, 8)>, <7, (1, 2, 4)>, and <8, (0, 2, 4)>.
