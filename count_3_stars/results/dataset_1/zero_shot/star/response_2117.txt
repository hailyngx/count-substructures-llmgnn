Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are **7** 3-stars in the given graph. The unique 3-stars are:  
<0, (2, 3, 4)>  
<0, (4, 5, 6)>  
<1, (2, 4, 7)>  
<1, (4, 7, 8)>  
<3, (0, 4, 7)>  
<4, (0, 1, 2)>  
<6, (0, 1, 3)>  

Therefore, the final answer is **[7]**.
