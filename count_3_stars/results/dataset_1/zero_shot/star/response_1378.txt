Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 4, 7)>
<1, (0, 2, 7)>
<2, (1, 3, 7)>
<3, (0, 2, 6)>
<4, (0, 5, 6)>
<5, (1, 4, 7)>
