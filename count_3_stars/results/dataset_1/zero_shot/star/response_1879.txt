Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The 3-stars are <0, (6, 7, 8)> and <2, (1, 8, 9)>. Thus, the final answer is [2].
