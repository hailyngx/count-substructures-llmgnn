Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The 3-star graphs present in the given graph are as follows: 

[<2, (4, 5, 6)>, <5, (2, 4, 7)>, <9, (0, 1, 8)>]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
