Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph, and the final answer is [5].
The 3-stars found are:
1. <0, (3, 6, 7)>
2. <0, (3, 7, 8)>
3. <2, (1, 5, 8)>
4. <4, (5, 7, 9)>
5. <5, (2, 3, 8)>
