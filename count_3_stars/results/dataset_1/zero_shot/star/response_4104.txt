Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
The nodes in the given graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:

1. <0, (1, 3, 5)>
2. <1, (0, 2, 3)>
3. <2, (1, 7, 9)>
4. <3, (0, 1, 6)>
5. <5, (0, 1, _)>  (One leaf node missing)
6. <6, (0, 3, 8)>
7. <7, (0, 2, 8)>
8. <8, (6, 7, _)> (One leaf node missing)
9. <9, (2, _, _)>  (Two leaf nodes missing)

Therefore, there are [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
