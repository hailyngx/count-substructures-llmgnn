Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph:
<0, (5, 8, 9)>
<1, (3, 4, 9)>
<2, (3, 5, 7)>
<3, (1, 2, 7)>
<4, (1, 5, 7)>
<5, (0, 2, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
