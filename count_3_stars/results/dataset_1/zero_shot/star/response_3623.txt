Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The graph contains the following 3-stars:

[<0, (1, 2, 8)>, <2, (0, 3, 4)>, <4, (2, 6, 8)>, <6, (1, 3, 4)>, <8, (0, 2, 4)>, <9, (3, 4, 0)>]

Therefore, there are a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
