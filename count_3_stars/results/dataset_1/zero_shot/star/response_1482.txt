Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in this graph.

<0, (3, 6, 9)>
<1, (4, 6, 7)>
<1, (6, 4, 7)>
<2, (4, 9, 2)>
<4, (1, 2, 5)>
<6, (1, 0, 8)>
