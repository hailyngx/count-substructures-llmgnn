Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<1, (2, 4, 7)>
