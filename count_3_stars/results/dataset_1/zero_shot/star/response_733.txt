Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. They are:

<0, (5, 8, 1)>
<5, (0, 8, 6)>
<1, (5, 8, 6)>
<4, (2, 9, 8)>
<6, (1, 8, 5)>
<8, (5, 6, 1)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
