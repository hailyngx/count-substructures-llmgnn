Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph contains the following 3-stars:

[<0, (2, 3, 4)>, <2, (0, 6, 7)>, <4, (0, 6, 8)>, <6, (0, 1, 2)>, <8, (2, 4, 6)>]

There are 5 unique 3-stars in total, so the final answer is [5].
