Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The 3-star graphs found in the given graph are:

<0, (3, 6, 7)>
<1, (3, 5, 7)>
<2, (3, 6, 8)>
<6, (0, 2, 8)>
<7, (0, 1, 9)>
<8, (3, 6, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
