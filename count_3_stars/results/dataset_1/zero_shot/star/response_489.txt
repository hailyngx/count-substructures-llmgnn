Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph contains the following 3-stars:
    
    [5]
    <0, (2, 6, 1)>
    <1, (2, 5, 6)>
    <2, (0, 1, 3)>
    <3, (2, 4, 7)>
    <4, (1, 3, 5)>
    <5, (1, 4, 9)>
    <6, (0, 1, 4)>
    <7, (1, 3, 8)>
    <8>
    <9, (1, 5, 8)> 
    
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
