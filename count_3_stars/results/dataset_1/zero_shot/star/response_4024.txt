Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are as follows:
<0, (5, 6, 8)>
<2, (6, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 1, 2)>
<9, (0, 2, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
