Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:
- <0, (1, 2, 5)>
- <1, (0, 5, 9)>
- <2, (0, 4, 8)>
- <3, (4, 8, 9)>
- <4, (2, 3, 8)>
- <5, (0, 1, 7)>
- <8, (2, 3, 6)>
- <9, (1, 3, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
