Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 3-stars with the following nodes:
<0, (3, 4, 6)>
<1, (5, 8, 9)>
<4, (0, 3, 7)>
<5, (1, 7, 8)>
<7, (4, 5, 8)>
<9, (1, 2, 8)>
