Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The 3-stars are:
    
    <0, (7, 3, 9)>
    <2, (8, 7, 3)>
    <4, (6, 7, 5)>
    <8, (2, 7, 9)>
    
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
