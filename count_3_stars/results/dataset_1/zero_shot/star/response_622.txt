Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph can be counted by identifying nodes that are connected to exactly 3 other nodes, which forms a 3-star.

To start, let's list out the 3-stars present in the graph:

<0, (2, 3, 7)>
<1, (8, 9, 1)>
<2, (0, 3, 5)>
<3, (0, 2, 7)>
<4, (6, 9, 4)>
<5, (8, 2, 5)>
<6, (7, 2, 4)>
<7, (2, 3, 6)>
<8, (1, 5, 8)>
<9, (1, 4, 7)>

Therefore, there are a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
