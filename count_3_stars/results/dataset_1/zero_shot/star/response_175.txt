Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (3, 9, 5)>
<1, (2, 5, 8)>
<3, (0, 4, 5)>
<4, (3, 5, 7)>
<9, (0, 5, 8)>
