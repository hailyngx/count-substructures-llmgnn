Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are a total of [3] 3-stars in the given graph, and they are:

<0, (2, 5, 7)>
<5, (0, 3, 6)>
<9, (0, 3, 7)>
