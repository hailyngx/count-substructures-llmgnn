Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph can be found by identifying all the nodes that are central nodes of 3-stars. Since each 3-star has 3 leaves, we can identify the central nodes by checking which nodes have exactly 3 neighbors.

The unique 3-stars found in the given graph are:
<0, (1, 5, 8)>, <1, (0, 4, 5)>, <2, (1, 3, 6)>, <4, (1, 6, 5)>, <5, (0, 1, 7)>, <6, (2, 4, 5)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
