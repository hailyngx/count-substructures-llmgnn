Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (4, 2) (6, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 8, 2)>
<1, (0, 8, 2)>
<2, (0, 1, 4)>
<8, (0, 1, 9)>

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
