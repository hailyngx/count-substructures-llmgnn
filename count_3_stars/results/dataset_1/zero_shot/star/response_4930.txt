Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 3 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The 3-stars are as follows:

<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<5, (0, 4, 7)>
<7, (1, 4, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
