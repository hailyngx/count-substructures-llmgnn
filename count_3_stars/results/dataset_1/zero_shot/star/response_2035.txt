Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
The 3-stars are: 
<0, (1, 2, 9)>
<7, (4, 5, 6)>
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
