Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of 3-star graphs can be determined by looking at the number of nodes each node is connected to. Since a 3-star graph consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we need to look for nodes in the graph that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

By examining the given graph, we find the following 3-stars:
<1, (3, 5, 6)>
<2, (3, 5, 6)>
<5, (1, 2, 9)>
<6, (1, 2, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [4].
