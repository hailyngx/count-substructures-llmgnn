Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph consists of the following 3-stars:
<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<0, (1, 6, 9)>
<1, (0, 4, 5)>
<1, (5, 6, 9)>
<2, (3, 6, 9)>
<3, (2, 6, 9)>
<4, (0, 1, 7)>
<5, (1, 6, 7)>
<6, (0, 2, 7)>
<7, (4, 5, 6)>
<9, (0, 5, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [11].
