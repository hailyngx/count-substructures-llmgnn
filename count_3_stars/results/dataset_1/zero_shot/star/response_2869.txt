Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 3 unique 3-stars in the given graph.  
The 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 8, 1)>
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<2, (1, 3, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
