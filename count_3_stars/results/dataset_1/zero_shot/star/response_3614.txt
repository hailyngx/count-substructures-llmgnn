Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:

[<0, (2, 5, 6)>, <2, (0, 1, 4)>, <3, (0, 6, 9)>, <5, (0, 1, 8)>, <6, (0, 3, 8)>, <8, (3, 5, 6)>]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
