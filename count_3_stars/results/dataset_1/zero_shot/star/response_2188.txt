Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:
    - <0, (4, 5, 6)>
    - <0, (4, 5, 7)>
    - <0, (4, 6, 7)>
    - <0, (5, 6, 7)>
    - <1, (5, 9, 2)> 
    - <4, (0, 5, 9)>
    - <6, (0, 2, 8)>
    - <9, (1, 2, 8)>
  
  Therefore, there are [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
