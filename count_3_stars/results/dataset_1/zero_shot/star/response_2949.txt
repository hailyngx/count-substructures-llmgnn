Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be calculated by examining each node to see how many 3-stars are centered at that node. Let's break it down:

- Node 0: <0, (3, 4, 7)> and <0, (4, 7, 8)> (2 3-stars)
- Node 1: No 3-stars as it's connected to only 2 nodes.
- Node 2: No 3-stars as it's connected to only 1 node.
- Node 3: <3, (0, 7, 4)> (1 3-star)
- Node 4: <4, (0, 7, 6)> and <4, (6, 7, 8)> (2 3-stars)
- Node 5: No 3-stars as it's connected to only 2 nodes.
- Node 6: <6, (1, 4, 5)> and <6, (8, 4, 7)> (2 3-stars)
- Node 7: <7, (0, 4, 8)> and <7, (0, 3, 4)> (2 3-stars)
- Node 8: <8, (0, 4, 7)> and <8, (4, 6, 7)> (2 3-stars)
- Node 9: No 3-stars as it's connected to only 2 nodes.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [11]. 
The unique 3-stars found are <0, (3, 4, 7)>, <0, (4, 7, 8)>, <3, (0, 7, 4)>, <4, (0, 7, 6)>, <4, (6, 7, 8)>, <6, (1, 4, 5)>, <6, (8, 4, 7)>, <7, (0, 4, 8)>, <7, (0, 3, 4)>, <8, (0, 4, 7)>, and <8, (4, 6, 7)>.
