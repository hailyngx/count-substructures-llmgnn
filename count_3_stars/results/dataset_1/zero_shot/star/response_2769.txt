Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:

[<0, (2, 4, 7)>, <1, (2, 5, 6)>, <2, (0, 1, 3)>, <4, (0, 7, 8)>, <6, (1, 8, 9)>] 

Total number of 3-stars in the graph: [5]
