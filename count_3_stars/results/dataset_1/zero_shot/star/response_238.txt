Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are a total of 4 3-star structures in the given graph. They are:

<1, (0, 5, 6)>
<3, (2, 4, 7)>
<3, (5, 7, 8)>
<9, (1, 3, 4)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
