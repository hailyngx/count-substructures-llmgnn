Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) 

Response:
There are a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<0, (4, 7, 8)>
<4, (0, 1, 7)>
<4, (3, 6, 7)>
<6, (4, 7, 0)>
<7, (0, 4, 6)>
