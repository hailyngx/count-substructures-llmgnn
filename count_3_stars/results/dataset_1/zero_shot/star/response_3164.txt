Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
    
    The unique 3-stars found are:
    <0, (3, 5, 6)>
    <0, (5, 1, 7)>
    <0, (6, 8, 7)>
    <1, (2, 9, 5)>
    <2, (1, 4, 7)>
    <2, (4, 8, 9)>
    <5, (0, 1, 3)>
    <5, (3, 9, 1)>
