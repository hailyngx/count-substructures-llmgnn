Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 4) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 9) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [3] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (6, 7, 8)>
<0, (6, 7, 9)>
<0, (6, 8, 9)>
