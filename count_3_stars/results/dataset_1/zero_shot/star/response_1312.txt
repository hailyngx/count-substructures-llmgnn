Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The count is denoted inside brackets []

<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<2, (1, 6, 9)>
<4, (0, 7, 9)>
<5, (1, 8, 9)>
<9, (0, 6, 7)>
