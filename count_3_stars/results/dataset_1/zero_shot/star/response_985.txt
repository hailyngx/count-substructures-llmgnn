Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:
[<0, (4, 8, 9)>, <1, (5, 9, 1)>, <4, (0, 6, 9)>, <8, (0, 6, 9)>]
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
