Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph. 
The unique 3-stars are: <0, (3, 4, 5)>, <2, (7, 9, 4)>, <4, (0, 7, 9)>, <7, (2, 3, 4)>, <9, (2, 4, 7)>, <3, (7, 0, 4)>.
