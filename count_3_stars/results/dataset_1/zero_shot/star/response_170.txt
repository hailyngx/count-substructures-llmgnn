Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 6) (2, 6) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The list of 3-stars is as follows:

<0, (6, 1, 2)>
<4, (3, 7, 9)>
<5, (6, 8, 9)>
<6, (0, 1, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
