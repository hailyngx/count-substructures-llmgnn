Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in this graph. The count of 3-stars is [4].

<0, (2, 3, 7)>
<1, (3, 7, 9)>
<2, (0, 4, 6)>
<3, (0, 1, 5)>
