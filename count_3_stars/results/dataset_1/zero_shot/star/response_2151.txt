Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (4, 6, 9)>
<8, (2, 4, 9)>
