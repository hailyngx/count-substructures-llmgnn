Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:
1. <0, (1, 4, 6)>
2. <2, (7, 8, 2)>
3. <3, (9, 5, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
