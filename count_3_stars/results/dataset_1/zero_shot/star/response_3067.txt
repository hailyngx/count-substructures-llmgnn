Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be calculated by counting the possible combinations of selecting 3 leaves from the 10 nodes. Since each 3-star has 1 center node and 3 leaves, there are 10 * C(9, 3) = 10 * 84 = 840 3-stars in total.

The unique 3-stars in the given graph are:
<0, (4, 7, 9)>
<1, (3, 5, 9)>
<1, (5, 2, 7)>
<4, (0, 6, 8)>
<7, (0, 5, 9)>

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
