Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (8, 4) 

Response:
There are 4 three-stars in the given graph. The unique 3-stars are:

<0, (1, 4, 8)>
<2, (5, 3, 7)>
<3, (4, 5, 6)>
<4, (0, 3, 6)>

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
