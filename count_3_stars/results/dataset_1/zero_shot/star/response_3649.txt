Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 9) (8, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (3, 4, 8)>
<1, (2, 4, 8)>
<3, (0, 4, 5)>
<4, (1, 3, 8)>
