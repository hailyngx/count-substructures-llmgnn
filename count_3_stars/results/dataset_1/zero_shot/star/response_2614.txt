Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (7, 4) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are:

<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<3, (1, 5, 9)>
<4, (0, 5, 7)>
<5, (3, 4, 0)>

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
