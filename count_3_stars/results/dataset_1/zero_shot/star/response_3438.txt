Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 3-star structures in the given graph. Here is the breakdown:

- There are <0, (1, 7, 9)> 3-stars.
- There are <1, (0, 3, 4)> 3-stars.
- There are <3, (1, 2, 6)> 3-stars.
- There are <4, (1, 6, 7)> 3-stars.
- There are <6, (3, 4, 5)> 3-stars.
- There are <9, (0, 3, 8)> 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
