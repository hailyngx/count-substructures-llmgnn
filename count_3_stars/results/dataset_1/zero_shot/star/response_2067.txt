Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
The 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 7, 8)>
<1, (0, 4, 5)>
<2, (3, 6, X)>
<3, (2, 4, X)>
<4, (1, 3, 5)>
<5, (1, 4, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
