Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-star subgraphs in the given graph.  

The 3-star subgraphs are:
<1, (3, 4, 6)>
<2, (3, 5, 6)>
<5, (2, 4, 8)>
<6, (1, 2, 3)>
