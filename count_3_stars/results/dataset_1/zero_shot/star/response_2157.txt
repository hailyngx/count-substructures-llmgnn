Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.
  
The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (4, 5, 9)>
<3, (2, 4, 6)>
<4, (1, 5, 6)>
<5, (1, 4, 9)>
