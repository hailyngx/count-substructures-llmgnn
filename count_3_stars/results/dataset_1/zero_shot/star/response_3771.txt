Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [8] 3-stars in the given graph. 
The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (5, 6, 7)>
<1, (2, 5, 9)>
<2, (1, 3, 5)>
<3, (2, 4, 9)>
<4, (5, 8, 9)>
<5, (0, 1, 4)>
<6, (0, 7, 9)>
<9, (1, 4, 7)>
