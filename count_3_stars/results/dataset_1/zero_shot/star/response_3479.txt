Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
    
    The unique 3-stars are:
    <0, (2, 4, 7)>
    <0, (4, 7, 8)>
    <0, (7, 8, 5)>
    <1, (4, 6, 3)>
    <3, (4, 5, 9)>
    <6, (2, 3, 9)>
    <6, (8, 9, 3)>
