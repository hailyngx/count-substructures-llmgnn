Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are a total of two 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are:

<[3, (2, 4, 7)]>
<[5, (0, 1, 9)]>

Therefore, the final answer is [2].
