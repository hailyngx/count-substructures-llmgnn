Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are:
[<0, (4, 5, 6)>, <2, (3, 5, 6)>, <4, (0, 3, 7)>, <5, (0, 2, 7)>, <6, (0, 2, 7)>, <7, (4, 5, 6)>, <8, (2, 5, 9)>, <9, (4, 8)>]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
