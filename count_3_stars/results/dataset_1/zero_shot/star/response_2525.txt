Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are two 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are:

1. <0, (1, 5, 6)>
2. <1, (0, 5, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
