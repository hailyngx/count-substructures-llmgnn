Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:
\[<0, (1, 3, 9)>, <1, (0, 4, 8)>, <3, (0, 2, 9)>, <4, (1, 2, 9)>, <8, (1, 5, 9)> \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
