Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].

The unique 3-stars present in the graph are:
<1, (4, 6, 9)>
<3, (2, 8, 9)>
<8, (3, 6, 9)>
