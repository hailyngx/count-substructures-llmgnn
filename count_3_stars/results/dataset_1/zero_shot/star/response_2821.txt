Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are two 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (6, 7, 4)>
<9, (0, 3, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
