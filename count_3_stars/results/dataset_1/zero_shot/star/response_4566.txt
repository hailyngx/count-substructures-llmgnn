Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The final answer is [2].

The 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 6, 8)>
<1, (0, 2, 5)>
