Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:
[<0, (1, 2, 7)>, <1, (0, 5, 3)>, <2, (0, 4, 6)>, <3, (1, 5, 8)>, <4, (2, 7, -)>, <5, (1, 3, -)>, <6, (2, -, -)>, <7, (0, 2, 4)>, <8, (3, 7, -)>]

Therefore, there are a total of [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
