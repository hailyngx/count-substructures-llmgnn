Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are:

<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<2, (4, 5, 7)>
<3, (7, 8, 9)>
<6, (0, 5, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
