Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are a total of 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are listed inside <>:

<0, (7, 8, 4)>
<1, (2, 7, 9)>
<3, (5, 6, 7)>
<4, (7, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
