Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<1, (4, 5, 7)>
<5, (1, 4, 6)>
<6, (3, 5, 7)>
<9, (4, 5, 8)>
