Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 2) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be calculated by finding how many nodes can act as the center of a 3-star. 

Let's count the 3-stars by checking each node to see how many valid 3-star configurations it can form as the center:
- Node 0: <0, (2, 4, 7)>, <0, (2, 7, 8)>, <0, (4, 7, 8)> (3 3-stars)
- Node 1: <1, (2, 6, 7)>, <1, (2, 7, 8)>, <1, (6, 7, 8)> (3 3-stars)
- Node 2: <2, (0, 1, 5)>, <2, (0, 5, 9)>, <2, (1, 5, 9)> (3 3-stars)
- Node 4: <4, (0, 6, 8)>, <4, (6, 1, 8)> (2 3-stars)
- Node 6: <6, (4, 1, 7)> (1 3-star)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12]. The unique 3-stars found are <0, (2, 4, 7)>, <0, (2, 7, 8)>, <0, (4, 7, 8)>, <1, (2, 6, 7)>, <1, (2, 7, 8)>, <1, (6, 7, 8)>, <2, (0, 1, 5)>, <2, (0, 5, 9)>, <2, (1, 5, 9)>, <4, (0, 6, 8)>, <4, (6, 1, 8)>, <6, (4, 1, 7)>.
