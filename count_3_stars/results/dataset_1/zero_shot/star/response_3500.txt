Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:
[<2, (0, 4, 5)>, <3, (2, 4, 6)>, <4, (2, 3, 9)>, <5, (2, 4, 7)>, <6, (1, 3, -)>, <7, (2, 5, 9)>, <9, (1, 4, 7)>]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
