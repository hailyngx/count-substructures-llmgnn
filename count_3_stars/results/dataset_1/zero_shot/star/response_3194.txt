Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be counted as follows:

- Node 0: (0, 1, 5), (0, 1, 6)
- Node 1: (1, 0, 4)
- Node 2: (2, 3, 7), (2, 3, 9)
- Node 3: (3, 2, 5), (3, 2, 7), (3, 2, 9)
- Node 4: (4, 1, 2), (4, 1, 6), (4, 1, 7)
- Node 5: (5, 0, 3), (5, 0, 7), (5, 0, 8)
- Node 6: (6, 0, 2), (6, 0, 4), (6, 0, 8)
- Node 7: (7, 2, 3), (7, 2, 4), (7, 2, 5)
- Node 8: (8, 3, 5), (8, 3, 6)
- Node 9: (9, 2, 3)

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [16].  
The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 5, 6)>, <1, (0, 4, 6)>, <2, (3, 7, 9)>, <3, (2, 5, 7)>, <4, (1, 2, 6)>, <5, (0, 3, 7)>, <6, (0, 2, 4)>, <7, (2, 3, 4)>, <8, (3, 5, 6)>, <9, (2, 3, 9)>.
