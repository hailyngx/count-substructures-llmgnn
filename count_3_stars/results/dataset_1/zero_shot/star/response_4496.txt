Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 8 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are <0, (3, 5, 6)>, <1, (3, 6, 7)>, <2, (4, 6, 9)>, <3, (0, 1, 5)>, <4, (2, 6, 7)>, <5, (0, 3, 6)>, <6, (1, 3, 4)>, <7, (1, 4, 6)>.

Therefore, the final answer is [8].
