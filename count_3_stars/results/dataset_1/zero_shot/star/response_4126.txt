Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars present in this graph:

<0, (1, 5, 1)>
<1, (0, 4, 9)>
<2, (5, 6, 8)>
<5, (0, 2, 3)>
<6, (2, 7, 8)>
<4, (1, 7, 9)>
<9, (1, 4, 7)>
<8, (2, 6, 9)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the given graph: [8].
