Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The central nodes for each 3-star are nodes 0, 1, 5, 8, and 9. Here are the unique 3-stars in the given graph:
<0, (1, 3, 7)>
<1, (0, 7, 9)>
<5, (2, 3, 4)>
<8, (5, 7, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 6)>
