Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in this graph is [8].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (3, 6, 7)>
<2, (1, 6, 9)>
<3, (0, 4, 5)>
<4, (1, 3, 6)>
<5, (3, 6, 7)>
<6, (0, 2, 4)>
<7, (0, 5, 6)>
<8, (4, 5, 6)>
