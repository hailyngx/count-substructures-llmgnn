Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be found based on the fact that a 3-star involves a center node connected to exactly three other nodes.
To count the number of 3-stars, we need to find nodes that form 3-stars in the graph. Let's identify the 3-stars first:

<0, (5, 7, 9)>
<1, (3, 8, -)>
<2, (6, 7, 9)>
<3, (1, -, -)>
<4, (6, 8, 9)>
<5, (0, 6, -)>
<6, (2, 4, 5)>
<7, (0, 2, 9)>
<8, (1, 4, -)>
<9, (0, 2, 4)>

From the identified 3-stars, we can see that there are 9 unique 3-stars present in the graph.
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
