Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here are the 3-stars in the graph:

[<0, (6, 7, 4)>, <2, (3, 9, 4)>, <4, (3, 6, 6)>, <6, (0, 7, 5)>]
