Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The 3-stars are as follows:
    
    <0, (2, 3, 5)>
    <1, (3, 6, 7)>
    <2, (0, 3, 5)>
    <3, (0, 1, 2)>
    <4, (3, 7, 8)>
    <5, (0, 2, 6)>
    
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
