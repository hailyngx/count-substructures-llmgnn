Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 6) (3, 5) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [5] 3-stars in the given graph. The unique 3-stars are:

<0, (8, 9, 6)>
<1, (6, 7, 4)>
<4, (5, 6, 7)>
<5, (3, 4, 6)>
<6, (1, 2, 4)>
