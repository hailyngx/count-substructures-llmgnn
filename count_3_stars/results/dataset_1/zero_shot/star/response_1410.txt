Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 3 unique 3-stars in this graph. The 3-stars are <0, (6, 7, 8)>, <3, (1, 4, 9)>, and <4, (2, 3, 8)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
