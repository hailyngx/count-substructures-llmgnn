Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
The graph has the following 3-stars:
[<0, (1, 2, 4)>, <1, (0, 3, 7)>, <2, (0, 4, -)>, <3, (1, 9, -)>, <4, (0, 2, -)>, <6, (0, 7, -)>, <7, (1, 6, -)>, <9, (0, 1, 3)>]

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
