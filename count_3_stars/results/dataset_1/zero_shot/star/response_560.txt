Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 8) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [3] 3-stars in the given graph.
   
   <0, (3, 9, 8)>
   <6, (2, 4, 5)>
   <8, (1, 3, 9)>
