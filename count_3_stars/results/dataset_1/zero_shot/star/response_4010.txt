Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<3, (4, 5, 9)>
<5, (3, 8, 9)>
<6, (3, 7, 9)>
