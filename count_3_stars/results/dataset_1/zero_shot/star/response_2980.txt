Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph can be calculated by first identifying the central node and then finding all possible combinations of three leaf nodes connected to the central node. 

First, let's identify the central nodes in the graph:
- Node 0 has the following connected nodes: 3, 5, 6, 8
- Node 1 has the following connected nodes: 3, 7
- Node 2 has the following connected nodes: 3, 4, 5, 7
- Node 3 has the following connected nodes: 0, 1, 2, 7
- Node 4 has the following connected nodes: 2, 5, 6
- Node 5 has the following connected nodes: 0, 2, 4, 9
- Node 6 has the following connected nodes: 0, 4
- Node 7 has the following connected nodes: 1, 2, 3, 9
- Node 8 has the following connected nodes: 0
- Node 9 has the following connected nodes: 5, 7

Next, we find all the 3-star configurations:
- <0, (3, 5, 6)>
- <0, (3, 5, 8)>
- <2, (3, 4, 5)>
- <3, (0, 1, 2)>
- <4, (2, 5, 6)>
- <5, (0, 2, 4)>
- <7, (1, 2, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
