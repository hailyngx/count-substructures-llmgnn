Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 4 and 5.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 6.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 7, 8, and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 6, and 7.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, and 8.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 4.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 7, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 8.

Let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars in this graph are:
<0, (4, 5, 0)>
<1, (3, 5, 1)>
<1, (6, 3, 1)>
<2, (4, 3, 2)>
<2, (7, 9, 2)>
<3, (5, 1, 3)>
<4, (2, 6, 4)>
<4, (7, 3, 4)>
<8, (7, 9, 8)>
<8, (5, 2, 8)>

Hence, there are [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
