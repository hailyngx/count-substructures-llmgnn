Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are no 3-stars in the given graph. The graph does not contain any instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Hence, the count of 3-stars is [0].
