Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 0) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 3 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are: <0, (1, 2, 4)>, <0, (7, 8, 9)>, and <1, (0, 6, 7)>. Therefore, the final answer is [3].
