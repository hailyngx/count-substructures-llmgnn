Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
The given graph has a total of 10 nodes and 24 edges. To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star. 

Let's list the 3-stars present in the graph:

<0, (1, 3, 7)>
<1, (0, 2, 7)>
<2, (1, 7, 8)>
<3, (0, 7, 4)>
<4, (7, 8, 5)>
<5, (8, 9)>
<6, (8)>
<7, (0, 2, 3, 4)>
<8, (2, 4, 5, 6)>
<9, (5)>

There are a total of [9] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
