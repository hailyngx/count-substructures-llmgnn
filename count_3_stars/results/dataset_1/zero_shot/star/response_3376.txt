Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be calculated by looking at each node and determining how many 3-stars it participates in. Since a 3-star consists of a central node connected to three other nodes, we can identify a 3-star by looking at each node's neighbors. 

For this graph, the 3-stars can be identified as follows:
<0, (2, 8, 9)>
<1, (2, 5, 6)>
<2, (0, 1, 7)>
<5, (1, 4, 6)>
<3, (2, 8, -)>
<4, (5, -, -)>
<6, (1, 8, -)>
<7, (2, 8, -)>
<8, (0, 3, 6)>
<9, (0, -, -)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we find that there are [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
