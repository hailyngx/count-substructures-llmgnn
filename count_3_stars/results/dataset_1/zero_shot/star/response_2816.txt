Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 2, 8)>
<0, (2, 1, 8)>
<0, (5, 8, 2)>
<0, (8, 2, 1)>
<1, (0, 2, 8)>
<2, (0, 1, 8)>
<2, (4, 8, 0)>
<5, (0, 8, 2)>
