Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 3-star structures in this graph. The count of 3-stars is [5]. The unique 3-stars found are:
    <0, (6, 8, 1)>
    <2, (5, 7, 8)>
    <4, (1, 6, 5)>
    <5, (2, 7, 9)>
    <6, (0, 1, 4)>
