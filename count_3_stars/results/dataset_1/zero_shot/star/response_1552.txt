Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) 

Response:
There are [10] unique 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (1, 7, 8)>
<1, (0, 6, 7)>
<2, (4, 6, 8)>
<3, (4, 6, 8)>
<4, (0, 2, 3)>
<5, (0, 6, 8)>
<6, (1, 2, 3)>
<7, (0, 1, 4)>
<8, (0, 2, 3)>
<8, (0, 3, 2)>
