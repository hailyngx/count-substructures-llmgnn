Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<2, (3, 5, 7)>
<3, (2, 5, 9)>
<5, (2, 6, 7)>
<7, (3, 5, 9)>
