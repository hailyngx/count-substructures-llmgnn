Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) 

Response:
There are \[6\] 3-stars in this graph.  
The unique 3-stars are:  
<0, (5, 7, 1)>  
<2, (4, 5, 9)>  
<2, (5, 8, 4)>  
<4, (2, 5, 7)>  
<4, (5, 8, 6)>  
<8, (2, 3, 6)>
