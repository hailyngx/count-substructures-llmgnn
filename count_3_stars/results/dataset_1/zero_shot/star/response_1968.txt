Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (3, 8, 1)>
<3, (0, 1, 4)>
<1, (2, 7, 9)>
<2, (1, 6, 7)>
