Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are a total of [4] 3-stars in the given graph. 

<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<4, (1, 9, 0)>
<9, (4, 5, 7)>
