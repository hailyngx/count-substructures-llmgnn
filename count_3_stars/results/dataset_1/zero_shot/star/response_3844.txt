Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph. The unique 3-stars are:

<0, (2, 8, 9)>
<2, (0, 1, 4)>
<3, (0, 5, 7)>
<4, (2, 6, 7)>
<5, (3, 9, 7)>
<7, (3, 4, 8)>
