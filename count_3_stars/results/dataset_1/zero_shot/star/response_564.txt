Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 5, 9)>
<1, (4, 5, 7)>
<2, (0, 8, 9)>
<3, (4, 6, 8)>
<4, (1, 3, 5)>
<5, (0, 1, 4)>
