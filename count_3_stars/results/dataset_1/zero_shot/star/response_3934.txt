Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The 3-star graph is a structure where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. In this given graph, we can identify the following 3-stars:

[<0, (1, 7, )>]
[<1, (0, 3, 4)>]
[<3, (1, 7, )>]
[<4, (1, 6, )>]
[<6, (1, 4, 7)>]
[<7, (0, 3, 6)>]

Counting the number of 3-stars in the graph gives:[6]
