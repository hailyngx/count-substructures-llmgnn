Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 5 unique 3-stars in this graph, which are:
<0, (2, 8, 1)>
<2, (0, 4, 7)>
<3, (1, 6, 9)>
<6, (3, 9, 7)>
<9, (8, 3, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
