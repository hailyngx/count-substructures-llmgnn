Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are a total of [3] 3-stars in the given graph.  

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 4, 7)>
<4, (1, 0, 2)>
<5, (7, 2, 3)>
