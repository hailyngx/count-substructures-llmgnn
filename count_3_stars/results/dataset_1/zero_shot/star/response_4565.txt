Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has 10 nodes with 34 edges. To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

After analyzing the given edges, we find the following unique 3-stars:

<0, (1, 4, 8)>
<1, (0, 2, 9)>
<2, (1, 5, X)> - There is no node connected to node 2 other than nodes 1 and 5.
<3, (4, 5, 6)>
<4, (0, 3, 8)>
<5, (2, 3, X)> - There is no node connected to node 5 other than nodes 2 and 3.
<6, (3, 4, 7)>
<7, (3, 4, 6)>
<8, (0, 4, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 8)>

There are 9 unique 3-stars in total. Therefore, the final answer is [9].
