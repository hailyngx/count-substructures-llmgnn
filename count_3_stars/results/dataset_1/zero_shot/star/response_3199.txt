Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are a total of [ ] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 3, 8)>
<3, (0, 4, 6)>
<4, (3, 6, 9)>
<6, (3, 4, 7)>
<7, (6, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 7, 9)>
<9, (3, 4, 5)>
