Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 4, 9)>
<2, (5, 7, -)>
<3, (0, 4, 6)>
<4, (0, 5, 7)>
<7, (2, 5, 8)>
<8, (4, 7, -)>
