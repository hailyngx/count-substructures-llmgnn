Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 5 unique 3-stars in this graph. The 3-stars are:

<0, (1, 2, 7)>
<2, (0, 5, 8)>
<3, (5, 7, 9)>
<4, (8, 6, 9)>
<6, (8, 4, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
