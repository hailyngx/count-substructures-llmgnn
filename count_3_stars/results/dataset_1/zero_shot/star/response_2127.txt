Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are a total of [7] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<1, (0, 6, 7)>
<2, (7, 9, 3)>
<4, (0, 5, 5)>
<5, (0, 4, 4)>
<6, (1, 7, 8)>
<7, (1, 2, 9)>
