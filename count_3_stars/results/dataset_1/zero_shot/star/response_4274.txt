Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph contains the following 3-star structures:
[<0, (2, 3, 8)>, <1, (5, 8, 9)>, <3, (0, 4, 6)>, <5, (1, 8, 9)>, <7, (3, 8, 9)>, <9, (5, 7, 8)>]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
