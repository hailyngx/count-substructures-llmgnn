Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 7 unique 3-stars in the given graph.

The 3-stars are:
<0, (5, 8, -)>
<1, (6, 8, -)>
<2, (3, 4, 6)>
<3, (2, 4, -)>
<4, (2, 3, 6)>
<6, (1, 2, 4)>
<8, (0, 1, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
