Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph, which are:

<0, (2, 5, 8)>
<2, (0, 1, 4)>
<3, (7, 8, 9)>
<5, (0, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
