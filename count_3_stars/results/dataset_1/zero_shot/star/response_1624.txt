Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
Since a 3-star graph consists of a central node connected to three other nodes and there are 10 nodes in total, we can start by identifying the central node possibilities. Then we can check which triples of connected nodes form 3-stars around each central node.

The central node possibilities are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

Let's go through each central node to find the 3-stars:

For central node 0:
- <0, (2, 9, 1)>

For central node 1:
- <1, (2, 3, 6)>
- <1, (6, 4, 3)>
- <1, (3, 7, 2)>

For central node 2:
- <2, (0, 5, 1)>
- <2, (1, 5, 6)>
- <2, (5, 4, 6)>

For central node 3:
- <3, (1, 7, 6)>

For central node 4:
- <4, (5, 6, 8)>
- <4, (6, 7, 5)>
- <4, (7, 6, 8)>

For central node 5:
- <5, (2, 4, 6)>

For central node 6:
- <6, (1, 4, 7)>
- <6, (4, 7, 8)>
- <6, (7, 3, 1)>
- <6, (4, 5, 1)>
- <6, (5, 2, 4)>
- <6, (9, 0, 1)>

For central node 7:
- <7, (3, 6, 4)>
- <7, (4, 8, 6)>

For central node 8:
- <8, (4, 6, 7)>

For central node 9:
- <9, (0, 6, 1)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we get a total of [16].
