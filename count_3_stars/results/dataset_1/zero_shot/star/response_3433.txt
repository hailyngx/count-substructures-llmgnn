Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 4 3-stars in the given graph. Here are the unique 3-stars:
<[1, (0, 2, 6)]>
<[1, (3, 4, 7)]>
<[1, (5, 8, 9)]>
<[2, (0, 1, 6)]>
Therefore, the answer is [4].
