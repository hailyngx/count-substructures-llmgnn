Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (5, 4, 6)>
<2, (4, 8, 9)>
<3, (6, 4, 9)>
<4, (5, 6, 8)>
<5, (0, 4, 6)>
<6, (0, 3, 5)>
<7, (5, 6, 7)>
<8, (2, 4, 9)>
