Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph contains the following 3-stars:
    - <1, (3, 6, 7)>
    - <1, (3, 7, 8)>
    - <1, (3, 8, 9)>
    - <1, (6, 7, 8)>
    - <1, (7, 8, 9)>
    - <1, (7, 8, 9)>
    - <3, (1, 4, 5)>
    - <3, (1, 5, 8)>
    - <3, (1, 8, 9)>
    - <4, (2, 3, 9)>
    - <7, (1, 8, 9)>
  
  Therefore, there are a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
