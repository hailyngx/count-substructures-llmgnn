Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The list of unique 3-stars is as follows:
   
<1, (4, 6, 8)>
<1, (4, 6, 9)>
<2, (4, 6, 7)>
<3, (4, 1, 8)>
<5, (6, 1, 2)>
<7, (9, 1, 2)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
