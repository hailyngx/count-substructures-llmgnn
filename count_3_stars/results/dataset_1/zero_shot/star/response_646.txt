Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph.  

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 6, 9)>
<1, (3, 5, 9)>
<3, (1, 5, 9)>
<5, (1, 3, 9)>
<6, (0, 5, 9)>
<9, (0, 2, 3)>
