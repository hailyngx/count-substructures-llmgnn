Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 5) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph. The unique 3-stars are:

<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<2, (4, 5, 8)>
<5, (2, 3, 9)>
