Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The given graph contains the following 3-stars:
    
    - <0, (1, 4, 6)>
    - <0, (8, 0, 9)>
    - <1, (2, 0, 3)>
    - <4, (7, 0, 9)>
    - <5, (3, 9, 8)>  
    
    Therefore, there are a total of [5] 3-stars in the graph.
