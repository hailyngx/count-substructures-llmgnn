Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in this graph is [5].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 3, 8)>
<1, (4, 8, 0)>
<2, (0, 3, 5)>
<4, (1, 3, 8)>
<8, (1, 4, 7)>
