Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) 

Response:
The given graph contains a certain number of 3-stars. Let's identify them.

By definition, a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. We can visualize this as a central node being the common point of three paths or edges connecting to other nodes.

Based on the provided edges, we can find the following 3-stars:
1. <0, (1, 2, 3)>
2. <1, (0, 4, 7)>
3. <2, (0, 3, 8)>
4. <3, (0, 2, 7)>
5. <4, (1, 5, 6)>
6. <5, (4, 7)>  (Note: This is not a 3-star as it has only two edges)
7. <6, (4)> (Note: This is not a 3-star as it has only one edge)
8. <7, (0, 1, 3)>
9. <8, (2)> (Note: This is not a 3-star as it has only one edge)

Therefore, there are [4] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
