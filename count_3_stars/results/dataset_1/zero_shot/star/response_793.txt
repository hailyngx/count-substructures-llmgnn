Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

Here are the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (5, 6, 8)>
<2, (1, 5, 7)>
<5, (0, 2, 6)>
<7, (3, 4, 9)>
