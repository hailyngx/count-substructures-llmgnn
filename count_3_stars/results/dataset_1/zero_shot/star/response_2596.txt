Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are as follows:
- <1, (2, 3, 8)>
- <2, (1, 6, 7)>
- <4, (6, 7, 9)>
- <6, (2, 4, 5)>
- <8, (1, 9, 9)>
- <9, (6, 8, 8)>

There are a total of [6] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
