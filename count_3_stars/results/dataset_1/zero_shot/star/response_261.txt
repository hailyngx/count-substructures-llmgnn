Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 3-stars present in the given graph. Here is the list of unique 3-stars: 

<0, (6, 9, 1)>
<1, (2, 4, 8)>
<2, (1, 3, 9)>
<3, (2, 5, 6)>
<4, (1, 5, 9)>
<5, (3, 4, 6)>
<6, (0, 3, 5)>
<7, (1, 9, 8)>
<8, (1, 9, 7)>
<9, (6, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
