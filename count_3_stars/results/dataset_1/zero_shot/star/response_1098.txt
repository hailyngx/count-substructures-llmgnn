Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The graph contains 3-star patterns at the following nodes:
[<0, (7, 9, 0)>, <4, (3, 9, 4)>, <5, (1, 2, 5)>, <5, (1, 4, 5)>, <5, (2, 4, 5)>, <5, (4, 7, 5)>, <5, (7, 8, 5)>, <6, (7, 8, 6)>]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
