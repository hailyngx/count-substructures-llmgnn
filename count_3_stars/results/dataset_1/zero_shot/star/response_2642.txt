Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph can be determined by identifying all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Upon examining the provided edges, the 3-stars in this graph are as follows:
<0, (2, 5, 7)>
<1, (3, 5, 6)>
<2, (0, 8, 9)>
<3, (1, 8, 0)>
<4, (8, 9, 0)>
<5, (0, 1, 8)>
<6, (1, 5, 0)>
<7, (0, 8, 0)>
<8, (2, 3, 4)>
<9, (2, 4, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
