Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated by finding the number of nodes that can act as the center of the 3-star since each center can form a unique 3-star. 

Let's go through the nodes and check if they can form a 3-star:
- Node 0 has 4 adjacent nodes (1, 6, 8, 9).
  <0, (1, 6, 8)> can form a 3-star.
- Node 1 has 4 adjacent nodes (0, 2, 3, 5).
  <1, (0, 2, 3)> can form a 3-star.
- Node 2 has 5 adjacent nodes (1, 3, 4, 5, 9).
  <2, (1, 3, 5)> can form a 3-star.
- Node 3 has 3 adjacent nodes (1, 2).
- Node 4 has 4 adjacent nodes (2, 7, 8, 9).
  <4, (2, 8, 9)> can form a 3-star.
- Node 5 has 2 adjacent nodes (1, 2).
- Node 6 has 3 adjacent nodes (0, 7, 8).
- Node 7 has 2 adjacent nodes (4, 6).
- Node 8 has 4 adjacent nodes (0, 4, 6, 9).
  <8, (0, 4, 9)> can form a 3-star.
- Node 9 has 4 adjacent nodes (0, 2, 4, 8).

Therefore, there are [3] 3-stars in the given graph, which are <0, (1, 6, 8)>, <1, (0, 2, 3)>, and <4, (2, 8, 9)>.
