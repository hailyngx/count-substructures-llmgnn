Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 6 3-star graphs in the given graph. Here are the unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 6, 8)>
<1, (0, 6, 8)>
<2, (4, 5, 8)>
<3, (1, 7, 6)>
<4, (2, 8, 5)>
<5, (2, 6, 8)>
The final answer is [6].
