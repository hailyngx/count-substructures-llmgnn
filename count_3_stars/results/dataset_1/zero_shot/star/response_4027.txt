Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].  
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:  
<0, (1, 4, 5)>  
<1, (0, 6, 9)>  
<2, (3, 4, 8)>  
<3, (0, 2, 8)>  
<4, (0, 2, 5)>  
<5, (0, 2, 4)>  
<6, (1, 9, 2)>  
<7, (4, 0, 9)>  
<8, (2, 3, 4)>  
<9, (2, 6, 7)>
