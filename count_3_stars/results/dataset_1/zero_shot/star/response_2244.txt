Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:   
<[0, (4, 5, 6)]>  
<[1, (5, 6, 9)]>  
<[2, (4, 6, 8)]>  
<[3, (7, 8, 9)]>  
<[4, (0, 2, 9)]>  
<[5, (0, 1, 8)]>  
<[6, (0, 1, 9)]>  
<[7, (1, 3, 6)]>  
<[8, (0, 2, 5)]>  
<[9, (1, 3, 4)]>  

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [10].
