Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.

<0, (4, 8, 9)>
<3, (4, 7, 9)>
<6, (5, 7, 8)>
<7, (1, 2, 4)>
