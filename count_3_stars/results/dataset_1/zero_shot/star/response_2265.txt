Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 1) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are:
<1, (2, 5, 6)>
<1, (3, 7, 8)>
<2, (1, 3, 4)>
<2, (9, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
