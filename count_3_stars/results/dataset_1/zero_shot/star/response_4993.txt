Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph, the count is [4]. 

<0, (1, 6, 8)>
<1, (0, 2, 8)>
<4, (3, 5, 6)>
<9, (2, 5, 6)>
