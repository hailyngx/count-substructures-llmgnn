Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are a total of 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (5, 6, 9)>
<1, (3, 6, 7)>
<2, (3, 5, 8)>
<4, (8, 9, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
