Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 3-star structures with the following central nodes and leaf nodes in this graph:

<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<1, (0, 4, 5)>
<3, (5, 7, 8)>
<4, (0, 1, 5)>
<5, (1, 3, 9)>
<6, (0, 2, 8)>
<7, (0, 3, 9)>
<8, (2, 3, 6)>
<9, (1, 5, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
