Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here is the list of unique 3-stars found:

<0, (1, 8, 9)>
<1, (0, 4, 6)>
<3, (4, 6, 8)>
<4, (1, 3, 9)>
<6, (1, 3, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
