Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are <0, (3, 8, 9)>, <4, (3, 6, 7)>, <5, (1, 7, 8)>, and <7, (2, 4, 5)>.
