Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are two 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are:

<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<1, (2, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
