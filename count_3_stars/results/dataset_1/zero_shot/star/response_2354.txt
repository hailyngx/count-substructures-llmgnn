Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph.<0, (2, 4, 6)><2, (0, 5, 7)>. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
