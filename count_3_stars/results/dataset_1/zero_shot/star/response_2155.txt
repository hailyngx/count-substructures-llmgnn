Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There is 1 unique 3-star in the given graph. Thus, the answer is [1].

The unique 3-star found in this graph is <2, (1, 3, 4)>.
