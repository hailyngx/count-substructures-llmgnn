Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (7, 9, 5)>
<1, (5, 6, 2)>
<2, (6, 7, 0)>
<5, (1, 9, 4)>
<7, (0, 8, 2)>
<9, (0, 5, 7)>
