Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 8, -)>
<1, (3, 5, 6)>
<1, (5, 7, -)>
<1, (6, 7, -)>
<1, (7, 9, -)>
<2, (0, 4, 5)>
