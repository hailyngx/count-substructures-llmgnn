Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 3) (9, 2) 

Response:
There are 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph: 
<0, (2, 6, 7)>
<1, (3, 5, 7)>
<2, (0, 4, 9)>
<3, (1, 8, x)>
<4, (2, 6, x)>

[There are a total of 5 3-stars in the given graph.]
