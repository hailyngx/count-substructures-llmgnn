Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 0) (7, 2) (8, 4) (9, 3) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:

[<0, (2, 5, 6)>, <2, (0, 4, 7)>, <4, (1, 2, 8)>] 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
