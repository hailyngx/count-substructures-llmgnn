Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be calculated by counting the number of nodes that can be the center of a 3-star. Since a 3-star has one central node and three leaves, any node with degree 3 or more can potentially be the center of a 3-star.

From the given edges, the degrees of each node are as follows:
- Node 0: degree = 2
- Node 1: degree = 2
- Node 2: degree = 3
- Node 3: degree = 3
- Node 5: degree = 5
- Node 6: degree = 5
- Node 7: degree = 1
- Node 8: degree = 1
- Node 9: degree = 6

Nodes 5, 6, and 9 can potentially be the center of a 3-star due to their degree being 3 or more.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].

The unique 3-stars are:
<5, (0, 3, 6)>
<6, (1, 5, 9)>
<9, (2, 3, 6)>
