Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 0) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 4 3-stars in the given graph. 
The 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<0, (5, 4, 7)>
<3, (7, 8, 6)>
<5, (0, 9, 4)>

So, the final answer is [4].
