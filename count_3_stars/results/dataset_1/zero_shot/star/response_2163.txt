Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are five 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are:

1. <0, (3, 4, 6)>
2. <2, (4, 5, 8)>
3. <5, (2, 7, 9)>
4. <6, (0, 1, 9)>
5. <9, (5, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
