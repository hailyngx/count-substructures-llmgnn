Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-star graphs in the given graph can be calculated by identifying all instances where a node connects to exactly three other nodes. 

There are 3 unique 3-star graphs in the given graph:
1. <0, (2, 4, 7)>
2. <3, (2, 6, 7)>
3. <9, (8, 3, -)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [3].
