Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are [14] 3-star structures in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 6, 8)>
<1, (9, 3, 5)>
<2, (0, 8, 3)>
<3, (4, 5, 6)>
<3, (5, 3, 9)>
<3, (6, 4, 9)>
<4, (3, 5, 6)>
<5, (3, 4, 9)>
<6, (0, 3, 4)>
<9, (1, 3, 5)>
<9, (3, 5, 6)>
<9, (5, 9, 1)>
<9, (6, 3, 5)>
<9, (9, 1, 6)>
