Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are 3 unique 3-stars in the given graph:
1. <1, (0, 6, 9)>
2. <2, (3, 8, 9)>
3. <4, (7, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
