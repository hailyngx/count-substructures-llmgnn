Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are four 3-star graphs in the given graph. Here are the details of each 3-star:
1. <0, (2, 4, 5)>
2. <3, (1, 5, 6)>
3. <5, (0, 3, 7)>
4. <7, (0, 2, 5)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
