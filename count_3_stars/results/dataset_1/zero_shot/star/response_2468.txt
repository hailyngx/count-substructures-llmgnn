Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph.
The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 6, 9)>
<2, (3, 5, 8)>
<3, (2, 6, 9)>
<8, (2, 4, 5)>
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
