Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The total number of 3-star configurations can be found by counting the number of nodes that can act as the center of a 3-star. In this case, we can consider nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 as potential centers.

By looking at the edges given, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<0, (9, 6, 9)>
<1, (0, 9, 1)>
<2, (0, 4, 7)>
<3, (0, 4, 9)>
<4, (2, 3, 5)>
<4, (6, 7, 5)>
<6, (0, 4, 7)>
<6, (6, 7, 8)>
<6, (9, 0, 6)>
<9, (0, 1, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [12].
