Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:
[<0, (1, 2, 5)>, <1, (0, 4, 9)>, <2, (0, 4, 8)>, <4, (1, 2, 3)>, <5, (0, 9, 5)>, <6, (4, 8, 6)>, <8, (2, 6, 9)>, <9, (1, 2, 5)>]

Therefore, there are 8 3-stars in the given graph.
