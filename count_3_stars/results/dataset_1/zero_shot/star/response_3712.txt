Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 0) (8, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The given graph consists of the following 3-stars:
[<0, (2, 6, 7)>, <0, (2, 6, 8)>, <2, (0, 1, 3)>, <2, (0, 5, 9)>, <2, (1, 3, 9)>, <2, (3, 5, 9)>, <9, (2, 4, 3)>]
