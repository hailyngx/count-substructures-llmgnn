Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph is as follows:

- Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Edges: (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 7), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 8), (4, 9), (5, 7), (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 3), (7, 1), (7, 5), (7, 8), (7, 9), (8, 4), (8, 7), (8, 9), (9, 4), (9, 7), (9, 8)

Since a 3-star graph consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we need to identify the 3-stars within this graph. 

There are <0, (3, 4, 6)>, <1, (3, 4, 7)>, and <4, (1, 8, 9)> as the unique 3-stars in this graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
