Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 9) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the count of 3-stars is [6].

Here are the unique 3-stars:
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<1, (4, 6, 8)>
<2, (3, 4, 9)>
<3, (0, 2, 4)>
<4, (0, 1, 3)>
<6, (0, 1, 9)>
