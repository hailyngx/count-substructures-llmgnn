Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars and the count is given inside brackets:

<0, (2, 5, 9)>  
<2, (0, 5, 6)>  
<3, (0, 4, 9)>  
<4, (2, 3, 5)>  
<5, (0, 2, 9)>  [4]
