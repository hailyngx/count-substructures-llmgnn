Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph contains the following 3-stars:

[<0, (1, 3, 7)>, <0, (1, 8, 9)>, <2, (1, 3, 9)>, <2, (3, 4, 5)>, <6, (7, 9, 0)>]
