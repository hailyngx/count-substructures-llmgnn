Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [2] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<3, (1, 2, 4)>
