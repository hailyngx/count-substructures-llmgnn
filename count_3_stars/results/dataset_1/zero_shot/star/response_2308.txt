Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<0, (1, 6, 8)>
<1, (0, 4, 7)>
<2, (6, 8, 9)>
