Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes.

From the given edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<1, (3, 5, 6)>
<2, (3, 4, 6)>
<3, (1, 2, 5)>
<4, (2, 7, 8)>
<5, (1, 3, 6)>
<6, (0, 1, 2)>
<7, (4, 5, 8)>
<8, (4, 5, 6)>
<9, (7, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
