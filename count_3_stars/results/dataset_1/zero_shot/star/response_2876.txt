Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the central nodes and their connected leaves. 

The central nodes are the nodes with exactly 3 neighbors. From the given edges, we can determine the following nodes and their neighbors:
- Node 2: Neighbors {3, 7}
- Node 5: Neighbors {3, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors {2, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 5, 7, 9}

Now, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:
<2, (3, 7, 8)>
<5, (3, 4, 6)>
<5, (3, 4, 8)>
<5, (4, 5, 8)>
<8, (1, 5, 7)>
<8, (5, 7, 9)>

Thus, there are a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
