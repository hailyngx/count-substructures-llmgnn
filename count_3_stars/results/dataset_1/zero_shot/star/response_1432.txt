Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are [7] 3-stars in the given graph. 
The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 3, 9)>
<1, (0, 2, 7)>
<2, (1, 7, 7)>
<3, (0, 6, 9)>
<4, (5, 6, 8)>
<5, (4, 6, 8)>
<6, (3, 4, 9)>
