Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 5) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [16] edges in total. 

The number of 3-stars can be determined by counting the number of nodes that can be the center of a 3-star in the given graph. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the given graph:

<0, (4, 7, 5)>
<1, (6, 9, 5)>
<3, (5, 7, 6)>
<4, (0, 7, 5)>
<5, (7, 3, 6)>
<6, (1, 5, 7)>
<7, (9, 5, 0)>
<9, (1, 7, 6)>

Therefore, there are [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
