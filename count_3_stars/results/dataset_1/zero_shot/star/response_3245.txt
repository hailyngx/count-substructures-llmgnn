Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [3] 3-stars in the given graph.  
The unique 3-stars are: <0, (4, 6, 9)>, <1, (2, 7, 9)>, <7, (1, 2, 9)>.
