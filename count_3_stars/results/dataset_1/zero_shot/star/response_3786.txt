Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are <0, (1, 8, 9)>, <1, (0, 3, 5)>, <2, (0, 3, 6)>, and <8, (0, 4, 7)> 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
