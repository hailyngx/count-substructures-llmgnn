Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are `[13]` 3-stars in the given graph.  
The unique 3-stars are:  
<0, (1, 4, 7)>
<0, (1, 7, 9)>
<0, (4, 1, 8)>
<0, (7, 3, 9)>
<1, (0, 4, 9)>
<1, (2, 4, 9)>
<2, (1, 5, 8)>
<3, (2, 6, 8)>
<3, (6, 7, 8)>
<3, (6, 7, 9)>
<4, (0, 1, 8)>
<7, (0, 3, 5)>
<8, (0, 2, 4)>
