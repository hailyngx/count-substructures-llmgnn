Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of [4] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (4, 9, 6)>
<1, (7, 6, 9)>
<3, (2, 8, 9)>
<8, (5, 6, 9)>
