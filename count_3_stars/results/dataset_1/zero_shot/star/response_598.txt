Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 6) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 3 unique 3-stars found in the given graph:
<6, (0, 1, 5)>
<4, (3, 7, 8)>
<8, (4, 9, 3)>

Therefore, the final answer is [3].
