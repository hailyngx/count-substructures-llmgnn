Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 6, 9)>
<1, (4, 6, 8)>
<2, (3, 6, 9)>
<3, (0, 2, 6)>
