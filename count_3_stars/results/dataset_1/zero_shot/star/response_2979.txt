Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 8 total 3-stars in this graph. Here are the unique 3-stars found:

[<0, (2, 5, 6)>, <1, (3, 4, 7)>, <2, (0, 3, 6)>, <3, (1, 2, 5)>, <4, (1, 7, 9)>, <5, (3, 6, 7)>, <6, (0, 2, 5)>, <7, (1, 4, 5)>]
