Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<1, (2, 7, 8)>
<2, (0, 1, 5)>
<3, (0, 6, 9)>
<4, (0, 7, 8)>
<8, (1, 2, 9)>
