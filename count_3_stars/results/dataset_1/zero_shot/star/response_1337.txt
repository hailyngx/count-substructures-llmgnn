Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are:

<0, (4, 5, 2)>
<1, (8, 2, 0)>
<4, (0, 5, 7)>
<5, (0, 4, 6)>
<8, (1, 2, 5)>
<9, (2, 3, 5)>

Therefore, the final answer is [6].
