Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (7, 4, 2)>
<3, (4, 7, 5)>
<4, (3, 7, 1)>
<5, (7, 8, 6)>
