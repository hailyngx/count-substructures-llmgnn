Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 3 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<1, (6, 8, 9)>
<2, (4, 5, 7)>

Therefore, the final answer is [3].
