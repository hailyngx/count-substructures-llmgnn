Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:
<0, (3, 4, 9)>
<1, (6, 8, 9)>
<2, (3, 6, 8)>
<3, (0, 2, 4)>
<4, (0, 3, 5)>
<5, (3, 8, 9)>
<6, (1, 2, 8)>
<7, (6, 9, 3)>
<8, (1, 5, 6)>
<9, (0, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
