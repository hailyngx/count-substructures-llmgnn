Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are <0, (2, 6, 8)>, <1, (2, 6, 7)>, <2, (0, 1, 6)>, <3, (4, 6, 8)>, <4, (3, 5, 6)>, <5, (4, 8, 9)>, <6, (0, 1, 2)>, <7, (1, 3, 6)>, <8, (0, 2, 3)>, and <9, (2, 3, 5)> as the 3-stars in the given graph.  
Therefore, there are [10] 3-stars in total.
