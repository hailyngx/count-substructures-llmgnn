Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 1) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (3, 4, 8)>
<1, (5, 8, 9)>
<2, (4, 7, -)>
<3, (0, 6, 8)>
<4, (0, 2, 7)>
<5, (1, 6, -)>
<6, (3, 5, -)>
