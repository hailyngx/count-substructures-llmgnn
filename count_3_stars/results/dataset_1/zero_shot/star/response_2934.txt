Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are a total of [4] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<4, (0, 2, 5)>
<5, (4, 8, 9)>
<9, (2, 4, 7)>
