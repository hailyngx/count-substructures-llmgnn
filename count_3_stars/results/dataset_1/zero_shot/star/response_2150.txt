Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 9) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are <0, (1, 7, 8)>, <1, (0, 7, 8)>, <6, (8, 9, 7)>, and <8, (6, 1, 7)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
