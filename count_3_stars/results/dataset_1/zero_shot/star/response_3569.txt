Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (3, 1) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are:

<0, (1, 2, 9)>
<1, (0, 3, 5)>
<5, (1, 4, 9)>
<7, (1, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
