Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The count is shown below:

\[4\]

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 5, 9)>
<3, (6, 9, 5)>
<5, (0, 4, 6)>
<8, (1, 6, 7)>
