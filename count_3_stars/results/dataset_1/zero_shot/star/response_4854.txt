Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be found by counting the number of times a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

From the given graph, there are three 3-stars: 
<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<1, (2, 5, 9)>
<3, (2, 4, 9)>

Therefore, the final answer is [3].
