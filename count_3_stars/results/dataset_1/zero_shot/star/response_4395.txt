Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 6 3-stars in the given graph:

[6]

Here are the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (1, 5, 9)>
<1, (0, 5, 6)>
<2, (1, 6, 8)>
<4, (1, 4, 7)>
<5, (0, 1, 3)>
<8, (1, 2, 6)>
