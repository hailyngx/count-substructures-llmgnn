Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-star structures:
1. <0, (1, 5, 8)>
2. <1, (0, 5, 8)>
3. <3, (1, 2, 6)>
4. <4, (1, 6, 8)>
5. <5, (0, 1, 9)>
6. <8, (0, 1, 4)>
7. <9, (1, 3, 5)>

Therefore, there are a total of [7] 3-stars in the given graph.
