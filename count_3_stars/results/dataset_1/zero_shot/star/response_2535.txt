Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 1, 4)>
<1, (3, 0, 5)>
<1, (3, 7, 9)>
<3, (0, 1, 6)>
<4, (1, 5, 6)>
<5, (2, 1, 4)>
