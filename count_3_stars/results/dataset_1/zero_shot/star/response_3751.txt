Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are a total of [12] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<0, (2, 3, 8)>
<2, (0, 3, 8)>
<2, (3, 8, 9)>
<3, (1, 2, 4)>
<3, (2, 4, 8)>
<4, (0, 2, 8)>
<5, (7, 9, 6)>
<9, (2, 3, 6)>
<9, (3, 5, 6)>
<9, (5, 6, 7)>
