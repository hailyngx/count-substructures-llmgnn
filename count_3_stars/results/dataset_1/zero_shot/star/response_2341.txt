Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph. 

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (4, 7, 8)>
<1, (2, 5, 6)>
<4, (0, 3, 9)>
<8, (0, 1, 7)>
