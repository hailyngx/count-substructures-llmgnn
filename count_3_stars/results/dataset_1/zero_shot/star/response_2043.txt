Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are as follows: 
[<0, (3, 7, 9)>, <1, (2, 6, 7)>, <3, (0, 8, 9)>, <6, (1, 4, 8)>, <8, (3, 5, 6)>]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
