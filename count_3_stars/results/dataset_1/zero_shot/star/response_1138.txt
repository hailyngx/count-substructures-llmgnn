Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are a total of [3] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (4, 5, 1)>
<2, (1, 3, 8)>
<4, (0, 9, 5)>
