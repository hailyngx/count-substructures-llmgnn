Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 2) 

Response:
There are [5] 3-stars in the given graph.  

The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (1, 5, 9)>
<3, (6, 7, 8)>
<4, (0, 2, 7)>
<5, (1, 2, 5)>
<6, (3, 6, 8)>
