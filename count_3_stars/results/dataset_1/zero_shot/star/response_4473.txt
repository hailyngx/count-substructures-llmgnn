Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of 3-star subgraphs in the given graph is [12].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 4, 7)>
<0, (4, 7, 9)>
<0, (7, 5, 9)>
<0, (7, 6, 9)>
<3, (0, 2, 4)>
<4, (0, 2, 3)>
<7, (0, 5, 9)>
<7, (5, 6, 9)>
<9, (0, 4, 7)>
<9, (2, 4, 6)>
<9, (4, 5, 7)>
<9, (5, 6, 7)>
