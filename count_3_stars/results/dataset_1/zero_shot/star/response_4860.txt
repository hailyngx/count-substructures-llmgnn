Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
  
The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (5, 6, 7)>
<1, (4, 9, 1)>
<2, (5, 7, 2)>
<3, (8, 3, )>
<4, (1, 9, 5)>
<5, (0, 6, 7)>
