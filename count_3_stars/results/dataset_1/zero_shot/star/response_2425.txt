Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 8 different 3-stars in the given graph. The list of unique 3-stars is as follows:

<0, (9, 4, 1)>
<1, (2, 4, 7)>
<2, (1, 7, 4)>
<3, (6, 7, 9)>
<4, (1, 7, 6)>
<5, (6, 7, 8)>
<6, (3, 4, 7)>
<7, (1, 2, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
