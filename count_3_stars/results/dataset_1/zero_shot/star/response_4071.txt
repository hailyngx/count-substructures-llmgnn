Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The given graph contains the following 3-stars:
[<0, (1, 7, 0)>, <1, (0, 8, 9)>, <2, (3, 5, 9)>, <5, (2, 3, 9)>, <7, (0, 4, 5)>, <9, (1, 2, 3)>]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
