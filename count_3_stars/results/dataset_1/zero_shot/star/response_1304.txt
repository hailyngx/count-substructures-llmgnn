Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (7, 8, 3)>
<1, (5, 9, 4)>
<4, (5, 9, 1)>
<5, (1, 4, 9)>
