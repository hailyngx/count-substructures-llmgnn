Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (4, 2) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) 

Response:
There are 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph:  

<0, (1, 2, 7)>  
<2, (0, 4, 8)>  

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
