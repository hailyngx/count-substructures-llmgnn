Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 8) (2, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the answer is [4].
  
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (8, 5, 6)>
<2, (6, 7, 9)>
<5, (7, 6, 8)>
<6, (2, 7, 9)>
