Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (2, 6, 7)>
<3, (4, 6, 9)>
<4, (3, 6, 9)>
<6, (1, 3, 4)>
