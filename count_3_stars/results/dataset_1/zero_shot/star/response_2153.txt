Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The 3-stars are as follows:
<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<0, (3, 4, 9)>
<1, (3, 4, 9)>
<2, (0, 4, 5)>
