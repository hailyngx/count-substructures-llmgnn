Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 3, 8)>
<7, (2, 3, 9)>
