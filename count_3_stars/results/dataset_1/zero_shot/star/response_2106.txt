Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 3-stars in such a graph. Here is the calculation:

1. Node 0: <0, (2, 4, 6)>
2. Node 1: <1, (4, 6, 7)>
3. Node 2: <2, (0, 4, 6)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
