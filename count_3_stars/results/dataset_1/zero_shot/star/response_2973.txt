Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 3) (8, 1) 

Response:
The given graph has the following edges:

(1, 3), (1, 8), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 5), (3, 7), (4, 6), (5, 3), (5, 6), (6, 4), (6, 5), (7, 3), (8, 1)

To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify unique occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<1, (3, 8, 2)>
<3, (1, 2, 5)>
<3, (1, 2, 7)>
<3, (2, 5, 7)>
<3, (5, 6, 7)>
  
There are 5 unique 3-stars in this graph. Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
