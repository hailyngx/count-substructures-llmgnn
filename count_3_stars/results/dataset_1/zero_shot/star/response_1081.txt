Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<0, (1, 4, 9)>
<2, (0, 3, 8)>
<8, (1, 2, 4)>
