Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are <0, (2, 7, 9)>, <2, (0, 7, 9)>, <3, (4, 5, 9)>, <4, (1, 3, 5)>, <5, (3, 4, 6)>, <6, (4, 5, 7)>, and <9, (0, 3, 4)>. 
As there are 7 unique 3-star configurations, the total number of 3-stars is [7].
