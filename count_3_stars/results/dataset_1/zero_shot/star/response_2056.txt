Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the graph. 

The 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 4, 7)>
<1, (4, 6, 7)>
<2, (0, 5, 7)>
<9, (3, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
