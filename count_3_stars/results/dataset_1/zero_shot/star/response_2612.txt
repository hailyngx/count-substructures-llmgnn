Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The 3-stars are:

<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<1, (0, 6, 5)>
<2, (3, 4, 8)>
<5, (0, 1, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [4].
