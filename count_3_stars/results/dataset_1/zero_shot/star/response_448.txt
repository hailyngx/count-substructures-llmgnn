Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<2, (0, 4, 5)>
<5, (1, 2, 9)>
