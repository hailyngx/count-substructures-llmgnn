Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of 3-star structures in this graph is [3].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (3, 6, 9)>
<1, (3, 5, 6)>
<2, (7, 8, 9)>
