Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [12] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 5, 3)>
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<1, (2, 4, 7)>
<2, (1, 4, 9)>
<3, (1, 5, 0)>
<4, (2, 8, 7)>
<4, (5, 8, 7)>
<5, (0, 1, 3)>
<7, (1, 4, 9)>
<8, (2, 4, 5)>
<8, (4, 5, 6)>
<9, (2, 7, 4)>
