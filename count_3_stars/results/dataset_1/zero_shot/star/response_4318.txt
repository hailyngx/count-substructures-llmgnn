Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-star configurations:
\[6\]
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<1, (0, 7, 9)>
<2, (0, 4, 6)>
<3, (0, 4, 6)>
<4, (2, 3, 5)>
<7, (1, 6, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 3)> 

Therefore, there are a total of [7] 3-stars in the given graph.
