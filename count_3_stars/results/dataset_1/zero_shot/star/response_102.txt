Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 6, 8)>
<1, (2, 5, 6)>
<2, (0, 1, 6)>
<9, (1, 7, 9)>
