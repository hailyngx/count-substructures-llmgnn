Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 8) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are <0, (6, 9)> 3-stars in the given graph. 
    There are <4, (3, 7, 8)> 3-stars in the given graph.
    There are <6, (0, 4, 5)> 3-stars in the given graph. 
    There are <7, (3, 4, 8)> 3-stars in the given graph. 
    There are <8, (1, 2, 4)> 3-stars in the given graph. 
    There are <9, (0, 4, 7)> 3-stars in the given graph.
