Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 4) (4, 3) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
The central node of a 3-star graph will always have degree 3 because it is connected to exactly three other nodes. Given the graph details, we can identify the central nodes and the nodes connected to them to determine the 3-stars.

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 6.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 7.

Hence, we have the following 3-stars:
<0, (1, 2)>
<2, (0, 1, 6)>
<6, (2, 5, 7)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
