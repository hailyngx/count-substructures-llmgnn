Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 3-star graphs present in this given graph. Here is the list of unique 3-stars:

<1, (0, 3, 5)>
<1, (3, 5, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
