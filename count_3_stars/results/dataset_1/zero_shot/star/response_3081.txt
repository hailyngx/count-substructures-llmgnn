Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are 4 3-stars in the given graph. The unique 3-stars are:

<0, (6, 7, 1)>
<4, (3, 6, 8)>
<5, (1, 8, 7)>
<8, (4, 5, 3)>

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
