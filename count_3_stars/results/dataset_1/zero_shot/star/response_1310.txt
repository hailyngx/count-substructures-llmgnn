Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 1) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 3, 6)>
<0, (2, 3, 9)>
<1, (0, 5, 7)>
<1, (8, 5, 7)>
<2, (0, 3, 4)>
<4, (2, 9, 4)>
