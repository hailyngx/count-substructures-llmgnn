Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph.  

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (5, 2, 3)>
<1, (2, 3, 5)>
<2, (1, 5, 8)>
<5, (0, 2, 8)>
<8, (2, 4, 5)>
<9, (6, 7, 8)>
