Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (8, 1) 

Response:
The central node must have degree 3 in order to form a 3-star. Let's identify the central nodes first:

- Node 0 has degree 3 with neighbors 1, 3, and 4.
- Node 1 has degree 3 with neighbors 0, 6, and 8.
- Node 3 has degree 3 with neighbors 0, 4, and 6.
- Node 4 has degree 2.
- Node 6 has degree 2.
- Node 8 has degree 1.

There are no eligible central nodes among nodes 2, 5, and 8.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found in this graph:

<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<1, (0, 6, 8)>
<3, (0, 4, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
