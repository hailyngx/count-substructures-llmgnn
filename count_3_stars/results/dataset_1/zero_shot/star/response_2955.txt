Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 8) (7, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 4, 7)>
<2, (8, 9, 3)>
<3, (0, 4, 5)>
<8, (2, 5, 6)>
