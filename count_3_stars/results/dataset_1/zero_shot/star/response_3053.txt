Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph. The unique 3-stars are:

<0, (1, 2, 7)>
<1, (0, 2, 5)>
<1, (2, 5, 6)>
<1, (5, 6, 9)>
<5, (1, 2, 6)>
<6, (1, 3, 9)>
