Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are \[6\] total 3-stars in the given graph. 

Here are the unique 3-stars found:
<1, (5, 7, -)>
<2, (4, 6, 7)>
<3, (5, 6, 8)>
