Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 44 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 24 unique 3-star configurations in the given graph. Here they are listed inside <> brackets:

<0, (3, 4, 8)>
<1, (2, 5, 8)>
<1, (3, 5, 8)>
<1, (8, 5, 9)>
<2, (1, 5, 8)>
<2, (5, 1, 9)>
<2, (6, 7, 9)>
<3, (0, 4, 8)>
<3, (1, 4, 8)>
<3, (4, 0, 6)>
<4, (0, 3, 8)>
<4, (6, 2, 7)>
<5, (1, 2, 8)>
<5, (2, 1, 9)>
<5, (8, 1, 9)>
<6, (2, 4, 7)>
<6, (4, 7, 9)>
<7, (2, 4, 6)>
<7, (3, 4, 6)>
<8, (1, 3, 5)>
<8, (4, 5, 9)>
<9, (2, 5, 6)>
<9, (4, 5, 6)>
<9, (5, 4, 6)>

Therefore, the final answer is [24].
