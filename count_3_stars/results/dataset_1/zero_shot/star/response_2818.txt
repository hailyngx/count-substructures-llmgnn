Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 6, 8)>
<1, (2, 5, 6)>
<2, (0, 1, 5)>
<3, (7, 8, 9)>
<4, (8, 9, 5)>
