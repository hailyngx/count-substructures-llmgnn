Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 3) (7, 2) (7, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 2, 9)>
<2, (0, 3, 7)>
<3, (1, 2, 5)>
<3, (0, 2, 9)>
<7, (2, 4, 7)>
<9, (0, 3, 9)>
