Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 3-star graphs in the given graph. Let's list and count them:

- <1, (2, 4, 9)>
- <2, (1, 4, 5)>
- <3, (0, 2, 7)>
- <4, (1, 2, 8)>
- <9, (1, 3, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
