Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of 3-star subgraphs in the given graph is [5].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 5, 9)>
<2, (8, 6, 5)>
<4, (6, 5, 9)>
<5, (3, 6, 9)>
<6, (4, 5, 8)>
