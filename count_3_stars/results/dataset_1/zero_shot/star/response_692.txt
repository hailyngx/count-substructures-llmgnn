Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 3-star patterns with 0, 3, 4, 6, and 9 as central nodes:
- <0, (2, 5, 7)>
- <3, (2, 4, 7)>
- <4, (2, 6, 5)>
- <6, (3, 4, 9)>
- <9, (6, 7, 9)>

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
