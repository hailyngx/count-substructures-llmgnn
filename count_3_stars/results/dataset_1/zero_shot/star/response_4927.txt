Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [3] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<3, (1, 2, 6)>
<5, (8, 9, 6)>
<7, (8, 3, 6)>
