Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<2, (1, 4, 8)>
<2, (1, 7, 9)>
<2, (3, 5, 7)>
<2, (5, 6, 7)>
<2, (6, 0, 7)>
<2, (6, 1, 9)>
<2, (7, 3, 9)>
<2, (7, 5, 9)>
<2, (8, 1, 9)>
<3, (2, 7, 9)>
<6, (0, 5, 7)>
<7, (2, 1, 9)>
