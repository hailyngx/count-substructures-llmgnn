Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 46 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:

[<0, (1, 6, 9)>, <1, (0, 6, 7)>, <2, (1, 3, 5)>, <3, (1, 2, 6)>, <6, (0, 1, 4)>, <7, (1, 3, 9)>, <8, (2, 3, 6)>, <9, (0, 6, 7)>]

Therefore, there are a total of [8] 3-stars in the graph.
