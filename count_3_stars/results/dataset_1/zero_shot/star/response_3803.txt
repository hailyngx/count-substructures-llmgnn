Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 6, 7)>
<0, (7, 8, 6)>
<7, (0, 4, 8)>
<8, (0, 7, 9)>
