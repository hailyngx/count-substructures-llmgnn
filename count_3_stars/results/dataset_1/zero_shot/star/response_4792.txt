Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 3-stars in this graph. The unique 3-stars found are:

<0, (1, 3, 8)>
<1, (0, 5, 8)>
<3, (0, 2, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
