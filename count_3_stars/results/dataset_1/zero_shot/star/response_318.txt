Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 3-star structures in the given graph. Here is the count of 3-stars in the graph: 

[<0, (1, 2, 5)>, <1, (0, 2, 5)>, <3, (1, 4, 6)>]
