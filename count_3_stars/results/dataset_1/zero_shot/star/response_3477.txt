Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

```
              1
              |
              3
             / \
            0   8--5
             \ / \ 
              2   7--9
                  |
                  4
```

There are a total of 8 distinct 3-stars in the graph. Each 3-star is as follows:
<0, (2, 4, 7)>
<0, (3, 4, 7)>
<0, (4, 2, 7)>
<0, (4, 3, 7)>
<2, (0, 4, 7)>
<3, (0, 4, 7)>
<4, (0, 2, 7)>
<7, (0, 2, 4)>

So, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
