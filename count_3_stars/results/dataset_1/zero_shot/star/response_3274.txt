Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 3-star graphs in the given graph. Let's count them.
Finding all the 3-star graphs:

<0, (2, 6, 7)>
<1, (5, 9, 9)>
<7, (0, 9, 9)>
<9, (1, 3, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [4].
