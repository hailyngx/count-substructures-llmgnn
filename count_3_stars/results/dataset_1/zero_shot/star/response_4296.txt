Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
   
   Unique 3-stars:
   <0, (5, 3, 7)>
   <1, (2, 8, 2)>
   <2, (1, 2, 1)>
   <2, (8, 2, 8)>
   <3, (4, 3, 6)>
   <4, (3, 4, 3)>
   <5, (3, 5, 7)>
   <5, (9, 5, 0)>
