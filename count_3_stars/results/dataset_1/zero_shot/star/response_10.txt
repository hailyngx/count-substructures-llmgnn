Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 4, 9)>
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<3, (1, 5, 6)>
<8, (2, 5, 7)>
