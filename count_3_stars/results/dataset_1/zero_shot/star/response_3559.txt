Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<2, (3, 5, 9)>
<3, (2, 5, 7)>
<4, (0, 2, 9)>
<5, (1, 2, 7)>
<7, (1, 3, 5)>
<9, (2, 4, 8)>
