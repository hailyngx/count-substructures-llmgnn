Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (0, 1), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 7), (0, 8), (1, 0), (1, 7), (2, 7), (4, 0), (4, 5), (4, 8), (4, 9), (5, 0), (5, 4), (5, 7), (6, 7), (7, 0), (7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 5), (7, 6), (7, 9), (8, 0), (8, 4), (9, 4), (9, 7)

To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all unique instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

In this graph, the 3-stars are:
<[0, (1, 4, 5)]>, <[4, (0, 5, 8)]>, <[5, (0, 4, 7)]>, <[7, (0, 1, 2)]>, <[7, (0, 5, 6)]>, <[7, (1, 2, 7)]>, <[7, (2, 6, 7)]>, <[7, (4, 5, 9)]>, <[7, (5, 6, 7)]>

So the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
