Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of 3-stars in the graph. Here is the list of unique 3-stars:
  
<0, (3, 2, 4)>
<1, (4, 5, 6)>
<2, (3, 4, 6)>
<3, (0, 2, 6)>
<4, (1, 2, 9)>
<5, (1, 6, 6)>
<6, (3, 5, 8)>
<7, (8, 6, 9)>
<8, (6, 7, 9)>
<9, (4, 6, 8)>
  
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [10].
