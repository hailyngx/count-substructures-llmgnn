Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) 

Response:
There are a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (2, 4, 5)>
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<2, (1, 3, 4)>
<3, (2, 6, 8)>
<4, (2, 7, 8)>
<5, (6, 1, 8)>
<6, (1, 3, 5)>
<8, (1, 3, 6)>
