Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 6) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of [4] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (6, 7, 9)>
<1, (2, 3, 9)>
<3, (1, 8, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 6)>
