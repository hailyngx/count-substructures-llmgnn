Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 5) 

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are as follows:

- <0, (1, 3, 4)>
- <1, (0, 2, 4)>
- <3, (0, 4, 7)>
- <4, (0, 1, 3)>
- <7, (0, 3, 4)>
- <8, (1, 5, 7)>
- <5, (8, 9)>
- <9, (5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
