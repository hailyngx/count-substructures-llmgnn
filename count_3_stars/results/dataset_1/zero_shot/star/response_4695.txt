Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are 3-star subgraphs in the given graph. Let's list them and count how many there are in total:

<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<0, (2, 4, 7)>
<0, (7, 9, 1)>
<3, (0, 2, 9)>
<4, (0, 5, 7)>
<7, (0, 2, 5)>
<9, (0, 1, 4)>

Therefore, there are a total of [7] 3-stars in the graph.
