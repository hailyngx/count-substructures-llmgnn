Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph. 

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (8, 2, 5)>
<1, (2, 3, 7)>
<2, (1, 7, 8)>
<4, (7, 9, 5)>
