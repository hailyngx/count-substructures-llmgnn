Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (2, 9) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (5, 6, 6)>
<2, (9, 9, 9)>
<3, (9, 9, 9)>
<4, (6, 4, 8)>
<5, (1, 5, 6)>
<6, (9, 6, 9)>
