Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 8, -)>
<1, (2, 6, 9)>
<2, (1, 3, 4)>
<3, (0, 2, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
