Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 3-star subgraphs in the graph you provided. The count of 3-stars is [4].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (0, 2, 9)>
<2, (1, 3, 4)>
<3, (2, 5, 8)>
<6, (5, 7, 9)>
