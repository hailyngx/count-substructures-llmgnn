Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 4) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph.

Thus, the answer is: [4]
The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (1, 4, 8)>
<1, (0, 4, 3)>
<3, (4, 5, 8)>
<8, (4, 9, 0)>
