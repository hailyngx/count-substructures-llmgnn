Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph can be visualized as follows:

```plaintext
0 -- 3 -- 5 -- 7
|         |    |
|         |    |
-         -    -
          |
          9
          |
          4 -- 2 -- 6 -- 1
```

To count the number of 3-stars, we need to identify all unique occurrences of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

The 3-stars in this graph are:
1. <0, (3, 5, 7)>
2. <3, (0, 5, 7)>
3. <5, (0, 3, 7)>
4. <7, (0, 3, 5)>
5. <4, (2, 8, 9)>
6. <8, (4, 6, 9)>
7. <9, (4, 6, 7)>
8. <6, (1, 2, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
