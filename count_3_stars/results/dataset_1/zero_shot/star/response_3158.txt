Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are <0, (5, 8, 9)>, <2, (7, 8, 9)>, <3, (7, 8, 9)>, <4, (6, 7, 9)>, <6, (4, 7, 9)>, <7, (2, 3, 6)>, <8, (0, 2, 3)>, <9, (0, 6, 7)>.
Counting these unique 3-stars, we find a total of [8].
