This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 4, 9)>
<2, (1, 6, 7)>
