Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
There are 4 different 3-stars in this graph, which can be represented as follows:
<0, (5, 6, 7)>
<1, (4, 5, 7)>
<2, (3, 9, )>
<3, (2, 5, 7)>
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
