Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
There is a total of 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

The 3-stars are listed below:
<0, (3, 7, 8)>
<1, (4, 5, 6)>
<2, (3, 7, 9)>
<4, (1, 5, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
