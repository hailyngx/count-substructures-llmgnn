Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The 3-stars are <0, (9, 6, 5)> and <3, (8, 7, 6)>. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
