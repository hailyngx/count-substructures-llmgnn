Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 2, 6)>
<1, (0, 2, 6)>
<1, (2, 3, 9)>
<2, (0, 1, 5)>
<2, (1, 5, 7)>
<3, (1, 4, 9)>
