Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 8, 9)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<3, (1, 4, 6)>
<4, (1, 3, 9)>
<5, (7, 9, 6)>
<7, (5, 6, 9)>
<9, (0, 2, 3)>
