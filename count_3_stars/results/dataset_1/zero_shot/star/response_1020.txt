Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.  
The unique 3-stars found are:  
<0, (1, 2, 4)>  
<2, (4, 6, 8)>  
<2, (6, 8, 9)>  
<8, (3, 6, 7)>
