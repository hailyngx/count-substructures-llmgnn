Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in this graph: <0, (1, 3, 7)>, <1, (0, 6, 9)>, <3, (0, 7, 9)>, and <7, (1, 3, 9)>.
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
