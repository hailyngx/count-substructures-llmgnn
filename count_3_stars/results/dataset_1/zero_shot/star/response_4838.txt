Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph.

The four 3-stars are:
<1, (2, 9, 9)>
<3, (0, 4, 5)>
<4, (3, 5, 8)>
<5, (3, 4, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
