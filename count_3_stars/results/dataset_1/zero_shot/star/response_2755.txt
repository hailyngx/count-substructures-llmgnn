Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 3-stars in the given graph. The unique 3-stars are:
    <3, (0, 1, 8)>
    <4, (1, 3, 6)>
    <5, (2, 3, 7)>
    <8, (1, 3, 4)>
Therefore, the final answer is: [4].
