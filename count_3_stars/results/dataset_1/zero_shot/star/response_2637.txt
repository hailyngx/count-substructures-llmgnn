Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<1, (0, 5, 6)>
<4, (0, 3, 6)>
<5, (0, 1, 2)>
<6, (0, 1, 3)>
<8, (1, 5, 6)>
