Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 0) (8, 4) (9, 1) 

Response:
There are a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (5, 6, 1)>
<1, (2, 4, 5)>
<1, (4, 5, 9)>
<4, (1, 8, 9)>
<5, (0, 1, 6)>
<9, (1, 4, 8)>
