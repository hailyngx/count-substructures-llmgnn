Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<1, (0, 2, 5)>
<5, (0, 1, 4)>
<6, (0, 3, 7)>
