Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph.  

The 3-stars are:  
<0, (2, 5, 1)>  
<2, (0, 1, 8)>  
<5, (0, 1, 9)>  
<9, (4, 5, 6)>  

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
