Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph represented by the following unique combinations:
<0, (1, 3, 7)>
<1, (0, 2, 5)>
<2, (1, 3, 8)>
<3, (0, 2, 8)>
<4, (5, 6, 9)>
<5, (1, 4, 6)>
