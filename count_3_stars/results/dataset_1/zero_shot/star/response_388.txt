Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) 

Response:
There are 4 3-stars in the given graph. 

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
The unique 3-stars found are <0, (5, 8, 2)>, <1, (6, 2, 4)>, <3, (8, 2, 4)>, and <7, (4, 7, 2)>.
