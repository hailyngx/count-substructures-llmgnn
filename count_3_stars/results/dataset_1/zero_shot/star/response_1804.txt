Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are <0, (1, 7, 4)>, <1, (0, 2, 7)>, and <2, (1, 3, 5)> 3-stars in the given graph. 
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
