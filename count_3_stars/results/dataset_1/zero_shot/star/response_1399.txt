Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are [2] 3-stars in the given graph.
  
Here are the unique 3-stars:
<0, (4, 5, 8)>
<6, (1, 3, 9)>
