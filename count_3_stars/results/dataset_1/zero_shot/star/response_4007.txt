Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 2) 

Response:
The total number of 3-star structures can be counted by finding all possible combinations of a center node connected to three other nodes.

Given the graph edges:
(0, 4) (0, 6)
(2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9)
(3, 2)
(4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8)
(5, 4) (5, 7)
(6, 0)
(7, 4) (7, 5)
(8, 2) (8, 4)
(9, 2)

The 3-stars in this graph are as follows:
[<0, (4, 6, not connected)>, <2, (4, 8, 9)>, <4, (0, 2, 5)>, <5, (4, 7, not connected)>, <7, (4, 5, not connected)>]

There are 5 unique 3-stars in the graph, so the final answer is:
[5]
