Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The given graph contains the following 3-star configurations:

[<0, (2, 4, 5)>, <2, (0, 4, 8)>, <3, (2, 7, 9)>, <4, (0, 2, 5)>, <7, (3, 4, 6)>, <8, (2, 6, 7)>, <9, (3, 4, 9)>]

Therefore, there are [7] 3-stars in the given graph.
