Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
The 3-stars are: 
<0, (6, 7, 8)>
<3, (4, 5, 7)>
<4, (3, 9, 5)>
<5, (1, 3, 6)> 

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
