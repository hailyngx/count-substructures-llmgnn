Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 9) (4, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 3-stars in the given graph.  
Here are the unique 3-stars present in the graph:
<0, (7, 8, 1)>
<1, (6, 8, 0)>
<6, (1, 4, 8)>
<8, (1, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
