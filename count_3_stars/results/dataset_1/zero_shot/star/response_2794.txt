Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
There are a total of [4] 3-stars in the given graph.  
The unique 3-stars are:  
<0, (1, 6, 7)>  
<2, (3, 7, 9)>  
<4, (1, 5, 7)>  
<5, (1, 2, 4)>
