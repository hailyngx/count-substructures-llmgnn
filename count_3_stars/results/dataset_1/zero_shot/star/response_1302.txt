Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) 

Response:
There are 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph [<0, (2, 3, 6)>, <6, (1, 4, 7)>]. The total count is [2].
