Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

[5]

The 3-stars are:
<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<2, (1, 3, 9)>
<3, (2, 5, 9)>
<5, (0, 3, 6)>
<6, (1, 5, 9)>
