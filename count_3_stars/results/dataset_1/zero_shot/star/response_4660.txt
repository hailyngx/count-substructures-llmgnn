Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 different 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the final answer is [4].
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (4, 6, 2)>
<1, (3, 9, 5)>
<2, (3, 6, 8)>
<3, (1, 2, 8)>
