Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are: 
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<0, (3, 4, 6)>
<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<0, (5, 6, 9)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<4, (0, 2, 8)>
<6, (0, 7, 8)>
<9, (4, 5, 9)>

Therefore, there are a total of [8] 3-stars in the graph.
