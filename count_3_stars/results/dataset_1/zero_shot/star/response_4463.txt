Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are:

<1, (2, 4, 9)>
<4, (1, 6, 7)>
<6, (4, 7, 8)>
<8, (2, 6, 9)>

So, the final answer is [4].
