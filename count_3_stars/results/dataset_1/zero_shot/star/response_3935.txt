Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 3 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The list of unique 3-stars is as follows:

<0, (3, 8, 9)>
<1, (3, 4, 6)>
<5, (4, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
