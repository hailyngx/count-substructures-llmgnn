Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph contains the following 3-star structures:
[<0, (1, 6, 0)>, <1, (0, 6, 1)>, <1, (2, 5, 6)>, <1, (3, 6, 7)>, <1, (4, 7, 1)>, <2, (1, 5, 2)>, <3, (1, 6, 7)>, <4, (1, 7, 4)>, <5, (2, 6, 5)>, <6, (0, 1, 6)>, <6, (1, 5, 6)>, <6, (3, 5, 6)>, <6, (5, 2, 6)>, <6, (8, 7, 6)>, <6, (9, 6, 6)>, <7, (1, 3, 7)>, <7, (1, 4, 7)>, <7, (3, 1, 7)>, <7, (4, 1, 7)>, <7, (6, 8, 7)>, <8, (6, 7, 8)>, <9, (6, 6, 9)>]
There are 22 unique 3-star structures in this graph. Thus, the answer is [22].
