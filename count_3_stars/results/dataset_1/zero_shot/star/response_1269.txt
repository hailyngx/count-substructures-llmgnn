Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be computed by examining each node and its connections. A 3-star is formed around a central node when that node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Here, we have 10 nodes in the graph:

Node 0: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 5) => <0, (1, 2, 4)>, <0, (1, 2, 5)>
Node 1: (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 8), (1, 9) => <1, (0, 2, 3)>
Node 2: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4) => <2, (0, 1, 4)>
Node 3: (3, 1), (3, 9)
Node 4: (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 8) => <4, (0, 2, 5)>, <4, (0, 5, 6)>
Node 5: (5, 0), (5, 4), (5, 9) => <5, (0, 4, 9)>
Node 6: (6, 4), (6, 7), (6, 9) => <6, (4, 7, 9)>
Node 7: (7, 6)
Node 8: (8, 1), (8, 4)
Node 9: (9, 1), (9, 3), (9, 5), (9, 6) => <9, (1, 3, 6)>, <9, (5, 6, 1)>
  
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
