Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 3 3-stars in the given graph. 
   
   The unique 3-stars are: 
   <0, (3, 8, 1)>
   <2, (3, 0, 8)>
   <5, (1, 3, 6)>
   
   Therefore, the answer is [3].
