Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is 6. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 3, 7)>
<2, (0, 5, 6)>
<3, (0, 5, 8)>
<5, (2, 3, 6)>
<6, (2, 5, 9)>
<9, (4, 5, 6)>

Therefore, the final answer is [6].
