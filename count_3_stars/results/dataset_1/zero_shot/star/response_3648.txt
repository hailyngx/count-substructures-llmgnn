Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<1, (4, 6, 8)>
<2, (1, 3, 7)>
<4, (1, 6, 8)>
