Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The answer is [4].
   <0, (4, 7, 1)>, <2, (1, 5, 9)>, <3, (4, 8, 9)>, <6, (7, 8, 9)>
