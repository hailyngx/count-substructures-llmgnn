Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<2, (0, 6, 8)>
<4, (0, 6, 8)>
<6, (2, 4, 8)>
<8, (0, 2, 4)>
<5, (3, 7, 9)>
<7, (1, 2, 3)>
