Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are a total of 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are:

<0, (2, 6, 9)>
<1, (3, 4, 5)>
<2, (0, 5, 9)>
<5, (1, 2, 9)>

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
