Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-star configurations:
1. <0, (1, 6, 9)>
2. <1, (0, 7, 9)>
3. <5, (4, 6, 9)>
4. <6, (0, 3, 5)>
5. <7, (1, 6, 9)>
6. <9, (0, 7, 8)>
7. <9, (5, 7, 8)>

Therefore, there are a total of [7] 3-stars in the graph.
