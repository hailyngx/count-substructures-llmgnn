Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (2, 0) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) 

Response:
There are [3] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<4, (0, 3, 8)>
<8, (0, 4, 7)>
