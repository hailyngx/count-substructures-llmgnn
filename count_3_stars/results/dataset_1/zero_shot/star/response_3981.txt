Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.

<0, (6, 9, 2)>
<1, (4, 9, 0)>
<2, (6, 7, 0)>
<3, (6, 9, 7)>
