Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:
[<0, (3, 4, 5)>, <1, (2, 6, 7)>, <2, (1, 3, 9)>, <4, (0, 5, 7)>, <5, (3, 4, 7)>, <6, (1, 8, 9)>, <7, (1, 4, 5)>, <9, (2, 4, 6)>]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
