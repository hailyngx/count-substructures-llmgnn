Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 9, 1)>
<1, (3, 7, 9)>
<2, (0, 9, 6)>
<3, (1, 5, 8)>
<5, (3, 6, 9)>
<6, (2, 3, 5)>
