Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The 3-stars are as follows: 

<0, (2, 7, 4)>
<1, (5, 9, 4)>
<2, (0, 4, 5)>
<4, (2, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
