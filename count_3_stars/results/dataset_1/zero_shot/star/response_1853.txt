Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 3, 6)>
<0, (2, 3, 9)>
<0, (3, 4, 6)>
<0, (3, 4, 9)>
<0, (6, 4, 9)>
<1, (7, 4, 9)>
