Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 8) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 4 3-stars in this graph. 
The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 6, 9)>
<1, (4, 5, 9)>
<4, (0, 1, 5)>
<5, (1, 3, 9)>

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
