Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:
- <0, (1, 4, 6)>
- <1, (0, 2, 3)>
- <3, (1, 2, 4)>
- <4, (0, 2, 3)>
- <5, (1, 3, 9)>
- <6, (0, 2, 4)>
- <9, (1, 3, 5)>

Counting all the unique 3-stars mentioned above, we get a total of [7].
