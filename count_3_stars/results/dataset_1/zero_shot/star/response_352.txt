Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
The given graph contains the following 3-stars:

[<0, (2, 7, 1)>, <1, (2, 4, 9)>, <3, (1, 8, 9)>, <4, (1, 5, 6)>]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
