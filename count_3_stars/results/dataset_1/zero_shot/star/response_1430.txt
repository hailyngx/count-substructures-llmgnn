Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) 

Response:
There are [<0, (3, 4, 5)>, <2, (3, 6, 7)>, <4, (0, 8, -)>, <5, (0, -, -)>, <6, (2, 3, 8)>, <7, (0, 2, 3)>, <8, (4, 6, -)>]. Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
