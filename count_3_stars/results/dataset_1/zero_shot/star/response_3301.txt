Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].  
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 3, 7)>
<1, (2, 9, 4)>
<2, (0, 1, 4)>
<3, (0, 5, 6)>
<4, (2, 9, 5)>
<5, (3, 6, 8)>
<6, (3, 5, 8)>
<7, (2, 8, 2)>
<8, (2, 5, 6)>
<9, (1, 4, 5)>
