Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 1) (4, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:  
- <0, (1, 9, 5)>
- <1, (0, 3, 6)>
- <5, (7, 9, 0)>
- <6, (1, 4, 7)>
- <7, (5, 6, 9)>
- <8, (1, 9, 0)>
- <9, (0, 5, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
