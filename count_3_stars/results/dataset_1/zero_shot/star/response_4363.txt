Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (6, 9, 1)>
<1, (4, 6, 7)>
<2, (8, 3, 9)>
<3, (4, 8, 2)>
<4, (1, 6, 9)>
<6, (0, 1, 4)>
<7, (5, 1, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 7)>
