Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 4 different 3-stars in the given graph. The unique 3-stars are listed below:

<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<3, (4, 6, 6)>
<7, (0, 2, 8)>
<9, (1, 7, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
