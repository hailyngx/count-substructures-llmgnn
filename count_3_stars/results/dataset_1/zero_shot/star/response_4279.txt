Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be counted by finding all the nodes with exactly three edges connected to them and treating them as the centers of 3-stars. So let's first find all such nodes:

- Node 0 has 4 edges connected to it.
- Node 1 has 3 edges connected to it.
- Node 4 has 4 edges connected to it.
- Node 5 has 2 edges connected to it.
- Node 6 has 2 edges connected to it.
- Node 8 has 2 edges connected to it.
- Node 9 has 3 edges connected to it.

Therefore, the nodes that can act as the centers of 3-stars are: 1, 5, 6, 8. 

Let's list all the unique 3-stars found:

<1, (0, 8, 9)>
<5, (4, 7, 7)>
<6, (2, 7, 7)>
<8, (1, 4, 1)>

Counting all unique 3-stars found, we have a total of [4] 3-stars in the given graph.
