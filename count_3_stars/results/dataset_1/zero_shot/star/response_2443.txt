Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 4, 9)>
<4, (0, 3, 5)>
<4, (0, 5, 6)>
