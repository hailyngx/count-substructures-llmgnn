Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 4 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<1, (2, 3, 5)>
<5, (1, 2, 3)>
<9, (1, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
