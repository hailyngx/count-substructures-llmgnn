Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) 

Response:
The given graph has a total of 10 nodes and 20 edges. To count the number of 3-stars, we need to identify all the star-like structures where one central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Analyzing the edges, we can find the following 3-stars:

1. <1, (4, 8, 5)>
2. <2, (5, 7, 1)>
3. <3, (5, 6, 7)>
4. <4, (1, 6, 8)>
5. <6, (4, 7, 8)>
6. <7, (2, 6, 8)>
7. <8, (1, 4, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [7].
