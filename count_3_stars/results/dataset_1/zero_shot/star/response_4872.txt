Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are <3, (0, 1, 6)>, <6, (3, 8, 9)> 3-stars in the given graph.  
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
