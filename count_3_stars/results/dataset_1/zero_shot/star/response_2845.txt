Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph can be visualized as follows:
    
    0 ------- 2 --- 5     8 --- 9
    |          |     |       |
    |          |     |       |
    |          |     |       |
    3 ------- 1     3       4
             |
             |
             |
             7

Let's now count the number of 3-stars in this graph. 

There are a total of 10 nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

The 3-stars in this graph are:
<0, (2, 3, 5)>
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<2, (3, 5, 8)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<3, (4, 5, 8)>
<4, (3, 5, 7)>
<5, (2, 3, 8)>
<5, (4, 8, 9)>
<8, (2, 3, 5)>
<8, (4, 5, 9)>
<9, (4, 5, 8)>

Counting all the unique 3-stars we found, we have a total of [10] 3-stars.
