Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in this graph. The count is inside brackets [].

<0, (1, 2, 6)>
<1, (3, 0, 9)>
<3, (1, 4, 5)>
<4, (3, 6, 8)> 

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
