Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 3 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The count of 3-stars is [3].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 9, 0)>
<3, (0, 4, 9)>
<4, (1, 2, 3)>
