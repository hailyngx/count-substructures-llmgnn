Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 8) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars:
<1, (8, 2, 9)>
<2, (0, 5, 8)>
<4, (3, 8, 9)>
<8, (1, 2, 4)>
