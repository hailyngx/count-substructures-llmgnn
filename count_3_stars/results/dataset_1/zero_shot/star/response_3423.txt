Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in this graph can be calculated by counting the number of 3-stars centered at each node. 

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: 3-stars: <0, (2, 3, 9)>
- Node 1: 3-stars: <1, (5)>
- Node 2: 3-stars: <2, (0, 8, 9)>
- Node 3: 3-stars: <3, (0, 5, 9)>
- Node 4: 3-stars: <4, (6)>
- Node 5: 3-stars: <5, (1, 3, 6)>
- Node 6: 3-stars: <6, (4, 5, 9)>
- Node 7: 3-stars: <7, (9)>
- Node 8: 3-stars: <8, (2, 5)>
- Node 9: 3-stars: <9, (0, 2, 3)> <9, (6, 7)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars: 10 3-stars in total.

Therefore, the final answer is [10].
