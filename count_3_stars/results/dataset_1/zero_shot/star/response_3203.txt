Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<2, (3, 4, 6)>
<2, (3, 8, 9)>
<4, (2, 7, 8)>
