Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in this graph is [12].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 6, 9)>
<1, (4, 5, 6)>
<2, (0, 5, 8)>
<3, (2, 5, 9)>
<4, (1, 5, 6)>
<5, (1, 2, 3)>
<6, (0, 1, 4)>
<7, (9)>
<8, (1, 2, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 4)>
<9, (7)>
<9, (4, 5, 7)>
