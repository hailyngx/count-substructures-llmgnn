Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (2, 5, 7)>
<2, (1, 5, 8)>
<5, (1, 2, 3)>
<7, (1, 5, 8)>
