Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph contains the following 3-stars:
[<0, (6, 9, 4)>, <1, (2, 4, 7)>, <2, (1, 4, 8)>, <4, (1, 3, 6)>, <6, (0, 4, 7)>, <7, (2, 5, 9)>]
Count of 3-stars: [6]
