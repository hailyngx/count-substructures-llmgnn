Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The unique 3-stars are:

<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<1, (2, 3, 6)>
<1, (2, 7, 8)>
<1, (3, 5, 8)>
<4, (0, 3, 9)>
<7, (0, 1, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
