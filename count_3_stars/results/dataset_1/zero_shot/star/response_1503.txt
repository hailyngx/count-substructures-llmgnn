Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are listed inside <>:
   - <0, (3, 7, 8)>
   - <1, (3, 4, 9)>
   - <3, (0, 1, 6)>
   - <9, (1, 5, 6)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
