Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The graph contains the following 3-stars:
1. <0, (1, 3, 8)>
2. <1, (0, 3, 7)>
3. <3, (0, 1, 8)>
4. <7, (1, 4, 5)>
5. <8, (0, 3, 5)>
6. <4, (5, 7, -)>
7. <2, (6, 7, -)>
8. <5, (4, 7, 8)>
9. <6, (2, 7, 8)>
10. <9, (7, -, -)>

Therefore, there are a total of [10] 3-stars in the graph.
