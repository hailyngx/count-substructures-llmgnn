Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].  

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 6, 8)>
<0, (1, 8, 9)>
<3, (1, 6, 9)>
<4, (2, 5, 6)>
<5, (2, 5, 7)>
<6, (4, 5, 7)>
