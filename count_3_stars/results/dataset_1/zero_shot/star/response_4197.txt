Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) 

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are:
<0, (2, 3, 8)>
<1, (2, 5, 7)>
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<2, (4, 6, 8)>
<4, (5, 6, 8)>
<5, (1, 4, 8)>
<6, (2, 4, 7)>
<8, (0, 4, 5)>

Count of 3-stars: [8]
