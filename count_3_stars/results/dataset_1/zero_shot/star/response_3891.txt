Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 3 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The 3-stars are as follows:
<0, (2, 4, 8)>
<1, (3, 4, 6)>
<2, (0, 3, 7)>
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
