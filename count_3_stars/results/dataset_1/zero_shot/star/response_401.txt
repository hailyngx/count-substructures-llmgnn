Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are two 3-stars in the given graph. The unique 3-stars are <0, (3, 8, 9)> and <4, (1, 7, 9)>. Therefore, the answer is [2].
