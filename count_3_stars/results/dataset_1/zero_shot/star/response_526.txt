Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (6, 7, 1)>
