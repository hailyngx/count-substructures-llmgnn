Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are along with their central node and leaves:

1. <0, (2, 4, 5)>
2. <1, (4, 6, 9)>
3. <3, (4, 5, 6)>
4. <9, (1, 2, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
