Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph.

<0, (2, 5, 6)>
<0, (2, 6, 8)>
<0, (5, 6, 8)>
<2, (0, 1, 4)>
<2, (0, 4, 5)>
<2, (1, 7, 8)>
