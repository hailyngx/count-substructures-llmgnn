Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-star structures:
[<0, (1, 3, 4)>, <2, (6, 7, 8)>]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
