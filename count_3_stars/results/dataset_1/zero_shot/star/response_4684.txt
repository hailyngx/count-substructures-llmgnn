Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be found by following these steps:

First, identify the nodes with degree 3 since they can act as the center of a 3-star. In this graph, nodes 2, 3, 4, and 8 have a degree of 3.

Next, for each node with degree 3, count the number of unique 3-stars that can be formed. 

For node 2:
- <2, (0, 3, 4)>
- <2, (0, 4, 8)>

For node 3:
- <3, (1, 2, 8)>

For node 4:
- <4, (0, 2, 8)>
- <4, (0, 6, 8)>

For node 8:
- <8, (2, 3, 4)>
- <8, (5, 6, 9)>

There are a total of 7 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the final answer is [7].
