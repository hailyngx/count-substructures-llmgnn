Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<2, (1, 5, 6)>
<6, (3, 4, 9)>
