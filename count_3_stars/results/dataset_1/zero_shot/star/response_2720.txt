Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the graph can be determined by finding the number of nodes that can act as the center of a 3-star. Each node that has exactly three neighboring nodes forms a 3-star.

In this graph, the nodes and their connections are as follows:
- Node 0 has 3 neighboring nodes: 1, 3, 9
- Node 1 has 3 neighboring nodes: 0, 3, 4
- Node 2 has 3 neighboring nodes: 4, 5, 6
- Node 3 has 3 neighboring nodes: 0, 1, 6
- Node 4 has 3 neighboring nodes: 1, 2, 6
- Node 5 has 2 neighboring nodes: 2, 9
- Node 6 has 3 neighboring nodes: 2, 3, 4
- Node 7 has 3 neighboring nodes: 3, 8, 9
- Node 8 has 1 neighboring node: 7
- Node 9 has 3 neighboring nodes: 0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 7

Therefore, the central nodes of the 3-stars in the graph are nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, and 9. Each of these nodes can form a 3-star. 

The unique 3-stars are as follows:
<0, (1, 3, 9)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<3, (0, 1, 6)>
<4, (1, 2, 6)>
<6, (2, 3, 4)>
<9, (0, 1, 3)>
 
Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
