Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-star structures:
[<1, (2, 5, 7)>, <1, (7, 8, 9)>, <2, (1, 7, 9)>, <4, (6, 7, 8)>]

Therefore, there are a total of [4] 3-stars in the given graph.
