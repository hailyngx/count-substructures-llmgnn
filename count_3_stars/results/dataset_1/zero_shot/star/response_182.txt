Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 5 3-stars in the given graph. Here are the unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 6, 3)>
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<1, (8, 3, 9)>
<4, (6, 7, 8)>
<4, (9, 5, 6)>


Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
