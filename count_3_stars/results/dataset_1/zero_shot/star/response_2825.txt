Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph. The unique 3-stars found are:

<0, (1, 8, 4)>
<1, (0, 3, 8)>
<3, (1, 4, 6)>
<4, (3, 7, 8)>
