Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be found by counting the number of unique 3-stars that can be formed. 

To form a 3-star, we need to identify the central node (the one connected to exactly three other nodes). From the given list of edges, we can observe that the central node will be connected to three other nodes. 

Given the edges, we can identify the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<2, (0, 4, 4)>
<3, (1, 8, 9)>
<4, (0, 1, 2)>
<5, (7, 7, 7)>
<6, (9, 9, 9)>
<7, (0, 4, 5)>
<8, (3, 8, 9)>
<9, (1, 4, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
