Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Below are the 3-stars listed inside <> brackets:

<0, (1, 2, 8)>
<1, (0, 2, 6)>
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<3, (2, 6, 9)>
<6, (1, 3, 4)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
