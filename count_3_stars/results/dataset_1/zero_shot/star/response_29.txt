Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<1, (3, 6, 8)>
<2, (0, 3, 7)>
<3, (1, 2, 9)>
<4, (0, 8, 5)>
<6, (0, 1, 7)>
<7, (1, 2, -)>
<8, (1, 3, 4)>
