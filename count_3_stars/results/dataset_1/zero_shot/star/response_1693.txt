Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
There are 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The 3-stars are as follows:

<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<1, (4, 7, 8)>
<3, (0, 5, 6)>
<4, (0, 1, 8)>
<5, (0, 3, 8)>

So the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
