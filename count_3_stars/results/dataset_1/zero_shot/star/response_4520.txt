Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph. 
The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (1, 5, 9)>
<1, (0, 2, 6)>
<5, (0, 1, 4)>
<9, (0, 1, 8)>
