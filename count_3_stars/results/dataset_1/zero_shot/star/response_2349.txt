Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 6) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
The 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 7, 9)>
<1, (0, 6, 6)>
<7, (0, 8, 8)>
<9, (0, 3, 3)>

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
