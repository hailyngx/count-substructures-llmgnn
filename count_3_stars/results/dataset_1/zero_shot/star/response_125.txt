Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (4, 5, 8)>
<5, (0, 2, 7)>
<6, (3, 7, 9)>
<7, (3, 5, 6)>
