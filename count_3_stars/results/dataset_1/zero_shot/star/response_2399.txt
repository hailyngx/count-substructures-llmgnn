Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are 2 3-stars in the given graph.  
The unique 3-stars are:  
<0, (7, 9, 2)>  
<3, (1, 4, 6)>  

Therefore, the final answer is [2].
