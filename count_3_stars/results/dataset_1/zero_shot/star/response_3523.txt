Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 8 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
The 3-stars are as follows: 
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<1, (0, 4, 6)>
<2, (0, 3, 6)>
<3, (0, 1, 5)>
<4, (1, 7, 8)>
<5, (3, 7, 8)>
<6, (1, 2, 7)>
<7, (1, 3, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
