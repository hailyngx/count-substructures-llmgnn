Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 3-stars in the given graph with the following unique configurations:

<0, (4, 5, 8)>
<1, (2, 6, 6)>
<2, (1, 5, 5)>
<5, (0, 2, 3)>
<6, (1, 7, 9)>
<9, (5, 6, 5)>

Therefore, there are a total of [6] 3-stars in the graph.
