Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph contains the following 3-stars:

[<0, (2, 5, 6)>, <1, (5, 2, 9)>, <2, (4, 7, 9)>, <3, (5, 4, 8)>, <4, (2, 7, 8)>, <5, (1, 2, 3)>, <6, (0, 5, 6)>, <7, (2, 4, 8)>, <8, (3, 4, 9)>, <9, (1, 2, 8)>]

Therefore, there are 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The final answer is [10].
