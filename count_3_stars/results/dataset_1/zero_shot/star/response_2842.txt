Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph:
    
    - <0, (2, 3, 4)>
    - <0, (2, 4, 6)>
    - <0, (2, 6, 7)>
    - <6, (4, 5, 7)>
    
    Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
