Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.  

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (8, 9, 5)>
<2, (1, 3, 9)>
<4, (1, 3, 7)>
<6, (1, 3, 5)>
