Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of [10] nodes in the given graph.
The number of edges in the graph is [32].

The 3-star graphs in the given graph can be represented as follows:
<0, (3, 4, 8)>
<1, (3, 6, 8)>
<2, (3, 4, _)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<4, (0, 2, 6)>
<6, (1, 4, 9)>
<8, (0, 1, 5)>
<9, (3, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
