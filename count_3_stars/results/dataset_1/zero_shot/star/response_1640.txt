Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4].  

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<1, (0, 3, 6)>
<2, (3, 5, 7)>
<5, (0, 2, 6)>
