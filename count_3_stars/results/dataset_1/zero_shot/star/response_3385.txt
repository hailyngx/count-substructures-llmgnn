Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) 

Response:
The graph has the following 3-stars:
[<0, (5, 6, 2)>, <2, (0, 6, 5)>, <3, (5, 8, 6)>]
