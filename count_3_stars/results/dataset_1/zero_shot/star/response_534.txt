Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
The center of the 3-stars in this graph can only be node 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, or 9 since those are the only nodes connected to exactly three other nodes.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:

1. Central node 0: <0, (1, 2, 4)>, <0, (1, 6, 7)>
2. Central node 1: <1, (0, 2, 4)>, <1, (0, 6, 9)>
3. Central node 2: <2, (0, 1, 6)>
4. Central node 4: <4, (0, 1, 5)>
5. Central node 6: <6, (0, 1, 2)>, <6, (0, 5, 8)>
6. Central node 7: <7, (0, 5, 8)>
7. Central node 8: <8, (6, 9, 7)>
8. Central node 9: <9, (1, 6, 8)>

So, there are a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
