Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 3-stars in this graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:

<0, (2, 5, 1)>
<1, (2, 8, 9)>
<2, (0, 1, 8)>
<3, (2, 5, 6)>
<4, (6, 7, 3)>
<5, (0, 3, 2)>
<6, (3, 4, 7)>
<7, (6, 4, 3)>
<8, (1, 2, 9)>
<9, (1, 8, 2)>

So, there are [9] 3-stars in this graph.
