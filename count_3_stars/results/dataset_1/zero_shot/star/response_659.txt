Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].  

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<1, (8, 9, )>
<2, (0, 3, )>
<4, (0, 5, 7)>
