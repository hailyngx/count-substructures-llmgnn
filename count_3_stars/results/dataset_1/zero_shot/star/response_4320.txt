Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-star structures:

[<0, (3, 4, 5)>, <2, (6, 8, 9)>, <3, (0, 4, 5)>, <4, (0, 1, 3)>, <5, (0, 3, 6)>, <8, (2, 5, 9)>]

Therefore, there are a total of [6] 3-stars in the graph.
