Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 9) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

```
0 -- 1 -- 2 -- 8
|         |  
9         4 -- 5
          |  
          3 -- 6 -- 9
```

The 3-star graphs in this graph are as follows:
- <0, (1, 9, 4)>
- <1, (0, 2, 4)>
- <2, (1, 4, 8)>
- <4, (1, 2, 5)>
- <5, (4, 9, 6)>
- <6, (3, 9, 5)>
- <9, (0, 5, 6)>

There are a total of 7 unique 3-star subgraphs in the given graph. Therefore, the final answer is [7].
