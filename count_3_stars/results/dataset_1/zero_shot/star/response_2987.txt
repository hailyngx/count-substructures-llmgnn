Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are three 3-stars in the given graph.

The 3-stars are:
<2, (3, 6, 7)>
<4, (8, 6, 9)>
<6, (2, 3, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
