Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The count is [6].
   
   <0, (3, 5, 6)>
   <1, (2, 4, 7)>
   <2, (1, 7, 8)>
   <3, (0, 6, 8)>
   <6, (1, 3, 5)>
   <8, (2, 4, 9)>
