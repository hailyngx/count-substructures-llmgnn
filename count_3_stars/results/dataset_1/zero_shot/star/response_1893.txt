Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) 

Response:
There are 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

The 3-stars are:
<1, (3, 5, 6)>
<4, (0, 3, 8)>

Therefore, the final answer is [2].
