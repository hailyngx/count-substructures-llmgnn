Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are:

<1, (5, 6, 7)>
<1, (3, 7, 9)>
<3, (1, 2, 9)>
<4, (5, 7, 9)>
<5, (0, 1, 3)>
<9, (1, 3, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
