Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be calculated by counting the number of 3-stars that can be formed.

Let's analyze the connections for each node in the graph:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 6, and 7.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, and 7.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 6.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 6, and 7.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 5.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 5, and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1 and 7.
- Node 9 is connected to node 4.

From the connections, we can see that there are multiple 3-stars present in the graph. These can be listed as follows:
<0, (2, 6, 7)>
<1, (4, 5, 8)>
<2, (0, 4, 7)>
<3, (5, 6, 7)>
<4, (1, 2, 9)>
<5, (1, 3, 7)>
<6, (0, 3, 5)>
<7, (0, 2, 5)>
<8, (1, 7, -)>
<9, (4, -, -)>

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
