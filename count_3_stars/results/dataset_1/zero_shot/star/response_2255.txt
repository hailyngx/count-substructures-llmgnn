Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 4) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars are:
<2, (3, 5, 6)>
<2, (4, 5, 9)>
<4, (5, 6, 8)>
<4, (8, 6, 9)>
<5, (2, 4, 6)>
<8, (4, 6, 9)>
