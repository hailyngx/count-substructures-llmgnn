Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Below are the 3-stars found:

<0, (4, 6, 8)>
<1, (2, 5, 9)>
<3, (4, 6, 8)>
<9, (1, 2, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
