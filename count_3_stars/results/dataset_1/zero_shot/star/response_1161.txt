Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:
- <0, (1, 6, 5)>
- <2, (4, 5, 3)>
- <3, (1, 4, 5)>
- <4, (2, 3, 5)>
- <5, (2, 3, 6)>
- <6, (0, 1, 5)>
  
Therefore, there are a total of [6] 3-stars in the graph.
