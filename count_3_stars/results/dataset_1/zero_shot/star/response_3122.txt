Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The count of 3-stars is [6].

<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<2, (1, 3, 7)>
<3, (1, 2, 9)>
<6, (0, 1, 4)>
<7, (2, 4, 9)>
