Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of [8] 3-star configurations in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<1, (4, 7, 9)>
<2, (0, 5, 6)>
<3, (5, 6, 7)>
<4, (0, 1, 6)>
<6, (0, 2, 4)>
<7, (2, 3, 4)>
<9, (2, 4, 7)>
