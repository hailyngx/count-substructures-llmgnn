Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
In the given graph, there are three 3-stars:
1. <0, (1, 4, 9)>
2. <1, (0, 6, -)>
3. <6, (1, 4, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
