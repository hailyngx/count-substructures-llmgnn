Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph.  

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<1, (0, 2, 9)>
<2, (1, 5, -)>
<3, (8, 9, -)>
<4, (0, 6, -)>
<6, (0, 4, 7)>
