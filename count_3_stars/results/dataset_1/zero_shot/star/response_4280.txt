Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. To count the number of 3-stars, we need to identify sets of nodes where one node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Upon examining the list of edges provided, we find the following 3-star structures:
1. <0, (3, 4, 2)>
2. <2, (3, 4, 8)>
3. <3, (0, 2, 6)>
4. <4, (0, 2, 7)>
5. <6, (3, 5, 7)>
6. <7, (1, 4, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
