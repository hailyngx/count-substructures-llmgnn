Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (5, 7, 9)>
<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<1, (4, 6, 9)>
<1, (6, 7, 8)>
<1, (6, 8, 9)>
<2, (1, 7, 9)>
