Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 4) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph, which can be represented as:

<1, (2, 5, 8)>
<4, (3, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
