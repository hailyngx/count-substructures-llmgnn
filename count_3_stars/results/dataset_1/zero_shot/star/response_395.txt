Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph:
[<0, (1, 8, 9)>, <1, (0, 2, 3)>, <3, (1, 4, 6)>, <7, (1, 2, 9)>]
