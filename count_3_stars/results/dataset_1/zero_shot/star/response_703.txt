Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are as follows:
<0, (1, 3, 9)>
<1, (0, 3, 6)>
<2, (5, 6, 9)>
<3, (0, 1, 6)>
<5, (2, 7, 9)>
<6, (1, 2, 3)>
<9, (0, 2, 3)>

Thus, there are [7] 3-stars in the given graph.
