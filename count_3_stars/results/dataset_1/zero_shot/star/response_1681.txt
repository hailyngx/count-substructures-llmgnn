Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in this graph is [8].  

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 8, 9)>
<1, (6, 9, 4)>
<2, (0, 8, 9)>
<3, (5, 9, 4)>
<4, (6, 9, 5)>
<5, (3, 9, 6)>
<6, (1, 9, 4)>
<9, (5, 4, 3)>
