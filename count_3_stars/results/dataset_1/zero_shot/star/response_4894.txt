Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in this graph. Therefore, the final answer is [6].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 5, 7)>
<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<2, (1, 4, 5)>
<4, (1, 2, 5)>
<5, (0, 2, 4)>
<7, (0, 4, 8)>
