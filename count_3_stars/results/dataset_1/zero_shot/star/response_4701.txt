Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 3-star subgraphs in the given graph are:  
<0, (4, 6, 7)>  
<3, (5, 6, 7)>  
<6, (0, 1, 3)>  
<8, (0, 2, 3)>  
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
