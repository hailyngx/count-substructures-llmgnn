Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 2) (8, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 8, -)>
<2, (3, 7, -)>
<4, (5, 6, 9)>
<5, (4, 6, 9)>
