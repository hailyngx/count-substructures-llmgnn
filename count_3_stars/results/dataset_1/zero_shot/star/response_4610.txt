Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].

    <0, (3, 6, 8)>
    <1, (2, 7, 4)>
    <2, (1, 3, 5)>
    <3, (0, 2, 5)>
    <3, (0, 6, 8)>
    <3, (2, 5, 7)>
    <3, (5, 6, 9)>
    <3, (7, 4, 9)>
