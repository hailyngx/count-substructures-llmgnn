Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:

[6]

<0, (7, 8, 9)>
<1, (3, 4, 5)>
<2, (3, 4, 6)>
<3, (1, 2, 4)>
<4, (1, 2, 3)>
<5, (1, 5, 6)>
<7, (0, 5, 9)>
<8, (0, 1, 9)>

Therefore, there are a total of [8] 3-stars in the graph.
