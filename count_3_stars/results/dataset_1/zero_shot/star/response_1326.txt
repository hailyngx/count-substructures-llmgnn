Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:
    1. <0, (3, 5, 6)>
    2. <1, (2, 4, 7)>
    3. <1, (4, 7, 8)>
    4. <2, (1, 4, 7)>
    5. <4, (1, 6, 8)>
    6. <4, (6, 8, 9)>

Counting the unique 3-stars gives us a total of [6].
