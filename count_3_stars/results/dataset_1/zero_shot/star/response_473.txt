Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 2, 8)>
<1, (0, 4, 5)>
<2, (0, 7, 9)>
<4, (1, 5, 6)>
<5, (1, 4, 8)>
<8, (0, 3, 5)>
