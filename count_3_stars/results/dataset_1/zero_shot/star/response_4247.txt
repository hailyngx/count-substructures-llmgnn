Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 3) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph.  

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (6, 8, 0)>
<1, (6, 1, 7)>
<1, (5, 1, 3)>
<2, (7, 9, 2)>
<3, (1, 4, 3)>
<7, (2, 9, 7)>
