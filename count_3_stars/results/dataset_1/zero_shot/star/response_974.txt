Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 9) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are four 3-stars in the given graph. 
Therefore, the final answer is [4].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 7, 9)>
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<3, (1, 6, 9)>
<9, (1, 4, 7)>
