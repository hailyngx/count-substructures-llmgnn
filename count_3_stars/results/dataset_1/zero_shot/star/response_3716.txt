Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-star structures:

[<0, (7, 8, 9)>, <2, (4, 8, 9)>, <4, (2, 8, 9)>, <5, (6, 7, 8)>, <6, (5, 7, 8)>]

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
