Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The graph has the following 3-stars:
    1. <0, (1, 5, 8)>
    2. <1, (0, 2, 6)>
    3. <2, (1, 3, 8)>
    4. <3, (2, 4, 6)>
    5. <4, (3, 7, 9)>
    6. <5, (0, 7, 8)>
    7. <6, (1, 3, 7)>
    8. <7, (3, 5, 9)>
    9. <8, (0, 1, 2)>
    10. <9, (0, 7, 8)>

Therefore, there are a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
