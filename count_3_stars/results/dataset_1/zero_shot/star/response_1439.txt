Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The 3-stars in this graph can be identified as follows:
<1, (6, 9, _)>  
<2, (5, 6, _)>  
<4, (5, 6, 7)>  
<4, (6, 7, _)>  
<5, (2, 4, 6)>  
<5, (4, 6, 8)>  
<5, (6, 8, _)>  
<9, (1, 4, 5)>  
<9, (4, 5, _)>

Therefore, there are a total of [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
