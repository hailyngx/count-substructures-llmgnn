Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 10 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (2, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 2 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (8, 4, 9)>
<4, (8, 0, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
