Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [2] 3-stars in the given graph.
  
The 3-stars present in the graph are:
<0, (5, 9, 8)>
<2, (7, 8, 3)>.
