Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (3, 4, 7)>
<1, (2, 6, 8)>
<2, (1, 9, 5)>
<3, (0, 4, 5)>
<4, (5, 6, 8)>
<5, (7, 8, 9)>
