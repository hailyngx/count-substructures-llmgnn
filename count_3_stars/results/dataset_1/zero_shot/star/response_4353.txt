Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 6, 7, and 8.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 8 and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 6, 7, and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 2 and 5.
- Node 4 is connected to node 5.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 6, 8, and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, and 5.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 5, and 7.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 5.

To count the number of 3-stars (or triangles with one additional leaf), we simply need to identify the number of central nodes (nodes with exactly 3 neighbors) in the graph.

The central nodes in this graph are:
- Node 0 (connections: 2, 6, 7, and 8)
- Node 5 (connections: 3, 4, 6, 8, and 9)
- Node 8 (connections: 0, 1, 5, and 7)

There are 3 unique 3-stars in this graph:
1. <0, (2, 6, 7)>
2. <0, (6, 7, 8)>
3. <5, (3, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
