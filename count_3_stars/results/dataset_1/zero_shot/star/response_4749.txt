Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
The 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 8, 9)>
<3, (1, 4, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
