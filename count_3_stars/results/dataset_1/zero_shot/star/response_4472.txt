Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) 

Response:
Counting the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

There are 3-stars centered at nodes 0, 1, and 2. Thus, the possible 3-stars in the graph are:
<0, (5, 7, 2)>, <1, (3, 6, 2)>, <2, (5, 6, 8)>.

There are a total of [3] 3-stars in the graph.
