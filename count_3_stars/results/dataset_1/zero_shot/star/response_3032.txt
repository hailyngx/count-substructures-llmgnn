Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 5) 

Response:
The given graph contains 6 unique 3-stars. Here are the 3-stars found:
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<3, (4, 5, 7)>
<5, (0, 1, 7)>
<5, (8, 7, 9)>
<8, (5, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
