Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (4, 6, 7)>
<1, (5, 9, 7)>
<2, (8, 5, 9)>
<4, (0, 7, 5)>
<5, (1, 6, 9)>
<6, (0, 5, 7)>
<7, (0, 4, 5)>
<8, (2, 5, 9)>
