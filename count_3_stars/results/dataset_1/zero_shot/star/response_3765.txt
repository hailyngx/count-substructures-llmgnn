Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 3-stars in the given graph. The unique 3-stars are:

<0, (5, 7, 2)>
<4, (1, 8, 5)>
<5, (0, 2, 6)>
<7, (0, 2, 9)>

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
