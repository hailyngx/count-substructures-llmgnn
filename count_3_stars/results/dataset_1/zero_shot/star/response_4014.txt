Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (5, 6, 7)>
<2, (3, 4, 6)>
<6, (0, 3, 9)>
<7, (1, 5, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
