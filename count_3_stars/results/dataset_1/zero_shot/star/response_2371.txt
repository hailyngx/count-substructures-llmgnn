Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph. 
The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 5, 7)>
<1, (4, 7, 9)>
<2, (4, 5, 6)>
<2, (5, 7, 9)>
