Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (3, 5) (3, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 7, 0)>
<1, (0, 5, 6)>
<3, (5, 9, 3)>
<5, (1, 8, 9)>
<6, (1, 9, 6)>
<9, (3, 5, 6)>
