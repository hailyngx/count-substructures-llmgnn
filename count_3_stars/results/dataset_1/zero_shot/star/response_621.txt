Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 8, 9)>
<1, (2, 3, 5)>
<3, (1, 4, 5)>
<7, (1, 4, 6)>
