Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 6) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph.  
The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 5, 7)>
<1, (2, 6, 7)>
<2, (1, 6, 7)>
<3, (0, 5, 7)>
<5, (0, 3, 7)>
<7, (1, 2, 3)>
