Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are: 

<0, (3, 6, 7)>
<2, (6, 9, 3)>
<3, (0, 7, 9)>
<4, (5, 8, 7)>
<5, (4, 7, 7)>
<6, (0, 2, 7)>
<7, (0, 3, 5)>
<8, (4, 7, 7)>
<9, (2, 3, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
