Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 7, 9)>
<1, (0, 2, 6)>
<2, (1, 5, -)>
<3, (5, 9, -)>
<4, (6, 9, -)>
<5, (2, 3, -)>
<6, (1, 4, 9)>
<9, (0, 3, 4)>
