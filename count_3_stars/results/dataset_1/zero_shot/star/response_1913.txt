Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 5, 7)>
<1, (7, 8, 2)>
<4, (5, 6, 7)>
<5, (0, 4, 6)>
<6, (4, 5, ?)>
<7, (0, 1, 2)>
