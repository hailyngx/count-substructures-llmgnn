Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's start by identifying the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (2, 4, 6)>
2. <1, (4, 5, 8)>
3. <2, (0, 4, 5)>
4. <3, (5, 7, 8)>
5. <4, (0, 1, 2)>
6. <5, (1, 2, 3)>
7. <6, (0, 4, 8)>
8. <7, (3, 4, x)> (Note: x can be either 8 or 9, let's investigate further)
9. <8, (1, 2, 3)>
10. <9, (2, 6, x)> (Note: x can be either 6 or 2, let's investigate further)

From the given edges, we can see that the number of 3-stars in this graph is [10].
