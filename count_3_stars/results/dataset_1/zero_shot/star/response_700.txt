Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 5) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 3 unique 3-stars in the given graph, and they are:

<0, (4, 5, 7)>
<4, (0, 3, 6)>
<5, (0, 1, 9)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
