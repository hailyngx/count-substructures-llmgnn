Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The graph described can be visualized as follows:

```
  0 --- 4 --- 6
  |     |  
  |     5
  |      
  5      
  |      
  4 --- 8 --- 9
  |     |
  |     |
  0 --- 2 --- 3 --- 7
```

To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we first identify the central nodes which have exactly three neighbors. Then we check those neighbors to see if they form 3-stars.

From the given graph:
- Node 3 is the only central node with three neighbors: 2, 7, and 8.

Possible 3-stars:
1. <3, (2, 7, 8)>
2. <7, (3, 8, 9)>
3. <8, (2, 3, 4)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
