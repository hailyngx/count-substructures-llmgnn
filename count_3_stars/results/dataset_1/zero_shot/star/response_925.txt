Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 3-star structures in the given graph. Here is the list of unique 3-stars along with their central node and leaf nodes:

<1, (2, 5, 6)>
<3, (4, 5, 6)>
<7, (0, 3, 6)>
<8, (2, 5, 7)> 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
