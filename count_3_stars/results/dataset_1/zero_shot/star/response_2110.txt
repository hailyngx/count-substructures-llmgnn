Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The 3-stars are as follows:
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<2, (4, 8, 9)>
<4, (0, 1, 2)>
<7, (4, 9, 7)>

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
