Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
The given graph has a total of 10 nodes and 34 edges. To find the 3-stars in the graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. We can identify these 3-stars based on the definition provided.

Let's list the 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (2, 7, 9)>
<1, (2, 5, 6)>
<2, (0, 1, 5)>
<3, (2, 4, 6)>
<4, (3, 5, 7)>
<5, (1, 2, 4)>
<6, (1, 2, 7)>
<7, (0, 4, 5)>
<8, (5)>
<9, (0, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
