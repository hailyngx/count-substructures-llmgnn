Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:
[<0, (1, 5, 8)><1, (0, 6, 7)><3, (2, 5, 7)><6, (1, 4, 7)><8, (0, 3, 9)>]  

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
