Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 3 different 3-stars in the given graph. 

The 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 4, 7)>
<1, (2, 4, 0)>
<2, (0, 1, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [3].
