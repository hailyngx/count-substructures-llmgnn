Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 4, 9)>
<1, (4, 7, 7)>
<2, (4, 6, 9)>
<3, (6, 9, 9)>
<7, (1, 4, 7)>
