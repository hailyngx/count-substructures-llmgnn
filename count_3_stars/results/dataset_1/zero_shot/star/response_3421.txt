Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be calculated by counting all the nodes that are adjacent to exactly three other nodes. Let's first identify the unique 3-stars present in the graph:

<2, (4, 6, 8)>
<4, (2, 5, 8)>

From the unique 3-stars identified, it can be seen that there are 2 distinct 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
