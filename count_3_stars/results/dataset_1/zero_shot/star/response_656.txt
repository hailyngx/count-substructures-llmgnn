Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are [2] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<2, (0, 1, 9)>
