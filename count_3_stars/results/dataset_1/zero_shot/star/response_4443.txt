Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) 

Response:
There are a total of [4] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (6, 7, 3)>
<1, (2, 3, 8)>
<2, (1, 4, 5)>
<7, (0, 5, 8)>
