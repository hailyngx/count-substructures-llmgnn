Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are a total of [3] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 4, 7)>
<5, (2, 4, 7)>
<8, (6, 7, 9)>
