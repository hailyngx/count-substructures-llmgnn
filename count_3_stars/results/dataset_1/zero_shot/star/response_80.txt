Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 7 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The answer is [7].
    
The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<1, (0, 2, 0)>
<2, (0, 1, 5)>
<3, (7, 8, 4)>
<4, (7, 8, 9)>
<5, (2, 7, 6)>
<6, (2, 7, 8)>
