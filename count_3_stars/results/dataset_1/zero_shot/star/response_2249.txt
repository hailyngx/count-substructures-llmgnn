Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph contains 4 unique 3-stars. 
The 3-stars are: 
<0, (4, 6, 8)>
<3, (1, 4, 9)>
<5, (8, 9, 7)>
<9, (0, 3, 5)>

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
