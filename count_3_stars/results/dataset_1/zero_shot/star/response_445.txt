Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in this graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (3, 4, 8)>
<1, (3, 9, 5)>
<2, (5, 8, 6)>
<3, (0, 1, 5)>
<5, (2, 3, 9)>
<9, (1, 5, 7)>
