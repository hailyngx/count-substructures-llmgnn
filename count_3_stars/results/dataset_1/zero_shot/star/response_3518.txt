Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-star structures:
- <0, (4, 5, 1)>
- <1, (4, 0, 2)>
- <2, (4, 5, 6)>
- <4, (0, 1, 2)>
- <5, (0, 2, 9)>
- <6, (4, 2, 7)>
- <7, (2, 6, 8)>
- <8, (4, 6, 3)>
- <9, (2, 5, 0)>
  
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
