Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are [10] unique 3-stars in this graph. 

The 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<1, (0, 3, 6)>
<1, (2, 6, 8)>
<3, (0, 1, 8)>
<4, (0, 8, 6)>
<6, (0, 1, 2)>
<7, (0, 1, 5)>
<8, (2, 3, 4)>
