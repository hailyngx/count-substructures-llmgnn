Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Below are the details of each 3-star along with their central node and leaf nodes:

1. <0, (2, 3, 4)>
2. <1, (4, 5, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
