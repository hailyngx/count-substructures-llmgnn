Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph contains the following 3-stars:
[<0, (2, 3, 4)>, <1, (2, 4, 9)>, <2, (0, 1, 4)>, <4, (0, 1, 2)>] 

There are 4 unique 3-stars in this graph. Therefore, the final answer is [4].
