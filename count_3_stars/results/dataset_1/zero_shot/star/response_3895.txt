Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph. 
The unique 3-stars are <0, (2, 4, 6)>, <0, (4, 7, 9)>, <2, (0, 4, 6)>, <4, (0, 2, 7)>, <4, (1, 8, 9)>, and <9, (6, 7, 4)>.
