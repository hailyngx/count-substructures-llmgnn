Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 5, and 6.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 4 and 7.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 6.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 2 and 4.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, 6, 7, and 8.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 6, and 7.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 5, 6, and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 7.

To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to find each occurrence of a central node with exactly three leaves. 

The 3-stars in this graph are:
1. <0, (2, 4, 5)>
2. <2, (0, 3, 6)>
3. <4, (0, 3, 6)>
4. <6, (0, 2, 5)>
5. <7, (1, 5, 8)>
6. <8, (4, 6, 7)>

Therefore, there are a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
