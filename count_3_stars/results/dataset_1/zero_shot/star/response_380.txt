Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are as follows:
[<0, (5, 8, 6)>, <3, (2, 4, 6)>]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
