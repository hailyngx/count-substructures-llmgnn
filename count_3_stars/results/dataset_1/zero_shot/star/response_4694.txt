Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
The total number of 3-star configurations in the given graph can be found by looking at every node that has exactly 3 neighbors. Let's identify all the 3-stars present in the graph:

1. <0, (2, 7, 8)>
2. <0, (2, 7, 9)>
3. <1, (3, 7, 9)>
4. <2, (0, 7, 8)>
5. <3, (1, 4, 6)>
6. <4, (3, 8, 9)>
7. <6, (3, 5, 7)>
8. <7, (0, 1, 2)>
9. <8, (0, 4, 6)>
10. <9, (0, 1, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
