Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be found by counting the number of nodes that can act as the central node in a 3-star. Here, we can see that nodes 0, 1, 2, 5, and 6 can each act as the center of their own unique 3-star. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 5.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 5, 7)>
<1, (2, 8, 9)>
<2, (0, 1, 9)>
<5, (0, 4, 8)>
<6, (3, 4, 7)>

Thus, the final answer is [5].
