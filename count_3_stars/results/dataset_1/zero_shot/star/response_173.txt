Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (4, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph.

<0, (2, 7, 9)>
<1, (4, 8, 0)>
<2, (0, 7, 9)>
<2, (5, 6, 7)>
<5, (2, 7, 0)>
<6, (2, 9, 0)>
