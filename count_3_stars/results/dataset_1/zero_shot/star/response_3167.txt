Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) 

Response:
There are 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<6, (0, 7, 1)>
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
