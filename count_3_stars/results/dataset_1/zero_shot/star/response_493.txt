Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here are the 3-stars found:
    <0, (1, 4, 5)>
    <1, (0, 2, 3)>
    <3, (1, 4, 6)>
    <4, (0, 1, 3)>
    
Therefore, the final answer is [4].
