Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are four 3-stars in the given graph. 
The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<1, (0, 6, 8)>
<2, (0, 5, 7)>
<6, (1, 8, 9)>
Therefore, the answer is [4].
