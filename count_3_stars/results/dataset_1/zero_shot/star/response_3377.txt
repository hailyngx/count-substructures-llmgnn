Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 8 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The final answer is [8].

The 3-stars are:
<0, (7, 1, 5)>
<1, (3, 5, 7)>
<2, (7, 9, 6)>
<4, (5, 8, 9)>
<5, (1, 4, 8)>
<6, (7, 9, 2)>
<7, (0, 1, 5)>
<9, (2, 4, 6)>
