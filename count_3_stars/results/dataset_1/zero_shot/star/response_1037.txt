Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph contains the following 3-stars and the count is [4]:
<0, (4, 5, 7)>
<5, (0, 1, 6)>
<6, (4, 5, 7)>
<7, (0, 6, 9)>
