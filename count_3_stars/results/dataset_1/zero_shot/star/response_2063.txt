Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph, which can be represented as follows:
[<0, (1, 3, 5)>, <1, (0, 3, 6)>, <4, (2, 9, 8)>, <7, (0, 1, 5)>]
