Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

```
  0 ---- 7 ---- 5
  |       |       |
  8 ---- 9 ---- 3
   \            /
      \       /
          6
```

There are six 3-stars in this graph, which are:
<0, (7, 8, 9)>
<7, (0, 5, 8)>
<5, (7, 3, 0)>
<9, (8, 4, 6)>
<3, (8, 5, 4)>
<6, (9, 2, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
