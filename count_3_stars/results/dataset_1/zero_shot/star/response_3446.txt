Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
There are two 3-stars in the given graph. The unique 3-stars are as follows:
<1, (0, 4, 6)>
<8, (0, 3, 7)>
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
