Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph contains the following 3-stars:
- <0, (1, 7, 8)>
- <1, (0, 2, 3)>
- <1, (4, 6, 7)>
- <2, (1, 4, 7)>
- <3, (1, 7, 0)>
- <4, (1, 2, 7)>
- <5, (7, 0, 8)>
- <6, (1, 7, 9)>
- <7, (0, 1, 2)>
- <8, (0, 5, 7)>
- <9, (6, 1, 7)>

Therefore, there are [11] 3-stars in the given graph.
