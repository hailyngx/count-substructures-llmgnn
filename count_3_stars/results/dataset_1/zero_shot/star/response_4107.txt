Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The answer is [6].
    
    <0, (1, 7, 9)>
    <1, (0, 7, 9)>
    <2, (3, 4, 5)>
    <3, (1, 2, 4)>
    <4, (2, 5, 7)>
    <5, (1, 2, 4)>
