Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [3] 3-stars in the given graph.  

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (9, 2, 7)>  
<2, (6, 5, 9)>  
<7, (1, 3, 9)>
