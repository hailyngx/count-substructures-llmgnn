Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The answer is [4].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (5, 3, 1)>
<1, (2, 4, 3)>
<7, (4, 8, 2)>
<9, (6, 8, 8)>
