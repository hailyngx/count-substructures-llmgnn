Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are listed below:

<1, (3, 5, 9)>
<2, (4, 5, 6)>
<5, (1, 2, 8)>
<7, (0, 6, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
