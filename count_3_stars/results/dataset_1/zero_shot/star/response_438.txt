Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 3-star configurations  present in the given graph. 
The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 8, 0)>
<1, (3, 7, 1)>
<3, (8, 7, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
