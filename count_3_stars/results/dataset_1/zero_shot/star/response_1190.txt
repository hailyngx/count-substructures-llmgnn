Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [\[3\]] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 9, 1)>
<3, (0, 1, 4)>
<4, (3, 5, 7)>
