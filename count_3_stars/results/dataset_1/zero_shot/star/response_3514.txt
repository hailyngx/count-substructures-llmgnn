Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 3, 8)>
<1, (3, 7, 8)>
<2, (6, 7, 8)>
<3, (0, 1, 8)>
<6, (2, 4, 9)>
<7, (1, 2, 5)>
