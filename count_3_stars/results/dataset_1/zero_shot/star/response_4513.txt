Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
  
The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 2, 6)>
<1, (0, 8, 9)>
<2, (0, 4, 7)>
<4, (2, 3, 7)>
