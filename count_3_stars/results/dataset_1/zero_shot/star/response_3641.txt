Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The count of 3-stars is [5].
    
    <1, (2, 4, 5)>
    <2, (1, 6, 9)>
    <4, (5, 6, 7)>
    <5, (1, 2, 4)>
    <9, (2, 7, 8)>
