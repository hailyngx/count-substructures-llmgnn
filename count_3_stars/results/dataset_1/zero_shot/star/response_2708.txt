Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are <0, (1, 2, 4)>, <4, (0, 5, 8)>, and <6, (2, 3, 7)> 3-star structures in this graph. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
