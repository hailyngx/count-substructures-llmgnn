Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 7, 8)>
<1, (2, 4, 5)>
<2, (1, 4, 5)>
<3, (0, 7, 8)>
<4, (2, 5, 6)>
<5, (1, 3, 4)>
