Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<0, (1, 3, 9)>
<0, (2, 4, 9)>
<0, (5, 6, 9)>
<1, (0, 6, 7)>
<2, (0, 4, 9)>
<5, (0, 6, 8)>
<9, (0, 4, 7)>
