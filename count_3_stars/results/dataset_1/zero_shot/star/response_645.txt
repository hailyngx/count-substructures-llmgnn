Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 6, 9)>
<2, (4, 5, 8)>
<3, (5, 7, 9)>
<4, (0, 2, 8)>
<5, (2, 3, 9)>
<8, (4, 5, 7)>
