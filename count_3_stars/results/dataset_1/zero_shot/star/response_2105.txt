Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [10] nodes and [32] edges in the given graph. Let's find the number of 3-stars within this graph.

First, let's create the adjacency list for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0 connects with Nodes 3 and 9
- Node 1 connects with Nodes 3 and 9
- Node 2 connects with Nodes 3 and 8
- Node 3 connects with Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, and 8
- Node 4 connects with Nodes 3 and 5
- Node 5 connects with Node 4
- Node 6 connects with Nodes 3, 4, 7, 8, and 9
- Node 7 connects with Nodes 3, 6, and 9
- Node 8 connects with Nodes 2, 3, and 6
- Node 9 connects with Nodes 0, 1, 6, and 7

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:
- From node 0: <0, (3, 9)>
- From node 1: <1, (3, 9)>
- From node 2: <2, (3, 8)>
- From node 3: <3, (0, 1, 2)> <3, (4, 6, 7)> <3, (6, 7, 8)> <3, (0, 4, 6)>
- From node 4: <4, (3, 5)>
- From node 6: <6, (3, 7, 8)> <6, (4, 7, 9)> <6, (2, 3, 8)> <6, (0, 7, 9)> <6, (4, 5, 7)>
- From node 7: <7, (3, 6, 9)>
- From node 8: <8, (3, 6, 2)>
- From node 9: <9, (3, 6, 7)> <9, (1, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [13]. The unique 3-stars found are <0, (3, 9)>, <1, (3, 9)>, <2, (3, 8)>, <3, (0, 1, 2)>, <3, (4, 6, 7)>, <3, (6, 7, 8)>, <3, (0, 4, 6)>, <4, (3, 5)>, <6, (3, 7, 8)>, <6, (4, 7, 9)>, <6, (2, 3, 8)>, <6, (0, 7, 9)>, <7, (3, 6, 9)>
