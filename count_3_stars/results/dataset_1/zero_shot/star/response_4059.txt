Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of unique 3-stars in the given graph is [8].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 5, 7)>
<2, (5, 6, 8)>
<2, (6, 3, 8)>
<0, (5, 2, 8)>
<7, (0, 8, 9)>
<8, (2, 5, 6)>
<8, (5, 6, 7)>
<6, (2, 3, 8)>
