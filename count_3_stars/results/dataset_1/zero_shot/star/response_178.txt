Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
There are [8] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars: 
<2, (4, 5, 9)>
<4, (2, 7, 8)>
<5, (2, 3, 6)>
<6, (0, 2, 8)>
<7, (4, 8, 2)>
<8, (4, 6, 7)>
<9, (2, 4, 5)>
<0, (6, 2, 8)>
