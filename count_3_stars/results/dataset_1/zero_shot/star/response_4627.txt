Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The count is determined as follows:

1. Start with the center node 0: (0, 2, 4, 6)
2. Move to the center node 1: (1, 4, 5, 6)
3. Move to the center node 2: (2, 0, 4, 6)
4. Move to the center node 3: (3, 5, 6, 9)

Therefore, the final answer is [4].  
The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (2, 4, 6)>,
<1, (4, 5, 6)>,
<2, (0, 4, 6)>,
<3, (5, 6, 9)>.
