Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph contains the following 3-stars:
1. <1, (3, 7, 9)>
2. <2, (3, 4, 6)>
3. <3, (1, 2, 4)>
4. <4, (2, 3, 5)>
5. <5, (4, 5, 6)>
6. <6, (2, 5, 6)>
7. <7, (1, 8, 9)>
8. <8, (0, 7, 9)>
9. <9, (1, 2, 3)>
