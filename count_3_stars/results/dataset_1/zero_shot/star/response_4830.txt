Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 5) (3, 1) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here is the list of these 3-stars:

<0, (9, 8, 1)>
<1, (3, 6, 6)>
<2, (5, 6, 5)>
<6, (1, 4, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
