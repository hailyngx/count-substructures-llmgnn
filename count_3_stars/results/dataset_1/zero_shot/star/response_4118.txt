Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (0, 3, 5)>
<2, (3, 5, 8)>
<3, (1, 2, 5)>
<5, (2, 3, 4)>
<5, (3, 4, 6)>
<7, (3, 5, 6)>
