Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars: 
<0, (1, 5, 9)>
<2, (6, 4, 8)>
<4, (5, 6, 8)>
<5, (0, 4, 9)>
