Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [2] 3-stars in the given graph. 
The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (6, 7, 9)>
<7, (1, 2, 9)>
