Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 3) 

Response:
The 3-star count in this graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 7, 8)>
<2, (6, 7, 8)>
<3, (4, 5, 9)>
<4, (0, 3, 5)>
<5, (3, 4, 9)>
<8, (0, 1, 2)>
