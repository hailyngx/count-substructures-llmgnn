Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 6) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 3 unique 3-stars in this graph. The count is [3].
   
The 3-stars are:
<4, (2, 3, 5)>
<5, (3, 4, 8)>
<6, (1, 4, 9)>
