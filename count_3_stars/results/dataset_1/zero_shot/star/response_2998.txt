Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 1, 3)>
<1, (4, 0, 7)>
<2, (3, 7, 1)>
<3, (2, 4, 0)>
<4, (0, 1, 3)>
<6, (8, 9, 1)>
<7, (1, 4, 2)>
<8, (6, 7, 9)>
