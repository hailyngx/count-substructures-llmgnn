Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph:
<0, (3, 4, 6)>
<0, (4, 6, 7)>
<0, (6, 4, 7)>
<0, (4, 7, 9)>
<4, (0, 6, 7)>
<7, (0, 2, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
