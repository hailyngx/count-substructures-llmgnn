Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The count is calculated by counting the number of nodes connected to each node.

Here are the 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (3, 5, 7)>
<1, (2, 4, 5)>
<2, (1, 3, 5)>
<4, (1, 5, 7)>
<5, (0, 2, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
