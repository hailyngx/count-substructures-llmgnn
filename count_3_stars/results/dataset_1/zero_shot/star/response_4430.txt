Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (6, 9, 1)>
<4, (1, 2, 5)>
<5, (1, 2, 8)>
<8, (1, 3, 5)>
