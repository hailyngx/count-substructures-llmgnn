Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in this graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<3, (1, 2, 7)>
<9, (1, 6, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
