Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are listed inside <>:
<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<1, (0, 5, 6)>
<4, (5, 8, 9)>
<5, (0, 1, 4)>
Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
