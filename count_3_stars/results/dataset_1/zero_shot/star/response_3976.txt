Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<2, (0, 3, 5)>
<5, (1, 2, 3)>
<5, (4, 6, 8)>
