Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are [20] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 3, 9)>
<1, (0, 2, 8)>
<2, (1, 3, 5)>
<3, (0, 2, 5)>
<5, (2, 3, 8)>
<6, (3, 5, 9)>
