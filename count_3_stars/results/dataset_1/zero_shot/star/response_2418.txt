Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (5, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 8 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here is the list of the unique 3-stars:

<1, (2, 8, 9)>
<2, (1, 3, 7)>
<2, (3, 6, 9)>
<3, (2, 4, 8)>
<6, (8, 9, 3)>
<7, (0, 2, 8)>
<8, (6, 7, 1)>
<9, (1, 2, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
