Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
The 3-stars are: 
    <0, (4, 6, 7)>
    <1, (6, 7, 2)>
    <2, (7, 8, 9)>
    <3, (6, 8, 0)>
  
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [4].
