Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 7, 8)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<3, (1, 4, 9)>
<4, (1, 2, 7)>

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
