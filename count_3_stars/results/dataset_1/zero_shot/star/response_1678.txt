Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (3, 5, 9)>
<1, (5, 7, 6)>
<2, (7, 9, 6)>
