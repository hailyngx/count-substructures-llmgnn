Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<1, (0, 4, 9)>
<3, (4, 5, 6)>
<4, (0, 1, 2)>
