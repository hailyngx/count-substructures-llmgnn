Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 5) (3, 5) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) 

Response:
There are 3 unique 3-stars in this graph. Here they are:

<5, (1, 3, 4)>
<6, (5, 7, 7)>
<7, (0, 5, 6)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
