Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 9, 1)>
<1, (2, 8, 7)>
<2, (0, 8, 9)>
<9, (0, 8, 4)>
