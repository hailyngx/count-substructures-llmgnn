Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) 

Response:
There are 3 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here is the list of these 3-stars:

<1, (2, 4, 5)>
<2, (0, 1, 8)>
<4, (1, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
