Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].  
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (3, 4, 7)>
<0, (3, 7, 9)>
<0, (4, 7, 8)>
<1, (5, 7, 8)>
<1, (5, 8, 9)>
<2, (6, 4, 9)>
<4, (6, 8, 9)>
<5, (8, 9, 1)>
