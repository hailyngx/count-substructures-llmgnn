Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].

The unique 3-stars found are:
    <0, (1, 5, 6)>
    <1, (0, 2, 8)>
