Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are four 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are listed within <>:

<0, (2, 5, 6)>
<2, (0, 4, 9)>
<5, (0, 2, 6)>
<7, (4, 5, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
