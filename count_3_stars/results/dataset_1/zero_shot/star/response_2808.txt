Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
   
   <0, (5, 4, 6)>
   <1, (8, 2, 9)>
   <2, (9, 1, 8)>
   <4, (5, 0, 6)>
   <5, (4, 0, 6)>
   <8, (1, 2, 9)>
