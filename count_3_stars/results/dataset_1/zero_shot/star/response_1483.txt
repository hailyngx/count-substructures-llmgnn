Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (5, 9, 1)>
<1, (2, 6, 7)>
<1, (7, 3, 8)>
<2, (1, 3, 8)>
