Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 different 3-stars in this graph. Here they are listed inside <>:
<0, (2, 1, 7)>
<2, (0, 1, 4)>
<4, (1, 2, 6)>
<8, (3, 5, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
