Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be found by examining all the nodes and their connections. 

First, let's identify the nodes that can serve as the central node of a 3-star. For each of these potential central nodes, we will check if they are connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern.

After analyzing the edges provided, the nodes that can be central nodes of 3-stars are: 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, and 8.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars based on these central nodes:

- For node 0: <0, (1, 2, 6)>
- For node 1: <1, (0, 6, 7)>
- For node 2: <2, (0, 3, 9)>
- For node 5: <5, (4, 6, 9)>
- For node 6: <6, (0, 1, 5)>
- For node 8: <8, (4, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
