Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 7, 8)>
<0, (4, 5, 9)>
<1, (0, 3, 9)>
<2, (4, 5, 8)>
<2, (5, 6, 9)>
<4, (0, 2, 9)>
<5, (0, 2, 8)>
<9, (1, 4, 7)>
