Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (5, 0) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
There are <0, (2, 5, 7)>, <1, (4, 8, 9)>, and <3, (6, 7, 8)> 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
