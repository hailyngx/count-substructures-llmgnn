Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are two 3-stars in the given graph. The unique 3-stars are as follows:
<3, (0, 1, 6)>
<7, (1, 4, 5)>
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
