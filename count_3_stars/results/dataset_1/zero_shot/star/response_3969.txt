Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].  
The unique 3-stars are:  
<0, (3, 4, 7)>  
<1, (4, 3, 7)>  
<2, (7, 8, 9)>  
<4, (1, 3, 6)>  
<6, (4, 9, 1)>  
<7, (1, 2, 3)>  
<8, (2, 7, 9)>  
<9, (2, 6, 2)>
