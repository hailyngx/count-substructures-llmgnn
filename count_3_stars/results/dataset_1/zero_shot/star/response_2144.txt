Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are three 3-star subgraphs in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (2, 6, 7)>
<2, (1, 3, 4)>
<4, (2, 3, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
