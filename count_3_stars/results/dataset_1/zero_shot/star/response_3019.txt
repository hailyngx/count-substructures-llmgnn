Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 8 3-stars in this graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 6, 8)>
<0, (3, 8, 9)>
<1, (2, 7, 8)>
<2, (1, 3, 8)>
<3, (0, 2, 8)>
<3, (4, 5, 7)>
<4, (3, 6, 8)>
<7, (1, 4, 8)>

Therefore, the final answer is [8].
