Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 3 unique 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <6, (0, 1, 9)>
2. <7, (1, 5, 8)>
3. <4, (2, 3, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
