Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are part of any 3-star in the graph by checking for nodes with exactly 3 neighbors.
The nodes with exactly 3 neighbors are: 0, 1, 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9.

Now we need to find all the 3-stars in the graph using these nodes. Let's start listing them:
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<1, (0, 2, 4)>
<4, (1, 2, 5)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
