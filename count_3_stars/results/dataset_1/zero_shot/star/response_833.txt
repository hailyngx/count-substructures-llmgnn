Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [7] 3-stars in the given graph.  
Here are the unique 3-stars:  
<0, (2, 4, 5)>  
<1, (4, 7, 5)>  
<2, (0, 4, 9)>  
<2, (3, 4, 9)>  
<3, (2, 5, 9)>  
<5, (3, 7, 8)>  
<7, (1, 5, 8)>
