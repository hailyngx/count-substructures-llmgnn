Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is equal to the number of nodes with exactly three neighbors. Let's go ahead and find them:

Here are the nodes with their neighbors:
- Node 0: {1, 2}
- Node 1: {0, 6}
- Node 2: {0, 6, 9}
- Node 3: {6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 3}
- Node 7: {3, 8}
- Node 8: {3, 7}
- Node 9: {2, 3}

As we can see, the nodes with exactly three neighbors are: 2 and 9. So, there are 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

The 3-stars are:
<2, (0, 6, 9)>
<9, (2, 3, 6)>

Therefore, the final answer is [<2, (0, 6, 9)>, <9, (2, 3, 6)>].
