Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 8 total 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 3, 5)>
<0, (2, 6, 8)>
<0, (3, 5, 7)>
<0, (5, 7, 8)>
<1, (5, 7, 9)>
<1, (5, 7, 8)>
<3, (0, 8, 9)>
<5, (0, 1, 9)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
