Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Counting the number of 3-stars in the given graph:
    1. Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 6, and 8: <0, (5, 6, 8)>
    2. Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 4, and 6: <2, (1, 4, 6)>
    3. Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 2, and 4: <6, (0, 2, 4)>
    4. Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 6, and 7: <9, (1, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
