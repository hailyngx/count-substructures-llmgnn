Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of 3-star subgraphs is 2.

The unique 3-stars found in the given graph are:
<1, (2, 3, 7)>
<4, (2, 7, 8)> 

Therefore, the final answer is [2].
