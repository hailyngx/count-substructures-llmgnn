Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
The center nodes in this graph are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9.

Calculating the number of 3-star structures in the graph:

For center node 0: (0, 3, 5), (0, 5, 6) [2 3-stars]
For center node 1: None
For center node 2: (2, 5, 7) [1 3-star]
For center node 3: (3, 0, 4), (3, 4, 5), (3, 4, 9) [3 3-stars]
For center node 4: (4, 1, 6), (4, 3, 5), (4, 5, 6), (4, 6, 7) [4 3-stars]
For center node 5: (5, 0, 2), (5, 2, 4), (5, 4, 7) [3 3-stars]
For center node 6: (6, 0, 1), (6, 1, 4), (6, 4, 7) [3 3-stars]
For center node 7: (7, 2, 4), (7, 4, 5), (7, 5, 6) [3 3-stars]
For center node 9: None

Therefore, there are a total of [19 3-stars] in the given graph, each uniquely represented as follows:
<0, (3, 5, 6)>, <2, (5, 7)>, <3, (0, 4, 5)>, <3, (4, 5, 9)>, <4, (1, 6)>, <4, (3, 5)>, <4, (5, 6)>, <4, (6, 7)>, <5, (0, 2)>, <5, (2, 4)>, <5, (4, 7)>, <6, (0, 1)>, <6, (1, 4)>, <6, (4, 7)>, <7, (2, 4)>, <7, (4, 5)>, <7, (5, 6)>.
