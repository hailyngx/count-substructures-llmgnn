Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
The total number of 3-star graphs can be calculated based on the number of nodes connected to node 0 in the given graph. Since a 3-star graph consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes, we need to identify nodes that are directly connected to node 0 while ensuring they are not already connected to each other.

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the given graph along with their central node and leaf nodes:
<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<0, (6, 8, 9)>

Hence, the total number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [2].
