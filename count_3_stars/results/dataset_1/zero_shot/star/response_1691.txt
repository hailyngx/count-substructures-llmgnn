Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:
[<0, (2, 4, 1)>, <2, (0, 5, 6)>, <4, (0, 1, 7)>, <5, (2, 6, 0)>, <6, (5, 7, 2)>, <7, (1, 6, 9)>]

Thus, there are a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
