Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph. 

<0, (3, 4, 6)>
<1, (6, 7, 9)>
<2, (3, 9, 0)>
<3, (0, 2, 4)>
<4, (0, 3, 6)>
<6, (1, 4, 7)>
