Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The central nodes for 3-stars can be determined by checking the nodes with degree 3 in the given graph. Let's first list them:
- Node 2 has degree 5
- Node 3 has degree 5
- Node 4 has degree 3
- Node 5 has degree 4
- Node 6 has degree 5
- Node 7 has degree 5
- Node 8 has degree 2
- Node 9 has degree 5

Therefore, the central nodes for 3-stars are nodes 4 and 8. Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
- <4, (3, 8, 9)>
- <8, (3, 4, 9)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
