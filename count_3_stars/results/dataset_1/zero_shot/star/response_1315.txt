Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (0, 2, 6)>
<3, (5, 7, 9)>
<6, (1, 4, 9)>
<7, (1, 3, 8)>
