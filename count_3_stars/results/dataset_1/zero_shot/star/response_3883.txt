Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<1, (0, 5, 7)>
<4, (0, 5, 7)>
<5, (0, 1, 4)>
<7, (1, 4, 8)>
<8, (0, 7, 9)>
