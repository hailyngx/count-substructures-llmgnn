Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 8 3-stars in the given graph. 
The list of unique 3-stars is as follows: 
<0, (2, 5, 7)>
<1, (2, 7, 8)>
<2, (0, 1, 5)>
<2, (1, 5, 7)>
<4, (5, 7, 9)>
<5, (0, 2, 4)>
<5, (2, 4, 6)>
<5, (4, 6, 9)>

Therefore, the final answer is [8].
