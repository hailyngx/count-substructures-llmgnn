Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are a total of [12] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<1, (2, 4, 5)>
<1, (5, 8, 9)>
<2, (1, 5, 9)>
<3, (0, 5, 8)>
<4, (1, 6, 7)>
<5, (0, 1, 2)>
<5, (3, 9, 1)>
<6, (0, 4, 7)>
<7, (4, 6, 8)>
<8, (1, 3, 7)>
<9, (1, 5, 0)>
