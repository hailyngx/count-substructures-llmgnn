Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (3, 4, 6)>
<3, (0, 7, 8)>
<5, (6, 8, _)>
<7, (1, 3, 8)>
<8, (3, 5, 7)>
