Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are 3 unique 3-stars in this graph. The count of 3-stars is [3].
The unique 3-stars are <0, (1, 9, 3)>, <2, (4, 6, 7)>, <3, (4, 9, 0)>.
