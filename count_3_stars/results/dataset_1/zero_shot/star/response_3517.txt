Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [8] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (6, 7, 9)>
<1, (2, 5, 8)>
<1, (5, 3, 8)>
<1, (8, 3, 5)>
<3, (5, 6, 8)>
<3, (6, 0, 8)>
<3, (8, 1, 5)>
<9, (4, 7, 1)>
