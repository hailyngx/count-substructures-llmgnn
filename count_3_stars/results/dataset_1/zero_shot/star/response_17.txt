Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. To find the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all the 3-stars present.

Calculating the degree of each node:
- Node 0 has degree 3
- Node 1 has degree 5
- Node 2 has degree 2
- Node 3 has degree 4
- Node 4 has degree 4
- Node 5 has degree 4
- Node 6 has degree 3
- Node 7 has degree 4
- Node 8 has degree 2
- Node 9 has degree 5

Now, let's list the unique 3-star structures:
<0, (4, 6, 7)>
<1, (3, 5, 7)>
<4, (0, 1, 6)>
<5, (1, 3, 7)>
<6, (0, 4, 7)>
<7, (0, 1, 5)>
<9, (1, 2, 5)>

Count of 3-stars: [7]
