Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are <0, (1, 6, 2)>, <1, (0, 2, 3)>, <2, (1, 3, 6)>, <3, (1, 2, 9)>, <4, (7,)> 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
