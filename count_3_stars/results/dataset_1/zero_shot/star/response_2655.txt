Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 4 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are:

[4, (1, 6, 8)]
[6, (1, 2, 3)]
[1, (4, 6, 7)]
[9, (0, 4, 5)] 

Therefore, the final answer is: [4].
