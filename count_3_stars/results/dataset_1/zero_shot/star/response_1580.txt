Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be found by counting the number of nodes that can act as the central node of a 3-star. Since each 3-star has exactly 3 leaves and there should be a one-to-one correspondence between central nodes and their respective leaves, we can count the total possible 3-stars by counting the number of nodes that have 3 or more neighbors.

Let's identify the nodes that can be central nodes of 3-stars based on the number of neighbors each node has:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors (3, 4, 7, 8)
- Node 7 has 6 neighbors (0, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9)

Therefore, nodes 0 and 7 can act as central nodes of 3-stars. 

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2]. The unique 3-stars are <0, (3, 4, 7)> and <7, (0, 5, 9)>.
