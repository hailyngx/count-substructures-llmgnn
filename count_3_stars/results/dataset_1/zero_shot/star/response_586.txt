Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars along with their central node and leaves:
    - <0, (1, 3, 5)>
    - <1, (0, 5, 8)>
    - <2, (5, 7, 8)>
    - <3, (0, 8, 8)>
    - <5, (1, 2, 8)>
    - <7, (2, 8, 8)>
    - <8, (3, 5, 7)>
    
    There are a total of [7] 3-stars in the graph.
