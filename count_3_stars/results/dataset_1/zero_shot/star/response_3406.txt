Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are a total of 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are listed inside <>:

<0, (1, 6, 9)>
<3, (0, 6, 9)>
<6, (0, 3, 9)>
<9, (0, 3, 6)>

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
