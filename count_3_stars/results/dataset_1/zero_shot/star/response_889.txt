Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The graph consists of the following 3-stars:
- <0, (1, 3, 5)>
- <1, (0, 2, 9)>
- <2, (1, 4, 9)>
- <3, (0, 6, 9)>
- <4, (2, 6, 7)>
- <5, (0, 6, 6)>
- <6, (4, 5, 7)>
- <7, (4, 6, 7)>
- <9, (1, 2, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
