Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are three unique 3-stars in the given graph. The three 3-stars are: <2, (4, 8, 9)>, <4, (2, 9, 5)>, and <5, (1, 3, 6)>. 
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
