Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.  

The unique 3-stars are:  
<2, (4, 5, 9)>  
<4, (0, 2, 3)>  
<6, (1, 8, 6)>  
<9, (2, 4, 7)>
