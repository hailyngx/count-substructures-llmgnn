Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:
[<0, (4, 5, 1)>, <2, (6, 7, 9)>, <5, (0, 1, 8)>, <6, (2, 7, 8)>] 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
