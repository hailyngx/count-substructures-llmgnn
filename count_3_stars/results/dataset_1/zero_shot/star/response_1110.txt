Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in this graph. Here they are:
  
<0, (1, 3, 8)>
<1, (0, 4, 5)>
<3, (0, 7, 9)>
<4, (1, 2, 5)>
<5, (1, 6, 8)>
<7, (3, 6, 9)>

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
