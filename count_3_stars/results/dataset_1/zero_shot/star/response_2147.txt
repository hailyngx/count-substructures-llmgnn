Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

[6]

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 3, 6)>
<1, (2, 3, 4)>
<2, (0, 1, 6)>
<3, (0, 1, 6)>
<4, (1, 3, 6)>
<7, (0, 1, 5)>
