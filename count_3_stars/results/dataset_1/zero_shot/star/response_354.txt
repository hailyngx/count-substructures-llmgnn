Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be counted by finding all the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Upon inspection of the given graph, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (2, 5, 8)>
<2, (0, 3, 9)>
<3, (1, 2, 5)>
<4, (1, 5, 6)>
<5, (0, 3, 4)>
<6, (5, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 6, 9)>
<9, (2, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
