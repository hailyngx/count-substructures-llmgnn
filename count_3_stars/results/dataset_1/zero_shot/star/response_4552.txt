Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 7, 8)>
<0, (2, 8, 9)>
<4, (2, 5, 6)>
<4, (2, 6, 9)>
<4, (5, 6, 9)>
<9, (5, 6, 8)>
