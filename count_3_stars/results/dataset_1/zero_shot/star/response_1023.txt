Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph contains the following 3-stars:
- <0, (1, 2, 4)>
- <1, (0, 3, 5)>
- <2, (0, 6, 7)>
- <4, (0, 5, 8)>
- <8, (1, 4, 6)>
- <9, (1, 4, 6)>

Therefore, there are [6] 3-stars in total.
