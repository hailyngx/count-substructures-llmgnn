Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<3, (0, 1, 6)>
<3, (2, 4, 9)>
<4, (0, 3, 5)>
<9, (2, 3, 3)>
