Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The final answer is [4].

The 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 9, 1)>
<3, (0, 2, 4)>
<2, (1, 3, 5)>
<8, (3, 4, 5)>
