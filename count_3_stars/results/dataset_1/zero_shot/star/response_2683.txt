Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to node 2.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 6 and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 8, and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 7 and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to node 5 and 7.
- Node 5 is connected to node 4.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 8, and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 6.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 6, and 7.

To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we will look for each possible central node and its corresponding connected nodes. Then we check if these connected nodes are connected to each other to form a 3-star.

In this graph, we have the following 3-stars: 
[<2, (0, 8, 9)>, <6, (1, 8, 9)>, <9, (1, 6, 7)>]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
