Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The unique 3-stars in the given graph are:
<0, (1, 7, 9)>
<1, (0, 3, 5)>
<2, (4, 9, 0)>
<3, (1, 6, 0)>
<4, (2, 8, 5)>
<5, (1, 4, 6)>
<6, (3, 5, 7)>
<7, (0, 5, 6)>
<8, (4, 5, 9)>
<9, (0, 4, 6)>

Count of 3-stars: [10]
