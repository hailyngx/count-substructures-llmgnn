Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (4, 0) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are a total of 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 6, 8)>
<1, (9, 2, 0)>
<2, (6, 7, 9)>
<6, (0, 2, 9)>
<7, (2, 6, 0)>
<9, (1, 2, 6)>

Therefore, the final answer is [6].
