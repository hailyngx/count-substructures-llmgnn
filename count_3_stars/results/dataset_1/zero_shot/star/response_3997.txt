Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 12 3-stars in the given graph.
The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<1, (2, 8, 9)>
<2, (1, 4, 6)>
<2, (6, 7, 8)>
<4, (0, 2, 5)>
<5, (0, 3, 4)>
<5, (7, 8, 9)>
<6, (2, 7, 9)>
<7, (5, 8, 9)>
<8, (1, 5, 7)>
<8, (5, 7, 9)>
<9, (5, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the final answer is [12].
