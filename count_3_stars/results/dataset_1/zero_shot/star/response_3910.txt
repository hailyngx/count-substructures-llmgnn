Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 2) (8, 6) 

Response:
There are 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph, the count of which is [2].
    
    <2, (0, 1, 3)>
    <3, (1, 4, 6)>
