Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 8, 5)>
<1, (0, 8, 5)>
<5, (1, 8, 4)>
