Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 6) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 3 unique 3-star structures in the given graph. Here they are:

<0, (1, 8, 9)>
<1, (0, 9, 4)>
<9, (1, 8, 5)>

Therefore, the final count of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
