Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 7 3-stars in the given graph. Here is the list of 3-stars found:

[<0, (3, 6, 8)>, <1, (5, 7, 9)>, <3, (0, 6, 7)>, <5, (1, 9, 7)>, <6, (0, 7, 9)>, <7, (1, 6, 8)>, <9, (5, 6, 7)>]
