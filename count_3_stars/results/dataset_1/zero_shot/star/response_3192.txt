Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are: 
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<2, (1, 3, 7)>
<3, (1, 2, 6)>
<6, (2, 3, 9)>
<7, (2, 8, 9)>
<8, (1, 6, 7)>

There are a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
