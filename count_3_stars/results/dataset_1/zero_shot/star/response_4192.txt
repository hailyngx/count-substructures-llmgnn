Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of 3-star structures in the given graph is [12].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (3, 5, 8)>
<1, (2, 6, 8)>
<2, (1, 4, 6)>
<3, (0, 1, 8)>
<4, (2, 3, 5)>
<5, (0, 4, 7)>
<6, (1, 2, 4)>
<7, (3, 4, 6)>
<8, (0, 1, 3)>
<9, (2, 7, 8)>
<1, (6, 8, 2)>
<3, (8, 1, 0)>
