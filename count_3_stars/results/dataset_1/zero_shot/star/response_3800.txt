Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The 3-stars are as follows:

<0, (3, 8, 9)>
<3, (0, 2, 8)>
<4, (1, 7, 5)>
<5, (6, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
