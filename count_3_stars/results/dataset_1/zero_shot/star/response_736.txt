Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (5, 6, 7)>
<1, (4, 6, 9)>
<2, (3, 5, 8)>
<3, (2, 4, 6)>
<4, (1, 3, 5)>
<5, (0, 2, 9)>
