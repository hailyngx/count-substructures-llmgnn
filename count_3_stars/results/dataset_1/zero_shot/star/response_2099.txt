Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are 3-star configurations in the given graph, which are:
    <0, (1, 5, 8)>
    <1, (0, 2, 7)>
    <2, (1, 3, 9)>
    <3, (2, 4, 8)>
    <4, (0, 3, 7)>
    <5, (0, 3, 7)>
    <6, (0, 4, 7)>
    <7, (0, 2, 4)>
    <8, (0, 3, 8)>
    <9, (2, 3, 9)>
  
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
