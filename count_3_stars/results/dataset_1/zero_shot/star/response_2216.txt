Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (4, 5, 8)>
<2, (1, 3, 7)>
<4, (1, 5, 7)>
<5, (1, 4, 9)>
