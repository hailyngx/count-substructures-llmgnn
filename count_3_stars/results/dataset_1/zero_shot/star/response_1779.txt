Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are as follows:
<0, (3, 5, 1)>
<3, (0, 5, 6)>
<5, (0, 3, 1)>
<7, (1, 3, 4)>
<9, (3, 8, 6)>

Therefore, there are a total of [5] 3-stars in the graph.
