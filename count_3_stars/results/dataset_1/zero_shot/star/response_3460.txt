Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].

The unique 3-stars found in the given graph are:
<0, (4, 3, 7)>
<1, (3, 8, 2)>
<2, (7, 8, 6)>
<3, (1, 4, 9)>
<4, (0, 7, 3)>
<5, (8, 9, 3)>
<6, (7, 8, 2)>
<9, (3, 5, 8)>
<8, (1, 3, 6)>
<7, (2, 4, 6)>
