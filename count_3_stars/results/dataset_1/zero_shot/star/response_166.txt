Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of 3-star subgraphs can be calculated by counting the number of nodes that can act as the central node of a 3-star and then determining how many leaves are adjacent to that central node. 

In this graph, the possible center nodes are nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, and 9 since they each have exactly 3 neighbors. Let's go through each center node and count how many 3-star subgraphs can be formed:

1. Center node 0: (0, 1, 5), (0, 5, 8) -> Total: 2
2. Center node 1: (1, 0, 8), (1, 2, 4), (1, 7, 9) -> Total: 3
3. Center node 2: (2, 1, 8) -> Total: 1
4. Center node 3: (3, 2, 5), (3, 5, 7), (3, 5, 9) -> Total: 3
5. Center node 5: (5, 0, 8), (5, 3, 4), (5, 3, 9), (5, 4, 8), (5, 8, 9) -> Total: 5
6. Center node 7: (7, 1, 9), (7, 3, 9) -> Total: 2
7. Center node 8: (8, 0, 5), (8, 1, 2), (8, 5, 9) -> Total: 3
8. Center node 9: (9, 1, 7), (9, 3, 5), (9, 5, 8) -> Total: 3

Therefore, the total number of 3-star subgraphs in the given graph is [2 + 3 + 1 + 3 + 5 + 2 + 3 + 3] = [22].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 5, 8)>, <1, (0, 8, 2)>, <1, (4, 2, 7)>, <1, (7, 9, 1)>, <3, (2, 5, 7)>, <3, (5, 7, 9)>, <5, (0, 8, 5)>, <5, (3, 8, 4)>, <5, (3, 9, 5)>, <5, (4, 8, 5)>, <5, (8, 5, 9)>, <7, (1, 9, 7)>, <7, (3, 9, 7)>, <8, (0, 5, 8)>, <8, (1, 2, 8)>, <8, (5, 9, 8)>, <9, (1, 7, 9)>, <9, (3, 5, 9)>, <9, (5, 8, 9)>.
