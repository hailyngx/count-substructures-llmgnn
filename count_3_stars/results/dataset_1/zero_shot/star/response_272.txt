Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 0) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (4, 7, 8)>
<1, (5, 6, 7)>
<0, (7, 8, 9)>
