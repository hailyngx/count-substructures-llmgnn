Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 9) (4, 1) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are two 3-stars in the given graph.
The unique 3-stars found are:

<0, (2, 9, 1)>
<9, (0, 2, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
