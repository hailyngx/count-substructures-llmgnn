Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are numbered from 0 to 9. To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

The 3-stars in the given graph are:
<0, (3, 5, 7)>
<1, (4, 6, 7)>
<2, (3, 7, 9)>
<3, (0, 2, 4)>
<4, (1, 3, 6)>
<5, (0)>
<6, (1)>
<7, (0, 1, 2)>
<8, (6, 9)>
<9, (1, 3, 7)>

Counting these unique 3-stars, we find there are [10] 3-stars in the graph.
