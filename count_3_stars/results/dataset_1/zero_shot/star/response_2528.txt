Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be found by counting the number of times each node appears as the center node in a 3-star structure. Let's calculate that:

- Node 0: (0, 4, 5, 7, 8) -> 5 possible 3-stars
- Node 1: (1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) -> 7 possible 3-stars
- Node 2: (1, 2, 5, 9) -> 4 possible 3-stars
- Node 3: (3, 6, 7) -> 3 possible 3-stars
- Node 4: (0, 4, 6, 9) -> 4 possible 3-stars
- Node 5: (0, 1, 2, 5, 9) -> 5 possible 3-stars
- Node 6: (1, 3, 4) -> 3 possible 3-stars
- Node 7: (0, 1, 3, 7, 8) -> 5 possible 3-stars
- Node 8: (0, 1, 7, 8) -> 4 possible 3-stars
- Node 9: (1, 2, 4, 5) -> 4 possible 3-stars

Now let's list the unique 3-stars, each only once:

<0, (4, 5, 7)>
<1, (2, 8, 9)>
<2, (5, 9, 1)>
<3, (6, 7, 1)>
<4, (6, 9, 0)>
<5, (2, 0, 9)>
<6, (3, 4, 1)>
<7, (8, 0, 3)>
<8, (7, 1, 0)>
<9, (5, 2, 1)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
