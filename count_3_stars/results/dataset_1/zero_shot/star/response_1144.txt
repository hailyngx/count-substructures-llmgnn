Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 4, 1)>
<2, (4, 0, 1)>
<2, (4, 6, 7)>
<2, (4, 1, 0)>
<2, (4, 1, 7)>
<2, (4, 7, 1)>
