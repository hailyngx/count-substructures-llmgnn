Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the graph.
  
<0, (1, 3, 8)>
<1, (0, 7, 9)>
<3, (0, 4, 6)>
<2, (4, 9, 0)>
<5, (4, 6, 8)>
<9, (1, 2, 7)>
