Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [5] 3-stars in the given graph. 

Here are the unique 3-stars:
<0, (6, 9, 4)>
<3, (6, 7, 8)>
<4, (1, 8, 9)>
<6, (0, 3, 4)>
<9, (0, 7, 8)>
