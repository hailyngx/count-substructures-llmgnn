Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are:

1. <0, (3, 6, 7)>
2. <1, (4, 5, 7)>
3. <3, (0, 6, 5)>
4. <5, (1, 4, 8)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
