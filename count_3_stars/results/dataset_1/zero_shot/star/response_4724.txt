Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 5 different 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are:

<1, (2, 6, 9)>
<2, (1, 9, 3)>
<6, (1, 9, 8)>
<3, (9, 2, 7)>
<7, (8, 3, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
