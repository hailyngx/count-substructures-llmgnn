Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 3-star structures in the given graph. 

There are 5 unique 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<2, (0, 3, 8)>
<4, (0, 5, 6)>
<5, (0, 4, 8)>
<6, (0, 4, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
