Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:
- <0, (4, 9, 1)>
- <2, (3, 4, 1)>
- <3, (2, 5, 6)>
- <4, (0, 1, 2)>
- <5, (3, 7, 2)>
- <6, (3, 9, 2)>
- <7, (5, 9, 2)>
- <8, (4, 4, 4)>
- <9, (0, 6, 7)>

Counting the number of 3-stars gives us a total of [9].
