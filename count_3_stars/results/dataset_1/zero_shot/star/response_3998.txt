Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the output is:

[5]

The unique 3-stars are:

<1, (2, 3, 7)>
<2, (1, 4, 6)>
<6, (2, 5, 9)>
<7, (1, 8, 9)>
<8, (1, 4, 5)>
