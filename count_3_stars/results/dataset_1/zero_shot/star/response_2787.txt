Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

The 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<2, (0, 3, 5)>
<3, (0, 2, 7)>
<4, (0, 1, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
