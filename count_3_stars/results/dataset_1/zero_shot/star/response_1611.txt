Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated by counting the number of unique 3-star structures in the given graph. 

After analyzing the given graph, the unique 3-stars are:
1. <0, (4, 5, 7)>
2. <1, (2, 4, 6)>
3. <2, (1, 5, 6)>
4. <3, (4, 5, 9)>
5. <4, (0, 1, 3)>
6. <5, (0, 2, 4)>
7. <6, (1, 2, 8)>
8. <7, (0, 1, 8)>
9. <8, (1, 4, 6)>
10. <9, (3, 5, 0)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
