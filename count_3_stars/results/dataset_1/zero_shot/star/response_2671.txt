Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Thus, the output is [2].
    
The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (3, 7, 2)>
<3, (1, 2, 4)>
