Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-star graphs in the given graph. The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (4, 6, 8)>
<3, (1, 4, 9)>
<4, (0, 3, 5)>
<8, (0, 5, 9)>
