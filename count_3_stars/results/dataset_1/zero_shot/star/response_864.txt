Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 8 unique 3-stars in the given graph.  
The 3-stars are as follows:
<2, (3, 1, 6)>
<3, (1, 2, 5)>
<4, (5, 0, 6)>
<5, (0, 1, 4)>
<6, (1, 3, 5)>
<7, (6, 4, 8)>
<8, (6, 9, 4)>
<9, (1, 4, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
