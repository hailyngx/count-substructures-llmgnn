Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are [7] 3-stars in the given graph.

<0, (5, 7, 8)>
<1, (2, 4, 5)>
<3, (6, 7, 9)>
<4, (1, 5, 9)>
<5, (0, 1, 2)>
<6, (3, 5, 7)>
<7, (0, 1, 2)>
