Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is 3.  

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (5, 8, 2)>
<1, (3, 7, 9)>
<9, (1, 4, 7)>  

Therefore, the final answer is [3].
