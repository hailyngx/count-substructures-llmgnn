Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 0) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 7, 9)>
<1, (0, 4, 6)>
<5, (1, 3, 9)>
<6, (1, 5, 9)>
<7, (0, 1, 9)>
<9, (1, 4, 5)>
