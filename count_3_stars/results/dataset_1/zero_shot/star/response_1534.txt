Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 44 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of 3-star patterns in the given graph can be counted by looking for nodes that have exactly three edges connecting them to other nodes. Let's find these 3-star patterns:

1. Node 0: (1, 3, 5, 7, 9)
2. Node 1: (0, 6, 7, 8, 9)
3. Node 3: (0, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)
4. Node 5: (0, 3, 7, 8)
5. Node 6: (1, 3)
6. Node 7: (0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9)
7. Node 8: (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9)
8. Node 9: (0, 1, 3, 7, 8)

Therefore, we have a total of [8] 3-star patterns in this graph.

The unique 3-star patterns are:
<0, (1, 3, 5, 7, 9)>
<1, (0, 6, 7, 8, 9)>
<3, (0, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)>
<5, (0, 3, 7, 8)>
<6, (1, 3)>
<7, (0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9)>
<8, (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 3, 7, 8)>
