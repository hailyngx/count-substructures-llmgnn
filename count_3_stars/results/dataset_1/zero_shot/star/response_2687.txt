Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 2) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph has 4 unique 3-stars. Here are the 3-stars and their central nodes:
<1, (2, 6, 7)>
<2, (1, 3, 4)>
<6, (1, 3, 8)>
<7, (1, 9, -)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
