Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The 3-stars are:
<0, (5, 9, 1)>
<2, (4, 6, 5)>
<4, (2, 5, 6)>
<6, (2, 4, 9)>

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
