Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph.
The 3-stars are: 
<0, (3, 4, 6)>
<1, (2, 3, 9)>
<2, (1, 4, 9)>
<4, (2, 5, 7)>
Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
