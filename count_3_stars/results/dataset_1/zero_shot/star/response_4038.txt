Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 4 different 3-stars in the given graph. The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (0, 5, 7)>
<3, (4, 5, 6)>
<4, (3, 5, 8)>
<5, (1, 2, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
