Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are 3-star subgraphs in the given graph. Let's find them.

The possible 3-stars in this graph are:
<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<0, (2, 3, 5)>
<0, (2, 5, 7)>
<2, (0, 3, 5)>
<3, (0, 2, 8)>
<4, (0, 6, None)>
<5, (0, 2, 6)>
<7, (0, 1, 2)>
<8, (2, 3, None)>
<9, (3, None, None)>

Therefore, there are a total of [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
