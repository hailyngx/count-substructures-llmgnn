Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph contains the following 3-stars:
[<0, (1, 4, 8)>, <1, (0, 4, 7)>, <4, (0, 1, 7)>, <7, (1, 4, 6)>] 
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
