Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in this graph is [9].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 7, 9)>
<2, (4, 8, 9)>
<4, (2, 6, 9)>
<6, (4, 7, 1)>
<7, (0, 6, 9)>
<9, (2, 5, 7)>
<1, (0, 7, 9)>
<8, (2, 4, 9)>
<5, (2, 9, 7)>
