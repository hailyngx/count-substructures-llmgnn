Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 5) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph.  
The 3-stars are:  
<1, (0, 3, 9)>  
<5, (4, 6, 7)>  

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
