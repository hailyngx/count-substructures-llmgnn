Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are as follows:
<0, (5, 6, 8)>
<1, (3, 5, 7)>
<2, (4, 9, 0)>
<3, (1, 1, 0)>
<4, (2, 6, 0)>
<5, (0, 1, 1)>
<6, (4, 4, 0)>
<7, (1, 8, 8)>
<8, (0, 7, 1)>
<9, (0, 1, 2)>

Therefore, there are [10] 3-stars in the graph.
