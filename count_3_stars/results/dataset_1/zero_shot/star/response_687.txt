Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 0) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The graph contains the following 3-star structures:

\[ <0, (5, 6, 8)> \]
\[ <1, (3, 4, 8)> \]
\[ <4, (1, 2, 5)> \]
\[ <8, (0, 2, 3)> \]
\[ <9, (0, 4, 8)> \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is: 

\[ [5] \]
