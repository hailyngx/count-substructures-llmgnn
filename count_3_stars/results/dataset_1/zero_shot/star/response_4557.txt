Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:

[<0, (3, 8, 0)>, <1, (2, 5, 7)>, <2, (1, 3, 9)>, <3, (0, 2, 8)>, <4, (3, 5, 4)>, <5, (1, 2, 9)>]

The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
