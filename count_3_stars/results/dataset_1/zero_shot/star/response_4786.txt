Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 6, 7)>
<1, (2, 7, 3)>
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<3, (4, 7, 8)>
<3, (7, 8, 9)>
<5, (8, 9, 3)>
