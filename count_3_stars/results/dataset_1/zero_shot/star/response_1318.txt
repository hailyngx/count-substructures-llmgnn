Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the graph is [24].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 5, 9)>
<1, (2, 5, -)>
<2, (0, 1, 4)>
<4, (2, 6, 9)>
<5, (0, 1, 6)>
<6, (4, 5, 7)>
<7, (6, 8, 9)>
<8, (5, 7, -)>
<9, (0, 3, 4)>
