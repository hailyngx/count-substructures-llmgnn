Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are 3-stars with the following configurations:
