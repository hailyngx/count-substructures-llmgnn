Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 7, 9)>
<1, (2, 4, 5)>
<2, (0, 1, 5)>
<4, (1, 5, 7)>
<5, (2, 4, 8)>
<7, (0, 4, 9)>
<9, (0, 4, 7)>
