Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The center nodes of the 3-stars can be any node with degree 3. Looking at the graph, we can see that nodes 1, 2, 3, 5, and 9 have a degree of 3. We will now identify the 3-stars:

<1, (2, 4, 5)>
<2, (0, 1, 9)>
<3, (1, 5, 7)>
<5, (1, 3, 7)>
<9, (0, 1, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
