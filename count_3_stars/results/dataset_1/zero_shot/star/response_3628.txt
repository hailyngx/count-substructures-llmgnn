Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:

[<0, (1, 6, 9)>, <1, (0, 4, 9)>, <3, (2, 6, 9)>, <4, (1, 5, 8)>, <5, (4, 7, 8)>, <6, (0, 3, 4)>, <8, (4, 5, 6)>, <9, (1, 3, 7)>]

There are a total of 8 unique 3-stars in this graph, so the final answer is [8].
