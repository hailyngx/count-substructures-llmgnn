Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) 

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are as follows:
- <0, (2, 6, 6)>
- <2, (0, 0, 6)>
- <6, (0, 2, 5)>
- <8, (3, 4, -)>

Since the 3-star graph <8, (3, 4, -)> does not have all edges present in the given graph, we will not count it. The count of unique 3-star graphs is therefore [3].
