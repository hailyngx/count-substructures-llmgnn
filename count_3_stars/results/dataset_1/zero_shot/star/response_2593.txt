Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 8) (4, 0) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are a total of [4] 3-star structures in the given graph. Here they are:

<0, (4, 7, 8)>
<1, (6, 9, 1)>
<3, (8, 0, 3)>
<6, (1, 9, 6)>
