Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
In this graph, the 3-star structures can be formed as follows:
- <0, (1, 2, 0)>
- <1, (0, 7, 8)>
- <2, (0, 3, 2)>
- <3, (2, 2, 3)>
- <4, (5, 5, 4)>
- <5, (4, 5, 5)>
- <6, (7, 7, 6)>
- <7, (1, 6, 8)>
- <8, (1, 7, 8)>
- <9, (7, 9, 7)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
