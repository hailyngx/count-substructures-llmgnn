Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are <0, (1, 2, 5)>, <1, (0, 6, 8)>, <2, (0, 3, 7)> 3-stars in the given graph. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
