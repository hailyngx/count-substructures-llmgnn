Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 3-stars in the given graph. The number of 3-stars is [3].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 5, 8)>
<2, (0, 5, 8)>
<7, (1, 8, 9)>
