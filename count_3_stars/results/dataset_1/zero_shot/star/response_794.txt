Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are a total of [7] 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<6, (0, 8, 9)>
<7, (0, 1, 9)>
<8, (0, 6, 9)>
<9, (0, 2, 6)>
<2, (9, 0, 0)>
