Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are <0, (5, 6, 7)>, <1, (2, 6, 0)>, <2, (1, 3, 5)>, <3, (2, 4, 6)>, <4, (3, 5, 9)>, <5, (0, 2, 4)>, <6, (0, 1, 3)>, <8, (3, 5, 6)>, <9, (4, 5, 8)> 3-stars in this graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
