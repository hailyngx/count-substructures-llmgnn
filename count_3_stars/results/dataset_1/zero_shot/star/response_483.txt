Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are as follows:
<0, (2, 4, 8)>
<1, (3, 6, 7)>
<5, (6, 8, 9)>
<9, (7, 8, 5)>
