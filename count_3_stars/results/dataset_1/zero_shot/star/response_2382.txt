Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
The given graph contains the following 3-stars:
[<0, (2, 6, 8)>, <1, (4, 6, 8)>, <2, (0, 7, 8)>, <4, (1, 5, 7)>] 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
