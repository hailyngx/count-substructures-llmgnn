Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in this graph is [5].  
The unique 3-stars are:  
<0, (3, 8, 9)>  
<1, (3, 7, 4)>  
<2, (5, 6, 0)>  
<3, (0, 1, 4)>  
<5, (2, 3, 6)>
