Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 5) 

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are:
<3, (5, 7, 8)>
<4, (6, 7, 5)>
<5, (3, 7, 8)>
<7, (3, 4, 5)>
<8, (0, 5, 7)>
Therefore, there are a total of [5] 3-stars in the graph.
