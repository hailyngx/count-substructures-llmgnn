Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 4) (9, 1) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:
```
0---2---4---8
|   |   |
5   6   7
    |
    1---3
        |
        9
```

In this graph, we observe the following 3-star structures:
1. <0, (2, 5, 6)>
2. <1, (3, 6, 9)>
  
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
