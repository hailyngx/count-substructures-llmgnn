Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
The graph can be visualized as follows:

```
    0---3
    |   |
8---7---9
|   |
|   6
|   |
2---5
```

Based on the definition of a 3-star graph, we are looking for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

1. <0, (3, 8, 9)>
2. <2, (5, 6, 9)>
3. <6, (2, 7, 9)>
4. <7, (6, 8, 0)>
5. <8, (0, 7, 9)>

Thus, there are 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph. This is represented as [5].
