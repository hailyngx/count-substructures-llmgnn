Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here is the list of the unique 3-stars found:

<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<1, (0, 2, 4)>
<2, (1, 3, 6)>
<3, (2, 6, 9)>
<4, (1, 2, 9)>
<5, (0, 9, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
