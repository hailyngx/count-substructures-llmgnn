Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The unique 3-stars in this graph are: 

<0, (3, 6, 9)>
<1, (4, 7, 9)>
<2, (8, 9, 3)>

There are a total of [3] 3-stars in the given graph.
