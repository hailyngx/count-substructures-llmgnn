Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of 10 nodes and 40 edges in the given graph. To count the number of 3-star configurations, we need to identify all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

The 3-star configurations in this graph are as follows:
<0, (1, 4, 7)>
<1, (0, 4, 5)>
<2, (0, 5, 9)>
<3, (6, 7, 9)>
<4, (0, 1, 5)>
<5, (1, 2, 4)>
<6, (3, 4, 8)>
<7, (0, 1, 3)>
<8, (4, 6, 9)>
<9, (0, 2, 4)>

Count = 10

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
