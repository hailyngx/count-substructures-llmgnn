Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of 5 3-stars in this graph. Here is a list of unique 3-stars found:

<0, (2, 3, 6)>
<1, (2, 5, 6)>
<2, (0, 1, 5)>
<4, (1, 3, 7)>
<9, (2, 5, 8)>

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
