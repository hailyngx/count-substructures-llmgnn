Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are [3] 3-star(s) in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (5, 6, 2)>
<6, (0, 2, 9)>
<9, (1, 2, 6)>
