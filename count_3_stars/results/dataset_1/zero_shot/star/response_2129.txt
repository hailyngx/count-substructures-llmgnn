Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are represented as follows:

[<0, (1, 2, 4)>, <1, (0, 5, 7)>, <7, (0, 1, 2)>, <5, (1, 4, 7)>]
