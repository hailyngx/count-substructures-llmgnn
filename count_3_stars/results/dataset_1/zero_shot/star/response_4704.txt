Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The center nodes in the 3-stars can be 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, or 8 given the graph information provided. Let's identify the 3-stars:

<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<4, (1, 7, 8)>
<5, (0, 1, 7)>
<6, (7, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 4, 5)>

Therefore, there are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The final answer is [6].
