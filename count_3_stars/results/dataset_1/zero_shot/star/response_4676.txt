Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are:

<0, (4, 6, 9)>
<1, (2, 3, 6)>
<3, (1, 4, 7)>
<6, (0, 2, 3)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
