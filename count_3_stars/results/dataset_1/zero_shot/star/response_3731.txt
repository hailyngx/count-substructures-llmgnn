Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.  
The unique 3-stars found are:  
<0, (2, 4, 5)>  
<2, (0, 1, 8)>  
<5, (0, 1, 9)>  
<8, (2, 3, 4)>
