Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 8, 0)>
<1, (2, 4, 9)>
<1, (4, 2, 6)>
<2, (1, 4, 6)>
<4, (1, 9, 4)>
<8, (0, 1, 7)>
<8, (4, 1, 7)>
<9, (1, 4, 9)>
