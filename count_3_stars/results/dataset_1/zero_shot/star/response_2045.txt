Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the answer is [5].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<1, (0, 4, 6)>
<3, (0, 4, 9)>
<4, (1, 3, 5)>
<5, (0, 4, 6)>
