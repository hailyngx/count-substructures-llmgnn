Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are 3-stars in the given graph, and the total count is [6].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 8, 9)>
<1, (2, 8, 9)>
<2, (1, 9, 8)>
<4, (0, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 1, 3)>
<9, (0, 2, 4)>
