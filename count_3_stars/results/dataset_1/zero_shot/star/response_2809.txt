Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
There are 8 unique 3-stars in this graph. 
Therefore, the answer is: [8]
The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 5, 9)>
<1, (0, 2, 4)>
<2, (1, 5, 8)>
<3, (0, 5, 0)>
<4, (1, 6, 7)>
<5, (0, 1, 2)>
<6, (0, 4, 7)>
<7, (4, 5, 7)>
