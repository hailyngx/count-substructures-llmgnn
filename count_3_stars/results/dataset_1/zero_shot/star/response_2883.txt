Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph can be calculated by finding nodes that have exactly three neighbors and then forming 3-stars using these nodes.

Nodes with 3 neighbors:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 6, and 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 6, and 7.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 7, and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, and 8.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 5, and 9.

Therefore, the 3-stars in the given graph are:
<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<2, (3, 6, 7)>
<5, (0, 4, 7)>
<6, (0, 1, 8)>
<7, (1, 2, 9)>

There are a total of 5 unique 3-stars in the graph: [5].
