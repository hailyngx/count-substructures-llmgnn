Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are two unique 3-stars in this graph. Here they are:

1. <0, (1, 4, 8)>
2. <1, (0, 6, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
