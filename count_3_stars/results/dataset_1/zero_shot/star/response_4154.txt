Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are a total of [4] 3-stars in the given graph. 
The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<1, (0, 4, 5)>
<5, (1, 3, 8)>
<8, (5, 6, 7)>
