Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (2, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph. 
The unique 3-stars are: 
<4, (2, 8, 9)>
<5, (1, 3, 8)>
<8, (4, 5, 9)>
<9, (4, 7, 8)>
