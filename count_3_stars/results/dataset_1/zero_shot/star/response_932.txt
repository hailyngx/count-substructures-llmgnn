Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are a total of [4] 3-stars in the given graph.  
The unique 3-stars are: <0, (2, 3, 4)>, <2, (0, 6, 8)>, <3, (0, 6, 7)>, and <7, (2, 3, 5)>.
