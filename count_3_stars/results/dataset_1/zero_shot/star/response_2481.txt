Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are:

[<0, (2, 1, 4)>, <1, (2, 4, 9)>, <2, (0, 1, 9)>, <4, (1, 2, 8)>, <5, (3, 9, 2)>, <6, (7, 8, 2)>, <7, (3, 6, 2)>, <8, (4, 6, 2)>, <9, (2, 4, 5)>]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
