Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are two 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (2, 7, 8)>
<2, (1, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
