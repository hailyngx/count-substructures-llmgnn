Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are: <<0, (5, 6, 8)>, <1, (4, 5, 9)>, <2, (6, 8, 9)>, <3, (4, 9, 5)>, <4, (1, 3, 5)>, <5, (0, 1, 7)>, <6, (0, 2, 7)>, <7, (5, 6, 8)>, <8, (0, 2, 7)>, <9, (2, 3, 5)>>.
There are a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
