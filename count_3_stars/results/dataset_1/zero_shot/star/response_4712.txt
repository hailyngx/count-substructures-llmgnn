Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are a total of 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are:
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<1, (3, 8, 9)>
<2, (3, 7, 9)>
<6, (4, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
