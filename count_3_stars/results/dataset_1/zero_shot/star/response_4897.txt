Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:
<1, (2, 5, 6)>
<2, (1, 5, 9)>
<3, (1, 7, 9)>
<5, (1, 2, 9)>
<6, (1, 7, 9)>
<7, (3, 6, 8)>
<8, (0, 7, 2)>
<9, (2, 3, 5)>

Therefore, there are a total of [8] 3-stars in this graph.
