Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The 3-stars in this graph are:

<0, (2, 8, 4)>
<1, (7, 3, 7)>
<2, (0, 8, 3)>
<3, (2, 4, 6)>
<4, (2, 6, 7)>
<5, (6, 9, 9)>
<6, (4, 5, 6)>
<7, (1, 3, 7)>
<8, (0, 2, 3)>
<9, (3, 4, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
