Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 3 unique 3-stars in the graph. They are:

1. <0, (3, 9, 4)>
2. <4, (3, 5, 8)>
3. <6, (1, 9, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
