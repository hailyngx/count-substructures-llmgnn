Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are a total of [12] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 6, 1)>
<1, (4, 6, 8)>
<2, (3, 6, 7)>
<3, (2, 6, 9)>
<4, (0, 1, 3)>
<5, (8, 6, -)>
<6, (0, 1, 2)>
<7, (1, 4, 2)>
<8, (1, 6, 5)>
<9, (2, 3, -)>
<*, (6, 1, 8)>
<*, (-, 6, 1)>
