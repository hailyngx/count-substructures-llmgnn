Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
There are <0, (6, 5, 7)>, <1, (2, 5, 9)>, <2, (1, 4, 5)>, <5, (1, 3, 6)> as the only 3-stars in the given graph. 
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
