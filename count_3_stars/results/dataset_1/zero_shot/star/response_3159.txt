Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are three unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are listed below along with the central node and the connected nodes:

<2, (4, 5, 6)>
<7, (0, 1, 2)>
<8, (1, 2, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
