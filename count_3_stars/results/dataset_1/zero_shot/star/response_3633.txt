Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are 5 unique 3-stars found in the given graph. The count of 3-stars is [5].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<0, (4, 3, 6)>
<0, (5, 1, 2)>
<0, (6, 3, 8)>
<1, (0, 2, 5)>
