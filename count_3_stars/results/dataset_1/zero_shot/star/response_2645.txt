Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here is the list of 3-stars and their center with leaves: 
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<1, (0, 5, 8)>
<4, (0, 7, 8)>
<5, (0, 1, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4].
