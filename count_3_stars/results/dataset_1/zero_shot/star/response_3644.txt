Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [10] nodes and [32] edges in the given graph. To count the number of 3-stars, we need to find the number of unique 3-stars present in the graph.

Based on the definition provided, a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Let's list the 3-stars present in the graph:
<0, (2, 8, 1)>
<1, (5, 6, 8)>
<2, (0, 3, 5)>
<3, (2, 4, 6)>
<4, (3, 5, 8)>
<5, (1, 2, 4)>
<6, (1, 3, 9)>
<7, (2, 9, 7)>
<8, (0, 1, 4)>
<9, (3, 6, 7)>

Since all 3-stars are unique in this graph, the total number of 3-stars is [10].
