Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are:

<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<0, (3, 6, 7)>
<2, (0, 3, 8)>
<2, (3, 4, 8)>
<3, (0, 2, 5)>
<4, (0, 2, 9)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
