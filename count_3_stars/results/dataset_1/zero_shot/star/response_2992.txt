Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (2, 8) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The 3-stars are:

<0, (1, 4, 8)>
<8, (2, 6, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
