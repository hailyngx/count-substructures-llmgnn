Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are 3-stars found in this given graph. The total number of 3-stars is [5].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 4, 8)>
<1, (2, 7, 8)>
<2, (1, 4, 6)>
<4, (0, 2, 9)>
<7, (1, 2, 6)>
