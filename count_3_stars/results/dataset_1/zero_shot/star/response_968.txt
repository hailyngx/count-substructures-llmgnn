Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 3-stars with the following unique central nodes and leaves:
<1, (4, 7, 5)>
<2, (4, 6, 8)> 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
