Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
    
    Unique 3-stars:
    <0, (1, 5, 6)>
    <1, (0, 2, 5)>
    <2, (1, 4, 8)>
    <5, (0, 2, 3)>
    <9, (3, 6, 8)>
