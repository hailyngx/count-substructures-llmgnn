Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
The list of unique 3-stars in the given graph is as follows:
<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<2, (4, 7, 7)>
<3, (1, 4, 5)>
<4, (1, 2, 3)>
<5, (3, 7, 7)>
<6, (0, 7, 8)>
<7, (0, 2, 5)>
<8, (6, 9, 9)>
<9, (8, 8, 8)>

Therefore, there are [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
