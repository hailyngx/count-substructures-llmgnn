Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the graph. The answer is [4].

The 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 5, 9)>
<1, (6, 8, 9)>
<2, (3, 7, 8)>
<8, (1, 2, 6)>
