Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<1, (3, 4, 7)>
<3, (1, 7, 8)>
<4, (0, 1, 5)>
<5, (0, 4, 6)>
<7, (0, 1, 3)>
