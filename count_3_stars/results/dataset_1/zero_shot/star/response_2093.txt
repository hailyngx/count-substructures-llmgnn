Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 4) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 5) 

Response:
There are 3 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

The 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 5, 7)>
<3, (0, 2, 5)>
<4, (1, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
