Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 4 total 3-star graphs in the given graph. Here are the unique 3-stars:

1. <1, (3, 6, 7)>
2. <2, (9, 5, _)>
3. <3, (1, 4, 7)>
4. <4, (3, 5, 6)>

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
