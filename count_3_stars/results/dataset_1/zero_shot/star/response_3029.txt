Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are [six] 3-stars in the given graph. Here is the list of unique 3-stars:
- <0, (4, 5, 6)>
- <1, (8, 2, 3)>
- <2, (4, 1, 5)>
- <3, (1, 9, 6)>
- <4, (0, 2, 6)>
- <5, (0, 7, 8)>
