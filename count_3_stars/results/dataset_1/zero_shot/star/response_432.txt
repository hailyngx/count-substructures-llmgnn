Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 8, 9)>
<2, (0, 8, 9)>
<3, (2, 9, 5)>
<4, (1, 5, 7)>
<5, (1, 4, 9)>
<9, (0, 2, 8)>
