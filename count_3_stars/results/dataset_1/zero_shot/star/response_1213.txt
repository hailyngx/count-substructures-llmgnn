Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of [4] 3-stars in the given graph.

<0, (7, 8, 3)>
<3, (4, 5, 8)>
<4, (3, 6, 8)>
<8, (0, 3, 5)>
