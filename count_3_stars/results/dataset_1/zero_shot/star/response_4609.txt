Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-star structures:
- <0, (2, 5, 8)>
- <3, (0, 5, 6)>
- <6, (3, 7, 9)>
- <7, (1, 6, 8)>
- <8, (0, 2, 7)>
- <9, (4, 6, 7)>

Counting the number of 3-stars in the graph, we have a total of [6].
