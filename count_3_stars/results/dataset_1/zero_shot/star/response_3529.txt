Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) 

Response:
There are a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph. Here are the unique 3-stars found:

<0, (3, 9, 6)>
<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<2, (1, 4, 8)>
<3, (0, 1, 6)>
<4, (1, 2, 8)>
<8, (2, 3, 6)>
