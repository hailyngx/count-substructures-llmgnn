Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are:
[<1, (0, 9, 9)>]
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1].
