Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

They are:
<1, (2, 3, 4)>
<3, (1, 5, 7)>
<4, (1, 5, 6)>
<5, (2, 3, 4)>

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
