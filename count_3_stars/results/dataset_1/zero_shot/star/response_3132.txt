Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of 3-star subgraphs in the given graph can be calculated as follows:

1. Identify the nodes with degree 3 in the graph.
2. For each node with degree 3, count the number of unique 3-star configurations that can be formed with that node as the center.

Let's go through the calculations:

In the given graph, the nodes with degree 3 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8.

For Node 1:
Possible 3-star configurations with Node 1 as the center:
- <1, (2, 3, 5)>
- <1, (2, 6, 8)>
Total = 2

For Node 2:
Possible 3-star configurations with Node 2 as the center:
- <2, (1, 3, 6)>
- <2, (1, 4, 7)>
Total = 2

For Node 3:
Possible 3-star configurations with Node 3 as the center:
- <3, (1, 2, 8)>
Total = 1

For Node 4:
Possible 3-star configurations with Node 4 as the center:
- <4, (0, 2, 5)>
- <4, (1, 5, 8)>
- <4, (2, 5, 9)>
Total = 3

For Node 5:
Possible 3-star configurations with Node 5 as the center:
- <5, (0, 4, 7)>
Total = 1

For Node 8:
Possible 3-star configurations with Node 8 as the center:
- <8, (1, 3, 4)>
- <8, (1, 4, 9)>
Total = 2

Total number of 3-star subgraphs = 2 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 2 = 11

Therefore, the final answer is [11].
