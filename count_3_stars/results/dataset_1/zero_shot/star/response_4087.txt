Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (5, 3) (5, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in this graph, so the final answer is [4].

The unique 3-stars are:
<2, (3, 5, 7)>
<2, (7, 8, 9)>
<7, (2, 5, 8)>
<9, (1, 2, 9)>
