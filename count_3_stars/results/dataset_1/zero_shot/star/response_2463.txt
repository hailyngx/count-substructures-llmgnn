Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be found by identifying nodes that form 3-stars. Since a 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can look for nodes with three neighbors. Let's list the 3-stars present in the graph:

1. <0, (1, 4, 7)>
2. <1, (0, 4, 5)>
3. <4, (0, 1, 7)>
4. <7, (0, 4, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
