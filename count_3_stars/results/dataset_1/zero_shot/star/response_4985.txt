Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are three unique 3-stars in the given graph. The final answer is [3].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (7, 9, 3)>
<1, (3, 5, 6)>
<6, (2, 5, 9)>
