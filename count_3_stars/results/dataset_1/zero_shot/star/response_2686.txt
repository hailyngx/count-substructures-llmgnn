Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are:
<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<0, (2, 3, 8)>
<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<0, (4, 5, 9)>
<0, (5, 6, 9)>
<1, (0, 8, 2)>
<2, (0, 3, 8)>
<3, (2, 5, 8)>
<3, (2, 8, 9)>
<4, (0, 6, 9)>
<5, (0, 3, 6)>
<5, (0, 6, 8)>
<5, (3, 6, 8)>
<6, (0, 4, 9)>
<6, (4, 5, 9)>
<8, (1, 2, 3)>
<9, (3, 4, 6)>

Therefore, there are [18] 3-star graphs in the given graph.
