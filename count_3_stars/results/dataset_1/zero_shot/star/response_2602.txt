Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 3 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are:
<0, (2, 3, 5)>
<1, (4, 6, 7)>
<6, (0, 1, 7)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
