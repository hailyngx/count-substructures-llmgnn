Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.  
The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 3, 5)>
<2, (0, 3, 4)>
<4, (2, 8, 9)>
<8, (4, 5, 6)>
