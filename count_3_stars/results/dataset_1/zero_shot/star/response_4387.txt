Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the provided graph.
