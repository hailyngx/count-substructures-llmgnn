Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are [0] 3-stars in the given graph. 

Since a 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes, and all the nodes in the given graph have degrees that exceed 3, there are no 3-stars present.
