Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [2] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (7, 8, 9)>
<9, (0, 8, 5)>
