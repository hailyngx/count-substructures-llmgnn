Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (0, 6, 9)>
<2, (1, 4, 9)>
<3, (2, 4, 9)>
<4, (4, 7, 9)>
<5, (5, 6, 8)>
<6, (7, 4, 9)>
