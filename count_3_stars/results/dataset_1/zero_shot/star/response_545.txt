Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are [3] 3-stars in the given graph.  
The unique 3-stars are: <0, (4, 5, 9)>, <1, (2, 5, 6)>, <5, (0, 1, 6)>.
