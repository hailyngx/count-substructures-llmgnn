Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are 3 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 3, 7)>
<1, (0, 2, 4)>
<4, (1, 2, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
