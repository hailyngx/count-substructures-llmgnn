Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:
- <0, (2, 5, 7)>
- <0, (3, 5, 7)>
- <0, (5, 7, 9)>
- <2, (0, 6, 9)>
- <3, (0, 1, 4)>
- <3, (1, 4, 8)>
- <3, (4, 6, 8)>
- <4, (3, 6, 9)>
- <5, (0, 7, 9)>
- <6, (2, 3, 4)>
- <8, (1, 3, 6)>
- <9, (0, 5, 7)>
- <9, (2, 4, 7)>
- <9, (4, 5, 7)>

There are 14 unique 3-stars in the given graph, so the final answer is [14].
