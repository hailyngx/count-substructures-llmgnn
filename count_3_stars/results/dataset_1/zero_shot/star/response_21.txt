Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:   
[<0, (7, 8, 1)>, <1, (4, 8, 0)>]  
  
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
