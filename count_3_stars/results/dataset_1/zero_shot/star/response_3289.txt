Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [10] total nodes and [32] edges in the given graph.

The 3-stars in the graph are:
<0, (1, 7, 8)>
<1, (0, 2, 5)>
<2, (1, 6, 7)>
<4, (6, 8, 9)>
<5, (1, 9, 7)>
<6, (2, 4, 7)>
<7, (0, 1, 2)>
<8, (0, 4, 7)>
<9, (5, 7, 8)>

Therefore, there are [9] 3-stars in the graph.
