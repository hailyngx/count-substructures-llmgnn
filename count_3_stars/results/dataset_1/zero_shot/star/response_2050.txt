Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph contains the following 3-stars:
[<0, (1, 2, 6)>, <2, (0, 3, 9)>, <3, (2, 9, 5)>, <7, (4, 9, 7)>]
