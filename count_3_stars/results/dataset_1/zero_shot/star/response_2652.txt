Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in this graph is [2].

The two unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (9, 1, 9)>
<2, (3, 2, 6)>
