Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph can be identified by finding the nodes which are connected to exactly three other nodes. Below are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

1. <0, (1, 6, 9)>
2. <1, (0, 7, 9)>
3. <2, (4, 5, 7)>
4. <3, (4, 7, 9)>
5. <4, (2, 3, 6)>
6. <5, (2, 9, _)>
7. <6, (0, 1, 4)>
8. <7, (1, 2, 3)>
9. <8, (2, 6, 9)>
10. <9, (1, 3, 5)>

Count of 3-stars: [10]
