Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 3 unique 3-stars in this graph. Here they are:

<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<1, (0, 5, 6)>
<4, (0, 3, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
