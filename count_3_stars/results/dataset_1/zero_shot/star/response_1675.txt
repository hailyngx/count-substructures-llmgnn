Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 7, 8)>
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<1, (0, 4, 6)>
<4, (1, 2, 3)>
<4, (1, 6, 2)>
<7, (0, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 6, 7)>
<9, (5, 7, 9)>
