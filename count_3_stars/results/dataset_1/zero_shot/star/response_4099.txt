Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The center node is connected to 3 nodes in a 3-star pattern. Let's identify all the unique 3-stars and count them.

1. <0, (1, 3, 8)>
2. <1, (0, 2, 8)>
3. <2, (1, 3, 6)>
4. <3, (0, 2, 4)>
5. <4, (3, 5, 8)>
6. <5, (4, 6, 8)>
7. <6, (2, 5, 9)>
8. <7, (3, 8, 9)>
9. <8, (1, 3, 4)>
10. <9, (5, 6, 7)>

There are 10 unique 3-stars in this graph. So, the answer is [10].
