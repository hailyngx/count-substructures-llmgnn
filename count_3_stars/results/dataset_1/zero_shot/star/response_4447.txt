Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
The central nodes of each 3-star can be found by identifying nodes with exactly 3 incident edges. Let's start by listing the central nodes:

Central nodes:
- Node 0
- Node 2
- Node 3
- Node 6
- Node 8

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (1, 2, 8)>
<2, (0, 6, 8)>
<3, (2, 6, 8)>
<6, (2, 5, 9)>
<8, (0, 3, 5)> 

Count of 3-stars: [5]
