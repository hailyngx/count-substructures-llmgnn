Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in this graph can be calculated by examining each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

From the given edges, we can identify the following 3-star configurations:
<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<2, (0, 1, 6)>
<3, (0, 2, 8)>
<4, (0, 1, 6)>
<6, (2, 4, 7)>
<7, (0, 6, 8)>
<8, (0, 1, 2)>
<p>
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
