Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:
[<0, (2, 4, 5)>, <1, (2, 9, 7)>, <2, (0, 1, 3)>, <3, (2, 4, 6)>, <4, (0, 3, 8)>, <5, (2, 3, 6)>, <6, (2, 3, 5)>, <7, (2, 9, 7)>, <8, (4, 5, 6)>, <9, (1, 3, 7)>]
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
