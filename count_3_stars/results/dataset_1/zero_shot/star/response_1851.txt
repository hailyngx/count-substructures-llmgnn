Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 6, 7)>
<1, (2, 3, 5)>
<1, (1, 7, 9)>
<2, (0, 1, 5)>
<2, (1, 2, 9)>
<3, (1, 4, 5)>
<4, (2, 3, 5)>
<5, (1, 2, 9)>
