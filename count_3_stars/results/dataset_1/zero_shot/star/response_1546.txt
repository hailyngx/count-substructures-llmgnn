Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 8 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The 3-stars are as follows: 

1. <0, (2, 3, 4)>
2. <2, (0, 1, 7)>
3. <3, (0, 1, 5)>
4. <4, (0, 5, 6)>
5. <5, (3, 4, 7)>
6. <6, (3, 4, 7)>
7. <7, (2, 4, 5)>
8. <8, (0, 2, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
