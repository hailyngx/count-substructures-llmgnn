Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in this graph. The 3-stars are as follows: 
<0, (6, 7, 8)>
<1, (2, 3, 7)>
<2, (1, 4, 9)>
<7, (0, 5, 8)>
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
