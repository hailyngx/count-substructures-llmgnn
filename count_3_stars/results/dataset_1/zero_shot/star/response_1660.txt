Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:
[<0, (5, 1, 3)>, <1, (2, 5, 7)>]
There are 2 total 3-stars in the graph, which can be represented as [<0, (5, 1, 3)>, <1, (2, 5, 7)>].
