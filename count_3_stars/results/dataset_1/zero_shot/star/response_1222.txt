Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-star structures in the given graph. Each 3-star is shown below:

<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<0, (2, 7, 8)>
<0, (2, 8, 9)>
<4, (8, 5, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
