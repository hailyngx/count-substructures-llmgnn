Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 0) (3, 6) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph contains the following 3-stars:
- <0, (2, 6, 7)>
- <4, (6, 8, 9)>
- <5, (1, 9, 0)>
- <6, (3, 0, 4)>
- <9, (8, 5, 4)>
- <8, (4, 9, 0)>
 
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
