Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are listed inside <>:

<0, (2, 5, 8)>
<2, (0, 5, 6)>
<4, (3, 5, 6)>
<5, (0, 1, 2)> 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4].
