Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<1, (3, 5, 6)>
<4, (0, 6, 8)>
<5, (0, 1, 7)>
