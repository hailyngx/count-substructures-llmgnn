Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are:

<0, (4, 5, 9)>
<2, (4, 6, 9)>
<3, (4, 5, 7)>
<4, (0, 2, 3)>

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
