Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (3, 6, 7)>
<1, (3, 6, 8)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<6, (0, 1, 2)>
<8, (1, 4, 7)>
