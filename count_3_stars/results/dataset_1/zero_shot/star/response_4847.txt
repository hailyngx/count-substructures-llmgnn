Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here are the 3-stars listed inside <>:

<0, (3, 5, 1)>
<1, (3, 6, 9)>
<2, (5, 6, 7)>
<8, (3, 4, 6)>

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
