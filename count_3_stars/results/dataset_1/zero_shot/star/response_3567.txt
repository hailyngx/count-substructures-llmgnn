Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

```
0 -- 2 -- 4
|       |  |
3       6  9
|       | /
5 -- 1 -- 8
       |
       7
```

To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to find all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star-like way. Let's list the unique 3-stars found:

<0, (2, 3, 5)>
<2, (0, 4, 6)>
<4, (2, 6, 8)>
<6, (2, 4, 8)>
<8, (4, 6, 9)>
<1, (5, 8, 9)>

There are a total of 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph, thus the final answer is [6].
