Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Thus, the output should be as follows:

\[6\]

The unique 3-stars are as follows:
<0, (3, 5, 9)>
<1, (3, 8, 4)>
<2, (3, 9, 5)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<6, (7, 8, 9)>
<7, (6, 9, 8)>
