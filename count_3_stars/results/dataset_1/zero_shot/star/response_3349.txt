Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<2, (0, 7, 9)>
<3, (5, 6, 7)>
<6, (1, 3, 8)>
<7, (2, 3, 9)>
<9, (2, 3, 7)>
