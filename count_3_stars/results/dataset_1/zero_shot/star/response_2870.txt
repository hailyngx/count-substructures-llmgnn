Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:
      
    0 --- 1 --- 2
    |    /|\    |
    |   / | \   |
    |  /  |  \  |
    | /   |   \ |
    3 --- 4    8
     \   /     
      \ /      
       5       
        |
        6
        |
        7
       / \
      9   6
       
Based on the provided information, we can see that the center node 0 has exactly three neighbors: nodes 1, 3, and 5. Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is 1.

Thus, the final answer is [1], and the unique 3-star found is <0, (1, 3, 5)>.
