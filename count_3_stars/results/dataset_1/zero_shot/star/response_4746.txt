Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 1) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Hence, the answer is [4].
The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (2, 5, 7)>
<1, (3, 7, 9)>
<5, (0, 8, 9)>
<7, (0, 1, 4)>
