Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are [2] 3-stars in the given graph. The unique 3-stars are <0, (3, 5, 7)> and <1, (6, 8, 9)>.
