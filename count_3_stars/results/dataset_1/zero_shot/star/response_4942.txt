Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
There are 6 3-stars in the given graph. <0, (2, 6, 8)>, <1, (3, 4, 5)>, <2, (0, 6, 9)>, <3, (1, 6, 8)>, <5, (1, 8, 5)>, <8, (0, 3, 5)>. Therefore, the final answer is [6].
