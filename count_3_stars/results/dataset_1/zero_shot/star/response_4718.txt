Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:

[<0, (2, 3, 8)>, <1, (5, 3, 6)>, <2, (3, 8, 0)>]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
