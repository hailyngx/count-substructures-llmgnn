Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) 

Response:
The given graph contains the following 3-stars:
[<1, (4, 7, 8)>, <2, (6, 7, 8)>, <3, (4, 5, 7)>]  
There are a total of 3 unique 3-stars in the graph.  
Therefore, the final answer is [3].
