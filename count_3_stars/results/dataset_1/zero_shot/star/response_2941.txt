Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here are the 3-stars listed inside <>:
  
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<1, (2, 5, 6)>
<2, (1, 3, 8)>
<6, (1, 4, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
