Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are a total of 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The 3-stars are as follows:

<3, (4, 5, 6)>
<4, (0, 2, 3)>
<6, (3, 7, 9)>
<9, (1, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
