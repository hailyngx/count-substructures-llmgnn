Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 2) (9, 1) 

Response:
There are 3 unique 3-stars in the given graph, and they are:

<0, (3, 5, 7)>
<1, (4, 7, 9)>
<2, (8, 4, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
