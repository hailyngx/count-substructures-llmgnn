Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (2, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 8) (4, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are [3] 3-stars in the given graph.  
The unique 3-stars found are:  
<0, (1, 2, 6)>  
<3, (6, 8, 9)>  
<4, (8, 9, 3)>
