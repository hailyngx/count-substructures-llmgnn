Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 7, 8)>
<3, (1, 2, 7)>
<4, (7, 5, 8)>
<5, (6, 7, 9)>
<6, (5, 8, 9)>
