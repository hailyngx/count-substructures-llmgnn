Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 2 three star graphs in the given graph. The unique 3-stars found are:

<0, (2, 4, 7)>
<8, (2, 5, 9)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
