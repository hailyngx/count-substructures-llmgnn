Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The 3-stars are:

<0, (9, 5, 1)>
<1, (8, 4, 2)>
<2, (5, 6, 4)>
<6, (8, 7, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
