Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 2) 

Response:
There are 5 unique 3-stars in this graph. The answer is [5].
The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<1, (0, 7, 4)>
<2, (3, 4, 6)>
<4, (0, 2, 6)>
<6, (0, 2, 4)>
