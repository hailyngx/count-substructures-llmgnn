Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the final answer is [4].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<2, (0, 5, 6)>
<6, (1, 2, 9)>
<7, (0, 1, 9)>
