Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph. 

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (3, 5, 8)>
<2, (3, 9, 6)>
<5, (0, 6, 9)>
<6, (5, 8, 9)>
<7, (1, 2, 9)>
<1, (7, 2, 3)>
