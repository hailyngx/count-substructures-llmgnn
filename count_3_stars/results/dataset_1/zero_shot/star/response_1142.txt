Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<1, (7, 9, -)>
<2, (0, 5, 9)>
<3, (4, 5, 8)>
<4, (0, 3, 8)>
<5, (0, 2, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
