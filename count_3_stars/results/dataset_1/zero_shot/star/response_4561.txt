Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (4, 6, 9)>
<3, (5, 8, 9)>
<4, (0, 6, 8)>
<5, (3, 8, 9)>
<6, (0, 2, 8)>
<8, (1, 3, 9)>
