Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].  
The unique 3-stars are:  
<0, (1, 5, 9)>  
<1, (0, 2, 9)>  
<2, (1, 8, 9)>  
<9, (0, 1, 2)>
