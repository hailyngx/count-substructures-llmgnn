Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The central nodes in a 3-star graph must have exactly 3 edges connected to them. Let's go through the nodes and identify the central nodes along with their neighboring nodes to form the 3-stars.

Central nodes with 3 edges:
1. Node 3: (1, 3, 7), (2, 3, 9), (4, 3, 5), (5, 3, 8)
2. Node 8: (0, 8, 2), (2, 8, 9), (3, 8, 5), (7, 8, 6)
   
There are 3-stars from the above configurations. Let's list them:
<3, (1, 7, 3)>
<3, (2, 9, 3)>
<3, (4, 5, 3)>
<3, (5, 8, 3)>
<8, (0, 2, 8)>
<8, (2, 9, 8)>
<8, (5, 3, 8)>
<8, (7, 6, 8)>

Count of 3-stars: [8]
