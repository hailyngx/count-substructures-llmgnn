Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 3-stars in the given graph, which can be listed as follows:

[<2, (3, 5, 7)>, <3, (2, 4, 7)>, <5, (1, 2, 9)>, <8, (3, 6, 9)>]
