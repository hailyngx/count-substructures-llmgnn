Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 2) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 1) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 3, 6)>
<1, (3, 5, 6)>
<1, (3, 7, 8)>
<2, (0, 4, 7)>
