Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
There are [2] 3-stars in the given graph.
The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (5, 8, 7)>
<1, (2, 6, 7)>
