Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (9, 2) 

Response:
There are [8] 3-stars in the given graph.  

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (4, 6, 7)>
<2, (4, 5, 7)>
<2, (5, 7, 9)>
<4, (0, 2, 7)>
<4, (2, 7, 9)>
<5, (2, 7, 9)>
<6, (0, 7, 9)>
<7, (0, 2, 4)>
