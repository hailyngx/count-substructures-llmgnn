Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The central node of a 3-star must be connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through each node to see if it satisfies this condition:

- Node 0 is connected to 2 nodes, not 3.
- Node 1 is connected to 3 nodes (3, 5, 7) forming the 3-star <1, (3, 5, 7)>.
- Node 2 is connected to 2 nodes, not 3.
- Node 3 is connected to 3 nodes (1, 7, 9) forming the 3-star <3, (1, 7, 9)>.
- Node 4 is connected to 3 nodes (5, 7, 9) forming the 3-star <4, (5, 7, 9)>.
- Node 5 is already part of the 3-stars found with nodes 1 and 4.
- Node 6 is connected to 2 nodes, not 3.
- Node 7 is already part of the 3-stars found with nodes 1 and 4.
- Node 8 is connected to 1 node, not 3.
- Node 9 is connected to 3 nodes (0, 2, 4) forming the 3-star <9, (0, 2, 4)>.

Therefore, we have found a total of 3 unique 3-stars in the given graph, which are <1, (3, 5, 7)>, <3, (1, 7, 9)>, and <9, (0, 2, 4)>. So, the final answer is [3].
