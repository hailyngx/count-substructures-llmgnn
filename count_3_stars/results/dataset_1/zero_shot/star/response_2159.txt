Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The answer is [4]. 
The 3-stars are: <0, (2, 4, 5)>, <2, (0, 5, 9)>, <3, (2, 5, 8)>, <6, (1, 4, 2)>.
