Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 6, 9)>
<0, (2, 6, 9)>
<0, (6, 7, 8)>
<3, (2, 5, 6)>
<3, (5, 6, 7)>
<7, (4, 5, 8)>
