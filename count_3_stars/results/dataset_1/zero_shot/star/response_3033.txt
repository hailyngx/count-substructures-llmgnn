Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 1) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 3-star subgraphs in the given graph. Here is the list of unique 3-stars found:
  
  1. <1, (4, 5, 6)>
  
There is only one unique 3-star found in this graph, so the final answer is [1].
