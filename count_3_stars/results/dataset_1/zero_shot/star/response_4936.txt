Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are: <0, (4, 6, 9)>, <2, (1, 9, 0)>, <6, (0, 3, 4)>, and <9, (0, 2, 6)>.
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
