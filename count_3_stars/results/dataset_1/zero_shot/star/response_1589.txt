Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph.  
The 3-stars are:  
<0, (2, 5, 6)>  
<0, (3, 6, 9)>  
<2, (0, 4, 6)>  
<6, (0, 3, 7)>  
<8, (1, 9, 8)>  

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
