Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 5, 7)>
<0, (3, 4, 7)>
<0, (5, 2, 4)>
<0, (7, 4, 5)>
<2, (0, 5, 9)>
<3, (0, 4, 9)>
<4, (3, 5, 7)>
