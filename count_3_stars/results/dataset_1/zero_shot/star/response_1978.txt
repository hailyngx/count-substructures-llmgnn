Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are [8] 3-stars in the given graph.

<0, (2, 3, 7)>
<1, (4, 5, 7)>
<3, (0, 4, 7)>
<5, (1, 7, 9)>
<7, (0, 1, 3)>
<9, (3, 5, -)>
<2, (0, -, -)>
<4, (1, 3, -)>
