Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph.  

The unique 3-stars are as follows:
<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<0, (2, 6, 9)>
<0, (4, 6, 8)>
<1, (3, 7, 5)>
<3, (1, 9, 7)>
<9, (2, 0, 3)>
