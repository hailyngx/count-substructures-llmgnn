Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

The 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 2, 4)>  
<1, (0, 4, 6)>  
<2, (0, 4, 7)>  
<3, (4, 5, 7)>  

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
