Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated by identifying the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes and considering each of them as the center of a 3-star.

Let's iterate through each node and check if it is connected to exactly three other nodes. If so, we will list the 3-star.
Here are the identified 3-stars:
<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<1, (0, 3, 9)>
<3, (0, 1, 5)>
<5, (0, 3, 9)>
<7, (0, 2, 8)>
<8, (0, 2, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
