Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
The graph contains the following 3-stars:
[<0, (3, 7, 1)>, <2, (6, 8, 9)>, <4, (7, 9, 5)>] 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
