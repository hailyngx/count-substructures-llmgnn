Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be calculated by counting the number of unique 3-stars based on the provided edge list.

The unique 3-stars in the given graph are:
<2, (4, 6, 8)>
<3, (7, 9, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
