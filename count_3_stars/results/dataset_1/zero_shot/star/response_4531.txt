Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are [2] 3-stars in the given graph.  
The unique 3-stars are:  
<2, (0, 4, 5)>  
<4, (2, 6, 9)>
