Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:
- <1, (3, 6, 7)>
- <1, (3, 8, 9)>
- <4, (1, 6, 7)>
- <9, (1, 8, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
