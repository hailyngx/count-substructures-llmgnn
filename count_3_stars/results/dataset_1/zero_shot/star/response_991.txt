Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 3-star structures in the given graph. Let's identify them:

1. <0, (1, 6, 8)>
2. <0, (1, 8, 9)>
3. <3, (2, 5, 7)>
4. <3, (2, 7, 8)>
5. <3, (5, 7, 9)>
6. <3, (7, 4, 5)>
7. <3, (7, 2, 3)>
8. <3, (7, 3, 5)>
9. <3, (7, 3, 8)>
10. <9, (0, 4, 5)>
11. <9, (0, 8, 9)>
12. <4, (7, 9, 5)>
13. <4, (9, 0, 5)>

Therefore, there are 13 3-stars in the given graph. The final answer is [13].
