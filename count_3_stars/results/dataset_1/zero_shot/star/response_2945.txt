Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [8] 3-stars in the given graph. 
The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 5, 7)>, <0, (7, 8, 9)>, <1, (2, 3, 6)>, <1, (3, 7, 9)>, <3, (1, 4, 5)>, <4, (3, 7, 8)>, <5, (0, 2, 9)>, <9, (1, 5, 8)>
