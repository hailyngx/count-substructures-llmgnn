Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4].

<0, (1, 6, 8)>
<0, (2, 3, 9)>
<0, (3, 6, 9)>
<3, (0, 6, 9)>
