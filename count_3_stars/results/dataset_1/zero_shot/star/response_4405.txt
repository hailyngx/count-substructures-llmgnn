Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be counted based on the number of nodes connected to node 0, node 1, and node 3. 

By visually analyzing the provided graph, we can identify the following unique 3-stars:
- <0, (4, 7, 9)>
- <1, (3, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the final answer is [2].
