Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph contains multiple 3-stars. To determine the count of 3-stars, we will list all the unique 3-stars. Here they are:

<1, (2, 5, 8)>
<2, (1, 4, 5)>
<5, (1, 2, 9)>
<6, (0, 2, 5)>
<7, (2, 8, 9)>

Therefore, there are a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
