Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are two 3-stars in the given graph. The unique 3-stars are as follows:
<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<4, (1, 7, 5)>
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
