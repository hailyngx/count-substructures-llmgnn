Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are 3 unique 3-stars in this graph. Here they are:

<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<4, (0, 3, 8)>
<7, (0, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
