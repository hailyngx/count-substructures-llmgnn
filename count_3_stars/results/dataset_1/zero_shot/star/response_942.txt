Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].  
The unique 3-stars found are:  
<0, (8, 5, 6)>  
<1, (3, 4, 7)>  
<8, (0, 5, 6)>
