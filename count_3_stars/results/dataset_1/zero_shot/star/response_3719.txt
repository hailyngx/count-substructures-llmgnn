Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph, and the count should be represented as follows: 

\[6\] 

The unique 3-stars are as follows: 

<0, (5, 6, 8)>  
<1, (2, 9, 6)>  
<2, (1, 4, 5)>  
<4, (2, 6, 7)>  
<5, (0, 2, 7)>  
<6, (0, 4, 9)>
