Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 5) (9, 4) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<4, (1, 3, 9)>
<5, (3, 7, 7)>
