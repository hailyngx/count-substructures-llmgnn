Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. To find the number of 3-stars, we need to identify the sets of nodes that form 3-stars. 

By definition, a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

1. <0, (2, 3, 4)>
2. <0, (2, 4, 5)>
3. <0, (3, 4, 5)>
4. <3, (0, 6, 8)>
5. <4, (1, 0, 5)>
6. <4, (1, 5, 8)>
7. <8, (3, 4, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
