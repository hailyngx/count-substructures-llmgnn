Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (5, 1, 8)>
<1, (5, 0, 8)>
<2, (5, 4, 9)>
<4, (2, 5, 9)>
<5, (0, 1, 2)>
<8, (1, 5, 7)>
<9, (2, 4, 7)>
<9, (6, 7, 4)>
