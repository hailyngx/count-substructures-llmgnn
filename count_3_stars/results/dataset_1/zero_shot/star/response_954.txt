Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are two 3-stars in the given graph. 
The unique 3-stars are <0, (3, 7, 8)> and <4, (7, 8, 9)>.
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
