Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 2) 

Response:
The total number of 3-star subgraphs can be counted by checking each node in the graph to see how many 3-star configurations it participates in. Since each 3-star consists of a center node connected to three other nodes, we need to find nodes that are connected to exactly 3 other nodes.

In this graph:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 7.
- Node 1 is connected to node 6.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 8, 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 5, 8.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 6, 7.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 6.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 5.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 4.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 3.
- Node 9 is connected to node 2.

Therefore, node 2 is the only node connected to exactly 3 other nodes, making it the only center of a 3-star graph in the given graph.

Hence, the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [1]. 

The unique 3-star is <2, (4, 5, 8)>.
