Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [3] 3-stars in the given graph. 
The unique 3-stars are <0, (8, 9)>, <1, (2, 4, 6)>, and <3, (2, 6, 9)>.
