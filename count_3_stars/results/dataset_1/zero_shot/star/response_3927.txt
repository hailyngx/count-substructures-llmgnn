Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 3-star graphs in the given graph, and they are as follows:
<0, (6, 7, 1)>
<3, (5, 6, 7)>
<4, (6, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
