Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be computed by counting the number of unique 3-stars.

The unique 3-stars in the graph are:
<0, (2, 4, 9)>
<1, (7, 8, 9)>
<2, (0, 3, 5)>
<3, (2, 4, -)>
<4, (0, 2, 5)>
<5, (2, 4, 7)>
<7, (1, 4, 5)>
<8, (1, 2, 5)>
<9, (0, 1, 7)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
