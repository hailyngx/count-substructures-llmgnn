Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

The 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 7, 8)>
<3, (0, 2, 7)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
