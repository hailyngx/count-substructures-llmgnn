Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
There are a total of 3 stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<1, (3, 6, 7)>
<4, (0, 5, 6)>

Therefore, the final answer is [3].
