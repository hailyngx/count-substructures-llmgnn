Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are:
<0, (2, 6, 8)>
<1, (2, 9, -)>
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<3, (2, 8, -)>
<4, (5, 6, -)>
<5, (4, 6, 8)>
<6, (0, 4, 5)>
<8, (0, 3, 5)>
<9, (1, -, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
