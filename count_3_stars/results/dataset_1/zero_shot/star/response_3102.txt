Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 2 unique 3-star structures in this graph. The count of 3-stars is [2].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 6, 9)>
<5, (6, 7, 8)>
