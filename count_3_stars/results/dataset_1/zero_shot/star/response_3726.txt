Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
The 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<1, (2, 3, 5)>
<2, (0, 1, 6)>
<6, (2, 4, 7)>
Therefore, the final answer is [4].
