Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].  

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:  
<0, (1, 7, 8)>  
<8, (0, 2, 9)>
