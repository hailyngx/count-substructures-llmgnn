Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be calculated by counting the number of times a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's identify the 3-stars present in the graph:

1. <0, (1, 4, 5)>
2. <1, (0, 4, 8)>
3. <4, (0, 1, 2)>
4. <5, (0, 6, 7)>
5. <6, (3, 4, 5)>
6. <7, (5, 6, 8)>
7. <8, (1, 3, 7)>
8. <9, (4, 5, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
