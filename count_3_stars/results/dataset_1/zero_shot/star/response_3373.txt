Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in this graph. The 3-stars are:

<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<1, (4, 9, 5)>
<3, (4, 8, 9)>
<4, (0, 1, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [4].
