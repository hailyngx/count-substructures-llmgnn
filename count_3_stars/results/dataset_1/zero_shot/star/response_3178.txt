Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:  

```
0 --- 5     8  
|         /   
|        /    
8     1 
|        
3 --- 6    
|        
|        
9 --- 7  
```

The 3-stars in the graph are as follows:
[<0, (5, 8, 1)>, <3, (5, 6, 8)>]  

Thus, the final answer is [2].
