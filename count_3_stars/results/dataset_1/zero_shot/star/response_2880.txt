Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are a total of [3] 3-stars in the given graph.  

The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (3, 5, 8)>
<5, (1, 3, 7)>
<9, (2, 4, 5)>
