Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The 3-stars are:

<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<2, (0, 1, 5)>
<4, (0, 1, 5)>
<5, (1, 4, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
