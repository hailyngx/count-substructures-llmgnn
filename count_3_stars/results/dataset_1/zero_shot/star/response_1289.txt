Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are:

<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<4, (0, 5, 7)>
<5, (0, 1, 8)>
<8, (1, 3, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
