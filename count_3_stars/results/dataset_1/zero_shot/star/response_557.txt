Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
The first 3-star is <0, (2, 7, 8)>.
The second 3-star is <4, (1, 5, 9)>.
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
