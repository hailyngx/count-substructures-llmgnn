Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated by counting the number of nodes that can serve as the central node. In this case, nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9 can each be the center of a 3-star.

Let's count the number of 3-stars for each potential central node:

For node 0:
- <0, (2, 3, 5)>
- <0, (2, 5, 6)>
- <0, (2, 5, 8)>
- <0, (3, 5, 6)>
- <0, (3, 5, 8)>

For node 1:
- <1, (2, 4, 8)>

For node 2:
- <2, (0, 1, 7)>
- <2, (0, 5, 7)>

For node 3:
- <3, (0, 5, 9)>

For node 4:
No 3-stars.

For node 5:
No 3-stars.

For node 6:
No 3-stars.

For node 8:
No 3-stars.

For node 9:
No 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
