Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The answer is [6].
  
The 3-stars are:
<0, (8, 2, 5)>
<1, (3, 5, 6)>
<2, (4, 8, 0)>
<3, (1, 4, 5)>
<4, (2, 3, 5)>
<5, (1, 4, 6)>
