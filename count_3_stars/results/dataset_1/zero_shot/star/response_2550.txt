Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 5 total 3-stars in this graph. Here are the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (1, 8, 9)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<2, (5, 7, 8)>
<4, (1, 3, 9)>
<9, (0, 2, 4)> 

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
