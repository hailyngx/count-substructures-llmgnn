Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 3-star structures in this graph. Here are the unique 3-star configurations:

<0, (4, 8, 3)>
<1, (6, 7, 9)>
<2, (5, 6, 8)> 

So the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
