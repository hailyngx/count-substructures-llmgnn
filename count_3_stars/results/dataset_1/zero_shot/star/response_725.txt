Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [5] 3-stars in the given graph.

The 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 7, 1)>
<2, (4, 7, 0)>
<3, (0, 4, 9)>
<4, (2, 3, 7)>
<9, (3, 4, 8)>
