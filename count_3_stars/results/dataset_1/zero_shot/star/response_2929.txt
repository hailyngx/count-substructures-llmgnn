Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The unique 3-stars are:

<0, (5, 9, -)>
<1, (3, 7, -)>
<2, (9, -, -)>
<5, (0, 3, 7)>
<6, (3, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
