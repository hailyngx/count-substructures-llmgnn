Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 7) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-star graphs in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<0, (6, 7, 9)>
<6, (0, 7, 8)>
<9, (0, 1, 6)>
<7, (0, 2, 4)>
<7, (2, 4, 6)>
