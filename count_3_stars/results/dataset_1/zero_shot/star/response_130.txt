Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars: 
<0, (7, 8, 9)>
<1, (4, 5, 6)>
<2, (6, 8, 9)>
<3, (4, 8, 9)>
<4, (1, 3, 8)>
<5, (1, 7, 9)>
<6, (1, 2, 7)>
<7, (0, 5, 6)>
<8, (0, 4, 9)>
<9, (0, 6, 8)>

Therefore, there are [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
