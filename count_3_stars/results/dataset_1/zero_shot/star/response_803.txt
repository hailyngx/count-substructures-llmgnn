Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 4, 7)>
<1, (0, 3, 5)>
<3, (1, 4, 9)>
<5, (1, 6, 7)>
