Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<0, (1, 3, 8)>
<2, (1, 6, 9)>
<3, (0, 6, 9)>
<6, (2, 3, 9)>
