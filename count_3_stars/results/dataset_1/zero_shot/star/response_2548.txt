Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (5, 7, 9)>
<1, (4, 5, 7)>
<2, (3, 6, 9)>
<3, (2, 4, 9)>
