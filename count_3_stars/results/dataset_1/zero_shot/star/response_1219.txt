Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 8, 9)>
<1, (4, 5, 6)>
<2, (4, 5, 8)>
<4, (1, 2, 3)>
