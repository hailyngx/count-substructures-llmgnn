Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
The unique 3-stars are: <0, (1, 4, 5)>, <0, (6, 8, 5)>, <1, (0, 7, 3)>, <4, (0, 5, 9)>
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [4].
