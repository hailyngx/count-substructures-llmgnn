Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are:

<1, (4, 5, 6)>
<3, (4, 5, 6)>
<4, (1, 3, 8)>
<5, (1, 3, 7)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
