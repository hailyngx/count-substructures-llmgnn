Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:
```
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 2), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 8), (2, 9), (3, 4), (3, 8), (3, 9), (4, 3), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 8), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 4), (7, 2), (7, 8), (7, 9), (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 5), (8, 7), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 7)
```

To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all unique 3-stars. 

1. <2, (1, 5, 6)>
2. <2, (7, 8, 9)>
[2]
