Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 7, 9)>
<2, (6, 7, 5)>
<4, (0, 6, 7)>
<5, (3, 7, 8)>
<6, (2, 4, 7)>
<7, (0, 1, 2)>
<7, (4, 5, 9)>
