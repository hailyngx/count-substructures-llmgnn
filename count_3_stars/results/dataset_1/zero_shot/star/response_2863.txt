Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (5, 6, 7)>
<2, (0, 7, 8)>
<3, (0, 9, -)>
<5, (1, 4, 6)>
