Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].

The 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 4, 9)>
<1, (0, 2, -)>
<2, (1, 3, 4)>
<3, (2, 7, -)>
<4, (0, 2, 7)>
<5, (7, 8, 9)>
<6, (9, -, -)>
<7, (3, 4, 5)>
<8, (2, 5, -)>
<9, (0, 4, 6)>
