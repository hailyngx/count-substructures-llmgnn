Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 4, 8)>
<1, (7, 8, 3)>
<2, (0, 8, 1)>
<5, (3, 9, 6)>
