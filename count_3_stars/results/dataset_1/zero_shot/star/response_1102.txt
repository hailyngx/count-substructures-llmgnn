Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Each 3-star is listed only once below:

<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<1, (0, 6, 8)>
<2, (3, 8, 9)>
<4, (0, 5, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
