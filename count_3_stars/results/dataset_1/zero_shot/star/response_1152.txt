Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 2) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 3 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
The 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 5, 0)>
<2, (6, 8, 2)>
<9, (4, 8, 9)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
