Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 6) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars: 

- <0, (6, 9, 1)>
- <1, (7, 8, 9)>
- <6, (0, 3, 8)>
- <8, (1, 6, 9)>
- <9, (0, 1, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
