Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are a total of [29] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 4, 8)>
<1, (2, 3, 5)>
<2, (1, 3, 4)>
<2, (3, 6, 7)>
<6, (2, 3, 9)>
