Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 6, 9)>
<2, (0, 8, 9)>
<4, (5, 9, 0)>
<6, (0, 1, 3)>
