Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are 4 3-stars in the given graph. 

The 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<2, (0, 8, 9)>
<4, (0, 3, 5)>
<5, (3, 4, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [4].
