Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, 5, 8
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 6
- Node 3 is connected to node 6
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 9
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 6
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8
- Node 7 is connected to node 6
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 6
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 4

To identify the 3-stars in the graph, we look for nodes that are connected to three other nodes. 
Here are the 3-stars found:
1. <0, (1, 4, 5)>
2. <0, (1, 4, 9)>
3. <0, (1, 5, 6)>
4. <1, (0, 2, 4)>
5. <1, (0, 4, 5)>
6. <1, (0, 4, 8)>
7. <1, (0, 5, 6)>
8. <1, (0, 5, 8)>
9. <1, (2, 4, 6)>
10. <4, (0, 1, 2)>
11. <4, (0, 1, 9)>
12. <4, (1, 0, 2)>
13. <4, (1, 0, 9)>
14. <4, (2, 1, 0)>
15. <5, (0, 1, 6)>
16. <5, (1, 0, 6)>
17. <6, (0, 2, 3)>
18. <6, (0, 5, 1)>
19. <6, (0, 8, 1)>
20. <6, (2, 4, 1)>
21. <6, (2, 4, 1)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [21].
