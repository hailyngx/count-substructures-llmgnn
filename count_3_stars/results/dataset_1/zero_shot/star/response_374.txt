Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars are <0, (1, 2, 6)>, <1, (0, 3, 5)>, <2, (0, 3, 8)>, and <8, (1, 2, 9)>.
