Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are 8 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The number of 3-stars is [8].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 4, 7)>
<1, (3, 6, )>
<2, (0, 3, 5)>
<2, (0, 4, 7)>
<2, (3, 5, 7)>
<2, (4, 5, 7)>
<3, (1, 2, 6)>
<4, (0, 2, 9)>
