Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
We can identify the 3-stars in the given graph by looking for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list the 3-stars present in the graph:

<0, (2, 6, 8)>
<1, (3, 4, 8)>
<2, (0, 3, 6)>
<3, (1, 2, 5)>
<4, (1, 5, 8)>
<5, (3, 4, -)>
<6, (0, 2, 8)>
<8, (1, 4, 6)>

There are a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
