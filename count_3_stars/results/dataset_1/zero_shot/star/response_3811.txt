Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 3 3-stars in the given graph. The unique 3-stars are <0, (1, 2, 3)>, <3, (0, 6, 7)>, and <7, (0, 4, 9)>. Therefore, the answer is [3].
