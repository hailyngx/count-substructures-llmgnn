Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph.  
The number of 3-stars is [6].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (5, 8, 9)>
<1, (5, 7, 9)>
<5, (0, 1, 7)>
<7, (1, 5, 8)>
<8, (0, 3, 6)>
<9, (0, 1, 2)>
