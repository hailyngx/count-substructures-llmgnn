Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
    
    The unique 3-stars found are:
    <0, (7, 8, 9)>
    <1, (2, 4, 7)>
    <2, (1, 3, 9)>
    <6, (5, 7, 8)>
    <8, (0, 4, 6)>
