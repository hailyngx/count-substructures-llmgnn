Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [6] unique 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<1, (0, 2, 5)>
<2, (0, 1, 8)>
<4, (0, 6, 8)>
<5, (1, 8, 9)>
<6, (4, 8, 9)>
