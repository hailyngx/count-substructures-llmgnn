Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-star subgraphs in the given graph.

<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<2, (3, 7, 8)>
<3, (0, 2, 4)>
<4, (0, 3, 6)>
<6, (3, 4, 7)>
<7, (2, 6, 8)>
