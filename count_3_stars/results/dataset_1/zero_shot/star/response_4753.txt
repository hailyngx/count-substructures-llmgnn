Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The given graph can be illustrated as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 5, and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0 and 4.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 7, 8, and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 5, 6, and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 4 and 8.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 3 and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 3, 6, and 7.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, and 5.

To count the number of 3-stars, we need to find all groups of nodes where one node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list the unique 3-stars found in this graph:
<0, (2, 3, 5)>
<0, (3, 5, 9)>
<2, (0, 4, 5)>
<3, (0, 4, 9)>
<4, (2, 3, 5)>
<4, (3, 5, 9)>
<5, (0, 4, 9)>
<9, (0, 3, 5)>

There are a total of 8 unique 3-stars in the given graph, so the final answer is [8].
