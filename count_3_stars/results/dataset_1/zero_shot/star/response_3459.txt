Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The central node of a 3-star graph needs to be connected to exactly 3 other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <1, (3, 7, 9)>
2. <3, (1, 5, 6)>
3. <6, (3, 7, 9)>
4. <7, (0, 1, 6)>
5. <8, (3, 5, 9)>
6. <9, (1, 3, 8)>

There are a total of 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the final answer is [6].
