Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [3] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (5, 9, 4)>
<5, (0, 4, 6)>
<9, (0, 4, 8)>
