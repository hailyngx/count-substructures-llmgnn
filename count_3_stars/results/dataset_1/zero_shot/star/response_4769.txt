Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are listed below within angle brackets:

<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<1, (2, 5, 7)>
<5, (2, 6, 8)>
<6, (1, 4, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
