Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be found by identifying the center nodes and their corresponding leaves. 

The center nodes in this graph are: 2, 6, 8, and 9.

Let's count the number of 3-stars for each center node:
- For center node 2: (0, 2, 6), (2, 6, 1), (2, 7, 8), and (2, 8, 7) => <2, (0, 6, 7), (1, 6, 2), (7, 8, 2)>
- For center node 6: (1, 6, 9), (2, 6, 7), and (6, 5, 1) => <6, (1, 9, 6), (2, 7, 6), (5, 6, 1)>
- For center node 8: (3, 8, 9), (7, 8, 2), and (8, 2, 3) => <8, (3, 9, 8), (2, 7, 8), (2, 3, 8)>
- For center node 9: (1, 9, 7), (8, 9, 2), and (9, 7, 8) => <9, (1, 7, 9), (2, 9, 8), (7, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
