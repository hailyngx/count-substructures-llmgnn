Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are: 
<0, (4, 6, 7)>
<2, (7, 8, 9)>
<3, (5, 9, (1, 2))>
<8, (0, 2, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4].
