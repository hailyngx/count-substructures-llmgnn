Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:
- <0, (1, 4, 0)>
- <2, (5, 9, 2)>
- <3, (5, 7, 3)>
- <5, (2, 9, 5)>
- <7, (5, 8, 7)>
- <8, (5, 7, 8)>
- <9, (2, 5, 9)>

Therefore, there are a total of [7] 3-stars in the given graph.
