Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph can be calculated by finding all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern.

From the provided edge list, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<2, (0, 5, 7)>
<5, (1, 2, 3)>
<8, (0, 4, 6)>
<9, (2, 3, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
