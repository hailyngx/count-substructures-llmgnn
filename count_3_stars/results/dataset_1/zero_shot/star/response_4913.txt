Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
There are 3-star graphs that can be formed in the given graph. Here is the count along with the unique 3-stars:

[<0, (1, 5, 8)>, <1, (0, 2, 3)>, <2, (1, 3, 8)>, <3, (1, 2, 8)>, <5, (0, 1, 8)>, <6, (2, 4, 7)>, <7, (3, 5, 8)>, <8, (0, 2, 3)>]
