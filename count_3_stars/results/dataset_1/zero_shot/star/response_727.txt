Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 3 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here is the list of 3-stars along with the central node and leaves:

<0, (5, 9, 2)>
<1, (2, 4, 7)>
<2, (1, 3, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
