Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
The center nodes of the 3-stars in this graph can be {2, 3, 6, 7}. Let's count the number of 3-stars for each center node:

For center node 2:
- (2, 1, 5)
- (2, 1, 9)
- (2, 5, 1)
- (2, 5, 9)
- (2, 6, 7)
- (2, 6, 3)
- (2, 7, 6)

For center node 3:
- (3, 1, 6)
- (3, 6, 2)
- (3, 6, 7)
- (3, 7, 6)

For center node 6:
- (6, 2, 7)
- (6, 3, 7)
- (6, 7, 2)
- (6, 7, 3)
- (6, 7, 8)

For center node 7:
- (7, 2, 6)
- (7, 3, 6)
- (7, 6, 2)
- (7, 6, 3)
- (7, 6, 8)

Therefore, there are a total of [15] 3-stars in this graph. The unique 3-stars are:
<2, (1, 5, 9)>
<2, (6, 3, 7)>
<2, (7, 6, 3)>
<3, (1, 6, 2)>
<6, (7, 2, 6)>
<6, (7, 3, 6)>
<6, (7, 8, 6)>
<7, (2, 6, 3)>
