Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 4.

The unique 3-stars in the graph are:
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<2, (0, 3, 5)>
<4, (0, 3, 6)>
<6, (0, 1, 5)>

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
