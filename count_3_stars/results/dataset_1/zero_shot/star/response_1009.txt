Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are a total of [4] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (5, 7, 9)>
<3, (0, 9, 1)>
<5, (1, 4, 8)>
<7, (1, 4, 6)>
