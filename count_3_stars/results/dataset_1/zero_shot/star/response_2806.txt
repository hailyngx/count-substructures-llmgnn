Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (2, 4, 7)>
<3, (6, 8, 9)>
<7, (1, 5, 9)>
