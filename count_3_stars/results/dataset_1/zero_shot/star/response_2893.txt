Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are two 3-stars in the given graph. The unique 3-stars found are:

<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<2, (6, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
