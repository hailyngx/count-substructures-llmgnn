Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 4 3-stars in the given graph. Here are the unique 3-stars found inside <>:
<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<6, (0, 4, 7)>
<3, (2, 4, 7)>
<4, (0, 2, 6)> 

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
