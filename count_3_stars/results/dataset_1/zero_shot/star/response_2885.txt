Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 6) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is as follows:

[<3, (2, 6, 9)>, <4, (0, 7, 9)>, <6, (1, 5, 7)>, <9, (3, 4, 5)>]
