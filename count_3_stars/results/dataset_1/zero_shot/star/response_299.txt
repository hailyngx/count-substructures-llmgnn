Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 5, 8)>
<1, (2, 6, 7)>
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<2, (0, 4, 8)>
<3, (2, 4, 8)>
<4, (3, 9, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
