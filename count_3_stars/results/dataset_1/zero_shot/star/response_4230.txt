Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.  
The unique 3-stars are <0, (5, 8, 3)>, <1, (3, 6, 7)>, <2, (5, 9, 4)>, and <3, (1, 5, 8)>.
