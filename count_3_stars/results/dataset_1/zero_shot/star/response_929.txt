Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 3-star graphs in this given graph. Let's list them out:

<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<2, (0, 3, 4)>
<3, (1, 2, 9)>
<4, (2, 3, 5)>
<7, (4, 6, 9)>

Thus, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
