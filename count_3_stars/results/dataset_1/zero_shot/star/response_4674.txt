Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here is the list of unique 3-stars:
<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<9, (1, 2, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
