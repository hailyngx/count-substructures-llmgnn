Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
There are [5] 3-stars in the given graph.  

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 5, 0)>
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<2, (1, 4, 9)>
<3, (1, 5, 6)>
<4, (1, 2, 6)>
