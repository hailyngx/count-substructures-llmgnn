Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (7, 8, 9)>
<1, (2, 6, 7)>
<2, (1, 4, 5)>
<2, (4, 5, 7)>
<6, (1, 3, 7)>
<6, (3, 7, 9)>
<7, (1, 6, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 7)>
