Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here are the unique 3-stars:

<0, (2, 8, 9)>
<3, (2, 5, 9)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
