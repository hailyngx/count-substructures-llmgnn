Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in this graph is [4].
    <0, (2, 4, 8)>
    <1, (4, 5, 6)>
    <2, (0, 7, 8)>
    <4, (0, 1, 5)>
