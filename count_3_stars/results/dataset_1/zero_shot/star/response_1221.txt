Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Below are the 3-stars found:

<0, (3, 7, 9)>
<2, (4, 6, 9)>
<4, (2, 6, 9)>
<6, (4, 5, 8)>

So the final answer is [4].
