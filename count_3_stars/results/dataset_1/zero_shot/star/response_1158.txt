Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].  
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:  
<2, (0, 3, 5)>  
<3, (2, 6, 9)>  
<4, (6, 7, 8)>  
<6, (3, 4, 8)>  
<7, (4, 6, 9)>
