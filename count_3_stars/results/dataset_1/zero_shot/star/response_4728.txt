Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The graph contains the following 3-stars:

[<0, (2, 3, 8)>, <1, (2, 5, 9)>, <3, (0, 4, 6)>, <5, (1, 2, 4)>, <6, (1, 3, 7)>, <8, (0, 9, None)>, <9, (1, 2, 3)>]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
