Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are as follows:
[<1, (3, 5, 8)>, <1, (5, 3, 8)>, <3, (1, 8, 9)>, <3, (5, 8, 9)>, <5, (1, 3, 4)>, <5, (2, 4, 6)>, <5, (2, 4, 7)>, <5, (2, 4, 5)>, <5, (4, 2, 7)>, <5, (4, 2, 7)>, <5, (4, 6, 7)>, <5, (4, 7, 6)>, <5, (4, 7, 2)>, <5, (4, 6, 7)>, <5, (4, 7, 6)>, <5, (7, 2, 4)>, <5, (7, 2, 4)>, <5, (7, 4, 2)>, <5, (7, 4, 6)>, <5, (7, 4, 2)>, <5, (6, 4, 7)>, <5, (6, 4, 7)>, <5, (7, 4, 2)>, <5, (7, 4, 6)>, <5, (7, 4, 2)>, <5, (7, 6, 4)>]
Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [25].
