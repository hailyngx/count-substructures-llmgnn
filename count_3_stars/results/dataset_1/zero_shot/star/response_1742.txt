Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [5] unique 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (0, 2, 8)>
<2, (1, 3, 6)>
<4, (6, 8, 9)>
<5, (2, 7, 9)>
<9, (5, 6, 8)>
