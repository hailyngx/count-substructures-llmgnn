Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are:
<0, (1, 4, 8)>
<1, (0, 5, 7)>
<3, (5, 6, 9)>
<4, (0, 2, 9)>
<5, (1, 3, 6)>
<9, (1, 4, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
