Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 4 3-stars in the given graph. 
The unique 3-stars are:
<2, (0, 3, 4)>
<3, (2, 4, 0)>
<5, (6, 9, 7)>
<6, (5, 7, 9)>
Therefore, the final answer is [4].
