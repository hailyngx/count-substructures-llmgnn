Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-star subgraphs in this graph. The list of unique 3-stars is as follows:
    <0, (1, 4, 5)>
    <1, (0, 2, 6)>
    <2, (1, 4, 8)>
    <4, (0, 2, 5)>
    <5, (1, 3, 4)>
    <7, (1, 4, 6)>
    
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [6].
