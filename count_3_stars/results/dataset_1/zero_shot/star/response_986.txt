Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (6, 4) (7, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are as follows:
- <1, (4, 7, 2)>
- <2, (3, 8, 9)>
- <3, (2, 9, -)>
- <4, (1, 2, 6)>
- <6, (4, -, -)>
- <7, (1, -, -)>
- <8, (2, 9, -)>
- <9, (3, 8, -)>

Therefore, there are a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
