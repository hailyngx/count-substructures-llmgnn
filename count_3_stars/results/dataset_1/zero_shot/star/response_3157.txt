Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are as follows:
[<0, (2, 7, 7)>, <2, (0, 6, 9)>, <4, (1, 3, 5)>, <7, (0, 3, 6)>, <8, (4, 5, 7)>]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
