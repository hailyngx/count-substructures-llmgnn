Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.
  
Unique 3-stars: <7, (1, 8, 9)>, <1, (7, 8, 9)>, <8, (1, 7, 9)>, <9, (1, 7, 8)>
