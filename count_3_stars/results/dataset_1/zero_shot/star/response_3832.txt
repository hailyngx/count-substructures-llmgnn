Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here is the count of 3-stars inside brackets: [5].
   
   The unique 3-stars are:
   <1, (0, 9, 5)>
   <3, (4, 5, 7)>
   <4, (3, 7, 5)>
   <5, (3, 7, 9)>
   <7, (2, 4, 5)>
