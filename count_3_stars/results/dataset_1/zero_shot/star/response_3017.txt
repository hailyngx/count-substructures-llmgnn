Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are:

<0, (3, 4, 6)>
<2, (4, 5, 6)>
<4, (0, 7, 9)>
<6, (0, 3, 4)>
<7, (0, 4, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
