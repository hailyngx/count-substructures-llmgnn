Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:

[<2, (3, 7, 8)>, <3, (2, 7, 8)>, <4, (7, 8, 5)>, <5, (0, 6, 8)>] 

There are a total of [4] 3-star structures in the graph.
