Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 9 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The list of 3-stars is as follows:
<0, (1, 6, 9)>
<1, (0, 6, 2)>
<2, (3, 6, 8)>
<3, (2, 6, 8)>
<4, (5, 8, 9)>
<5, (4, 8, 9)>
<6, (1, 2, 3)>
<8, (2, 4, 6)>
<9, (4, 5, 6)>
