Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

Here is the list of unique 3-stars: 
<0, (4, 6, 7)>
<1, (3, 7, 8)>
<1, (7, 8, 9)>
<8, (1, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
