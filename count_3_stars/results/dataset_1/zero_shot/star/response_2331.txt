Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 2, 7)>
<1, (0, 4, 7)>
<2, (0, 8, 9)>
<7, (0, 4, 5)>
