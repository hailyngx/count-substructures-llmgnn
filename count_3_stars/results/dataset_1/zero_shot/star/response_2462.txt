Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
There are a total of [6] 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 7, 5)>
<2, (3, 8, 9)>
<3, (0, 2, 5)>
<5, (3, 7, 7)>
<7, (0, 3, 5)>
<8, (2, 4, 2)>
