Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph.  

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 2, 7)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<2, (0, 4, 7)>
<3, (1, 6, 8)>
<4, (1, 2, 5)>
<8, (3, 5, 9)>
