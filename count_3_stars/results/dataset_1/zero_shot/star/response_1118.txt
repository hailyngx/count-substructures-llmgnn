Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are total \[12\] 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 3, 9)>
<2, (0, 3, 4)>
<3, (0, 2, 6)>
<4, (1, 2, 7)>
<7, (2, 4, 8)>
