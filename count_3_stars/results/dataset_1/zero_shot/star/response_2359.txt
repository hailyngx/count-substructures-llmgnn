Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are four 3-star structures in the given graph.  

The 3-stars are: 
<0, (2, 4, 7)>
<2, (0, 1, 6)>
<6, (2, 4, 8)>
<7, (0, 1, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
