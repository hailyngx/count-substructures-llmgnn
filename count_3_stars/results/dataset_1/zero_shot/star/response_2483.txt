Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:
[<0, (4, 5)> <1, (3, 5)> <2, (5, 6)> <3, (1, 6)> <4, (0, 8)> <7, (2, 3, 8)>]
There are 6 unique 3-stars in total. Therefore, the answer is [6].
