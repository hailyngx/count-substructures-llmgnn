Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 4) (6, 9) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 3 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are:

<0, (1, 9, 9)>
<1, (0, 5, 9)>
<4, (5, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
