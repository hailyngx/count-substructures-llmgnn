Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 6, 7)>
<0, (2, 6, 8)>
<0, (7, 8, 5)>
<4, (1, 5, 7)>
<4, (1, 5, 9)>
<4, (2, 5, 8)>
