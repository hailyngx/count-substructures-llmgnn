Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The answer is [4].  

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 8, 1)>
<1, (4, 0, 7)>
<3, (2, 8, 9)>
<6, (4, 7, 8)>
