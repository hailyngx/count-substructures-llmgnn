Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are <0, (7, 2, 4)>, <1, (6, 9, 2)>, <2, (3, 5, 6)>, <2, (5, 3, 9)>, <2, (6, 1, 7)>, and <2, (7, 4, 9)> 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [6].
