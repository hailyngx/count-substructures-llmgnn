Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The 3-stars are:

<0, (3, 4, 6)>
<1, (3, 7, 9)>
<4, (0, 2, 6)>
<8, (0, 3, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
