Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
The unique 3-stars are: <0, (1, 6, 8)>, <1, (0, 6, 8)>, <8, (0, 6, 1)>, <5, (0, 9, 8)>, <9, (0, 5, 8)>, <4, (1, 2, 9)>.
