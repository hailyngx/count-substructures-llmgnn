Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (5, 6, 4)>
<2, (7, 4, 9)>
<3, (5, 9, 1)>
<4, (6, 7, 8)>
<5, (1, 3, 6)>
<6, (4, 6, 8)>
<7, (2, 7, 9)>
<8, (6, 7, 4)>
<9, (3, 9, 5)>
<10, (8, 9, 6)>
