Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The unique 3-stars in the given graph are:
    <0, (5, 6, 7)>
    <1, (4, 6, 7)>
    <2, (3, 6, 8)>
    <2, (3, 6, 9)>
    <4, (1, 6, 9)>
    <5, (0, 8, 9)>
    <6, (0, 1, 2)>
    <6, (0, 2, 3)>
    <6, (1, 4, 6)>
    <6, (2, 3, 6)>
    <6, (4, 6, 9)>
    <6, (6, 7, 9)>
    <9, (2, 3, 6)>
    <9, (4, 6, 9)>
  
There are 14 unique 3-stars in total. Thus, the answer is [14].
