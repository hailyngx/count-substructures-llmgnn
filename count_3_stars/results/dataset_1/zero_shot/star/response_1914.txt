Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are <1, (5, 8, 9)>, <2, (0, 3, 4)>, <5, (1, 6, 9)>, and <9, (1, 5, 9)>.
