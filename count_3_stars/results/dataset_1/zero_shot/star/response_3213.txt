Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

The 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 4, 7)>
<2, (4, 5, 8)>
<3, (0, 4, 7)>
<4, (0, 2, 5)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
