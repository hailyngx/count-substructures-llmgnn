Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are:

<0, (3, 5, 8)>
<2, (4, 5, 7)>
<4, (1, 2, 5)>
<7, (2, 4, 5)>
<8, (3, 7, 9)>

Therefore, there are 5 3-stars in the given graph. The final answer is [5].
