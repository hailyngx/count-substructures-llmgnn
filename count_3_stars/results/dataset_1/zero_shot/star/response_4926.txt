Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 46 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 5, 9)>
<2, (4, 6, 8)>
<3, (1, 5, 7)>
<5, (0, 3, 4)>
<6, (2, 5, 9)>
<8, (2, 5, 9)>
