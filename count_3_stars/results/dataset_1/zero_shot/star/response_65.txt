Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has 6 different 3-stars. Here is the list of unique 3-stars found:
<0, (2, 6, 1)>, <1, (4, 9, 6)>, <2, (0, 6, 3)>, <3, (2, 5, 9)>, <4, (1, 6, 9)>, <7, (9, 8, 6)>
The count of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
