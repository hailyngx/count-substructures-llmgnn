Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (5, 6, 7)>
<0, (5, 2, 8)>
<7, (0, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
