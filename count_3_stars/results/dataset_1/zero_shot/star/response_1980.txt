Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

The 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 7, 8)>
<1, (0, 2, 8)>
<2, (1, 3, 4)>
<3, (2, 7, 8)>
<6, (5, 7, 9)>
<8, (1, 2, 9)>
