Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph.

<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<1, (0, 3, 5)>
<2, (5, 7, 9)>
<3, (1, 5, 9)>
<5, (1, 2, 3)>
<7, (0, 5, 8)>
