Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are:
<0, (1, 8, 9)>
<1, (0, 3, 5)>
<2, (4, 8, 9)>
<3, (1, 4, 5)>
<4, (2, 3, 5)>
<5, (1, 3, 6)>
<6, (5, 9, 7)>
<8, (0, 2, 9)>
<9, (1, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
