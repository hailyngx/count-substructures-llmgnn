Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are as follows:
- <0, (5, 4, 8)>
- <1, (8, 5, 0)>
- <2, (7, 4, 5)>
- <3, (9, 5, 0)>
- <4, (5, 0, 7)>
- <5, (0, 4, 8)>
- <7, (4, 2, 5)>
- <8, (1, 5, 0)>
- <9, (3, 5, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
