Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 6) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in this graph. Here they are listed below:

<0, (4, 6, 3)>
<3, (1, 4, 6)>
<4, (0, 3, 5)>
<6, (0, 3, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
