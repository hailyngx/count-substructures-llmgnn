Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
The given graph can be visualized as follows:
```
0 --- 2     5 --- 7
|     |     |     |
6     1 --- 8     4
      |         /
      9 ----- /
```

Let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 6. So, <0, (2, 5, 6)> is a 3-star.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 6. So, <1, (2, 4, 6)> is a 3-star.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 6, and 7. So, <5, (0, 6, 7)> is a 3-star.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 5. So, <6, (0, 1, 5)> is a 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
