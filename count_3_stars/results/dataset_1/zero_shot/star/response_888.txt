Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The 3-stars are represented as follows:
<0, (2, 3, 7)>
<3, (0, 2, 4)>
<4, (1, 2, 3)>
<9, (3, 4, 5)>

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
