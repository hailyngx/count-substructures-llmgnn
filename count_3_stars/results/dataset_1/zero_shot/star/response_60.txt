Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The count is shown below:

\[6\] 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<2, (3, 6, 7)>
<4, (0, 5, 8)>
<5, (0, 4, 8)>
<6, (2, 3, 8)>
<8, (4, 5, 6)>
