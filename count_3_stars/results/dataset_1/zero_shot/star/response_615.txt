Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 3 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are:

<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<1, (0, 4, 5)>
<5, (0, 3, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
