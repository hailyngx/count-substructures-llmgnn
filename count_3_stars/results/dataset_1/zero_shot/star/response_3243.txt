Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are <0, (2, 5, 9)>, <2, (0, 5, 6)>, and <4, (2, 3, 9)> 3-stars in this graph. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [3].
