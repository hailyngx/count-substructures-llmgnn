Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The number of unique 3-star structures in the given graph can be calculated by identifying nodes that are connected in a star pattern. Here are the 3-star structures found in the graph:

[<0, (1, 9, 3)>, <1, (0, 9, 3)>, <1, (3, 4, 2)>, <1, (4, 8, 9)>, <3, (1, 8, 9)>, <4, (1, 8, 3)>, <4, (2, 6, 5)>, <4, (3, 8, 9)>, <5, (4, 7, 8)>, <8, (1, 3, 4)>, <8, (4, 5, 7)>, <9, (0, 1, 3)>]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [12].
