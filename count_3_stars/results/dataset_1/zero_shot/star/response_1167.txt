Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 6, 9)>
<2, (3, 4, 5)>
<3, (1, 2, 6)>
<3, (2, 3, 8)>
<3, (6, 3, 8)>
<4, (0, 2, 7)>
<5, (2, 7, 9)>
<6, (0, 3, 8)>
<8, (3, 6, 8)>
