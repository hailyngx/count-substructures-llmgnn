Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
The given graph contains the following 3-star structures:
[<0, (5, 9, 1)>, <4, (3, 6, 5)>]  

Therefore, there are a total of 2 3-stars in the given graph.  
Output: [2]
