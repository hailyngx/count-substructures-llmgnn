Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as:

```
0 -- 4
|      
1      7      2
       |       | \
       |       |  3 -- 9
       |       | /|
       6 -- 8  4
                | 
                5
```

There are 3-stars with the following combinations:
<2, (3, 7, 8)>
<3, (2, 4, 8)>
<4, (0, 2, 3)>
<6, (3, 4, 8)>
<8, (2, 3, 4)>
<9, (2, 6, 8)>

Count of 3-stars: [6]
