Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (8, 3) (9, 0) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

The 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 6, 9)>
<3, (4, 8, 0)>
<4, (0, 3, 6)>
<6, (0, 1, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
