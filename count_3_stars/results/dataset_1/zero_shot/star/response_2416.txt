Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6]. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (5, 7, 8)>
<1, (3, 6, 8)>
<2, (3, 9, -)>
<3, (1, 2, 4)>
<4, (3, 5, -)>
<5, (0, 4, 8)>
