Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars found in the given graph. 

The 3-stars are: 
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<4, (0, 1, 9)>
<7, (0, 2, 6)>
<9, (0, 1, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
