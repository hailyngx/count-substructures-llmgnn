Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The count of 3-stars is [2].
    
    <0, (6, 8, 1)>
    <3, (4, 7, 8)>
