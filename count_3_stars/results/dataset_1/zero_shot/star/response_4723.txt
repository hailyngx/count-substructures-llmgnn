Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:

[<0, (4, 1, 2)>, <1, (4, 5, 3)>, <2, (4, 6, 6)>, <3, (5, 6, 8)>, <5, (4, 7, 9)>, <6, (3, 7, 8)>] 

There are a total of 6 3-stars in this graph. So, the answer is [6].
