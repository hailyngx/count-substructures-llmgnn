Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 5) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the given graph:

<1, (2, 8, 9)>
<2, (0, 1, 5)>
<5, (3, 6, 9)>
<6, (7, 8, 5)>
<8, (1, 6, 2)>
<9, (1, 5, 7)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph. 

So, the final answer is: [6].
