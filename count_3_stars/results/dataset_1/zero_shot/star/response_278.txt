Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 6 different 3-stars in the given graph.  

Here are the unique 3-stars found: 
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<0, (7, 9, 9)>
<1, (0, 8, 8)>
<2, (5, 8, 9)>
<3, (5, 7, 9)>
<4, (0, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the final answer is [6].
