Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [8] 3-stars in the given graph, and they are as follows:
<0, (5, 6, 7)>
<1, (6, 8, 9)>
<2, (3, 5, 6)>
<2, (6, 7, 9)>
<3, (2, 7, 8)>
<4, (5, 8, 8)>
<5, (0, 2, 4)>
<6, (0, 1, 2)>
