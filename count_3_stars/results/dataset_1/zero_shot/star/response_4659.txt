Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [2] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (2, 4, 8)>
<8, (1, 7, 9)>
