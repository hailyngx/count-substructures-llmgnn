Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [7] 3-stars in the given graph. 
The unique 3-star configurations are:
<0, (1, 3, 6)>
<3, (0, 1, 6)>
<3, (6, 7, 9)>
<4, (5, 7, 9)>
<5, (4, 7, 9)>
<6, (3, 7, 9)>
<7, (3, 5, 6)>
