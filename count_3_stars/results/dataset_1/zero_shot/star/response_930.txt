Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are three 3-stars in this graph. Here they are listed inside brackets:
