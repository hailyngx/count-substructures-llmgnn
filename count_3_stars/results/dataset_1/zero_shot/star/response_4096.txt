Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-star structures:
- <0, (1, 9, 9)>
- <1, (0, 5, 6)>
- <2, (3, 6, 9)>
- <3, (2, 7, 8)>
- <4, (8, 8, None)>
- <5, (1, None, None)>
- <6, (1, 2, 7)>
- <7, (3, 6, 8)>
- <8, (2, 3, 4)>
- <9, (0, 2, 3)>
