Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<1, (0, 5, 7)>
<1, (5, 7, 8)>
<4, (0, 3, 8)>
<4, (3, 6, 8)>
<5, (0, 1, 2)>
