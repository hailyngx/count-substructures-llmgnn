Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 5 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are listed inside <> brackets:

<1, (3, 6, 7)>
<2, (0, 3, 4)>
<3, (1, 2, 4)>
<6, (1, 7, 9)>
<9, (1, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
