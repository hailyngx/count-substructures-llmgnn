Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) 

Response:
There are 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (6, 3, 5)>
<1, (5, 7, 8)>
<2, (4, 7, 8)>
<3, (4, 6, 2)>
<4, (2, 3, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
