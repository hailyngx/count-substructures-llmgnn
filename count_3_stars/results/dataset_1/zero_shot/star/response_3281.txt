Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 6 3-stars in the given graph. Here is the list of unique 3-stars found:

<2, (1, 4, 6)>
<4, (1, 2, 7)>
<6, (2, 5, 8)>
<7, (0, 4, 9)>
<8, (2, 5, 6)>
<9, (7, -1, -1)>

Therefore, the final answer is [6].
