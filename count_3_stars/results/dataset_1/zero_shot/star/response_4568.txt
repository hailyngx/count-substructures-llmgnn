Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are a total of [6] 3-star patterns in the given graph.

These 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 3, 6)>
<1, (0, 2, 8)>
<2, (1, 6, 8)>
<4, (7, 9, 7)>
<7, (4, 6, 8)>
<9, (4, 5, 6)>
