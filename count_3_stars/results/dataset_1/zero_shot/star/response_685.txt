Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph can be determined by identifying all unique 3-stars based on the definition provided. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<1, (0, 6, 2)>
<2, (6, 9, 9)>
<3, (5, 6, 5)>
<4, (7, 9, 9)>
<5, (0, 3, 9)>
<6, (1, 2, 3)>
<7, (0, 4, 9)>
<8, (9, 9, -)>
<9, (2, 4, 5)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we get a total of [9].
