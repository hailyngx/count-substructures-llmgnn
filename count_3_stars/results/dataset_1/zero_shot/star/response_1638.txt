Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

The 3-stars are: 
<3, (7, 8, 9)>
<8, (3, 4, 6)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
