Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The central nodes of the 3-stars can be 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, or 9. Let's count the number of 3-stars.

Number of 3-stars with central node 0: <0, (2, 0, -)>
Number of 3-stars with central node 1: <1, (6, 1, 8)>
Number of 3-stars with central node 2: <2, (0, 2, -)>
Number of 3-stars with central node 4: <4, (6, 4, 7)>
Number of 3-stars with central node 5: <5, (8, 5, -)>
Number of 3-stars with central node 6: <6, (1, 6, 9)>
Number of 3-stars with central node 7: <7, (4, 7, -)>
Number of 3-stars with central node 8: <8, (1, 8, 5)>
Number of 3-stars with central node 9: <9, (6, 9, -)>

Total number of 3-stars in the graph: [9]
