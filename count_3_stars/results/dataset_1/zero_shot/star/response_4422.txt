Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The graph has the following 3-stars:
[<0, (1, 8, 5)>, <1, (0, 9, 5)>, <3, (5, 9, 7)>, <6, (7, 9, 6)>]
