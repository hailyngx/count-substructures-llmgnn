Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
The 3-stars are:
<1, (7, 8, 5)>
<6, (1, 2, 4)>
Therefore, the final answer is [2].
