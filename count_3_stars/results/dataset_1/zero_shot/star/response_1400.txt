Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
Therefore, the answer is [4].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<2, (0, 3, 6)>
<3, (2, 6, 8)>
<6, (2, 5, 8)>
