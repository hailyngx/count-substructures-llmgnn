Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be calculated by finding the number of nodes that can act as the center of a 3-star. Each 3-star has one center node and three connected nodes. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars using the given graph:

1. Node 0 can form a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, and 4: <0, (1, 3, 4)>
2. Node 3 can form a 3-star with nodes 0, 7, and 9: <3, (0, 7, 9)>
3. Node 4 can form a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, and 2: <4, (0, 1, 2)>
4. Node 2 can form a 3-star with nodes 4, 6, and 7: <2, (4, 6, 7)>
5. Node 7 can form a 3-star with nodes 2, 3, and 8: <7, (2, 3, 8)>
6. Node 9 can form a 3-star with nodes 3, 4, and 5: <9, (3, 4, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
