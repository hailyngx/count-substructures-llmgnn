Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of 3-stars in this graph. Here they are:

[2, (0, 1, 3)]
[4, (0, 1, 8)]
[8, (1, 3, 8)]

Therefore, the final answer is [3].
