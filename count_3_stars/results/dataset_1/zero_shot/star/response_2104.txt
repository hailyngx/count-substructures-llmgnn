Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph contains the following 3-stars and their corresponding centers:
1. <0, (2, 6, 6)>
2. <1, (3, 7, 7)>
3. <2, (0, 4, 5)>
4. <4, (2, 5, 9)>
5. <6, (0, 2, 8)>
6. <8, (2, 6, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
