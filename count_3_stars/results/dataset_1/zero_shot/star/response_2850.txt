Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 3-stars in this graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 4, 7)>
<1, (0, 7, 8)>
<8, (1, 3, 4)>

So the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
