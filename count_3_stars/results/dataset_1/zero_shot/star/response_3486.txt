Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
The 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 5, 7)>
<1, (3, 8, 2)>
<4, (6, 8, 7)>
<6, (4, 7, 7)>
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
