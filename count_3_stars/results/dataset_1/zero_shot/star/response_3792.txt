Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are:
    
    <1, (0, 4, 7)>
    <1, (2, 7, 9)>
    <2, (1, 3, 7)>
    <3, (2, 5, 7)>
    <4, (1, 5, 7)>
    <7, (1, 2, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
