Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
The 3-stars are:
<0, (8, 9)>
<1, (4, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [2].
