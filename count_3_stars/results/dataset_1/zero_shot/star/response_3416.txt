Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:
  - Nodes: [0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 9]
  - Edges: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 9), (1, 2), (1, 9), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 5), (2, 8), (3, 0), (5, 2), (5, 8), (8, 2), (8, 5), (9, 0), (9, 1)

We need to find the number of 3-stars in this graph.

From the given edges, we can identify the three 3-stars present in the graph:
1. <0, (2, 3, 9)>
2. <1, (2, 9, 0)>
3. <2, (0, 1, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
