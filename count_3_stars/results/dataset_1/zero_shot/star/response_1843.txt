Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph can be found by counting the number of 3-stars centered at each node. Let's do that:

- Node 0: (0, 2) - No 3-star as it does not have enough edges.
- Node 1: (1, 4, 7) - One 3-star: <1, (4, 7)>.
- Node 2: (2, 0, 5, 7, 8, 9) - Two 3-stars: <2, (0, 7, 8)>, <2, (5, 7, 9)>.
- Node 4: (4, 1, 9) - No 3-star as it does not have enough edges.
- Node 5: (5, 2, 6) - No 3-star as it does not have enough edges.
- Node 6: (6, 5, 7, 8) - One 3-star: <6, (5, 7, 8)>.
- Node 7: (7, 1, 2, 6, 8, 9) - One 3-star: <7, (1, 6, 8)>.
- Node 8: (8, 2, 6, 7) - One 3-star: <8, (2, 6, 7)>.
- Node 9: (9, 2, 4, 7) - One 3-star: <9, (2, 4, 7)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5]. The unique 3-stars found are <1, (4, 7)>, <2, (0, 7, 8)>, <2, (5, 7, 9)>, <6, (5, 7, 8)>, and <7, (1, 6, 8)>.
