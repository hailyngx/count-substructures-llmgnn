Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 4) 

Response:
The graph contains the following 3-star structures:

[<0, (2, 8, 1)>, <2, (0, 8, 7)>, <4, (6, 8, 9)>, <1, (5, 6, 0)>, <6, (1, 2, 4)>, <8, (0, 2, 4)>]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
