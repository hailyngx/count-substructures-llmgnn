Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
The unique 3-stars found in the given graph are:

<0, (6, 1, 3)>
<3, (2, 6, 7)>
<8, (1, 4, 7)>

Thus, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
