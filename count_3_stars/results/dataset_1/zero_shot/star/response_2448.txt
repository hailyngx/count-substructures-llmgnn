Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 3, 7)>
<1, (2, 7, 9)>
<2, (0, 1, 9)>
<4, (6, 7, 8)>
