Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 3-stars present in the given graph. 
The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (7, 8, 8)>
<1, (3, 5, 1)>
<2, (4, 9, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
