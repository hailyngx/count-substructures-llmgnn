Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are listed inside <>:

<0, (2, 1, 8)>
<1, (2, 5, 6)>
<2, (0, 1, 8)>
<3, (1, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
