Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph:
<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<1, (3, 5, 9)>
<2, (4, 8, 9)>
<7, (3, 6, 8)>
