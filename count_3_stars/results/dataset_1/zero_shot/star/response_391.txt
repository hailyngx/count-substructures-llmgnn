Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 8 unique 3-stars in this graph. Here they are:

<0, (3, 5, 9)>
<1, (2, 5, 8)>
<2, (1, 3, 7)>
<2, (3, 4, 8)>
<3, (0, 2, 7)>
<3, (2, 4, 7)>
<3, (4, 8, 9)>
<8, (1, 2, 9)>

Therefore, the final answer is [8].
