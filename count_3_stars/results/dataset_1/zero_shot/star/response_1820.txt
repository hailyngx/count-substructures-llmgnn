Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph has the following unique 3-stars:
    <2, (1, 4, 5)>
    <4, (0, 7, 9)>
    <9, (2, 4, 7)>
    <1, (2, 3, 4)>
    <7, (0, 4, 9)>

Counting these unique 3-stars, we find that there are a total of [5] 3-stars in the graph.
