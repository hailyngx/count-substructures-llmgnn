Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph can be counted by identifying each central node with exactly three leaves connected to it. 

The central nodes with their leaves are: 
- Node 2: (0, 5, 6), (0, 6, 7), (0, 6, 8), (1, 2, 8), (2, 3, 7), (2, 4, 9)
- Node 3: (1, 5, 6), (1, 6, 8), (2, 3, 8), (4, 3, 7)
- Node 4: (1, 7, 8), (1, 7, 9)
- Node 5: (2, 8, 9), (3, 5, 9), (4, 5, 7)
- Node 6: (2, 4, 8), (3, 4, 8) 

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [15]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: 
<2, (0, 5, 6)>, <2, (0, 6, 7)>, <2, (0, 6, 8)>, <2, (1, 2, 8)>, <2, (2, 3, 7)>, <2, (2, 4, 9)>, 
<3, (1, 5, 6)>, <3, (1, 6, 8)>, <3, (2, 3, 8)>, <3, (4, 3, 7)>, 
<4, (1, 7, 8)>, <4, (1, 7, 9)>, 
<5, (2, 8, 9)>, <5, (3, 5, 9)>, <5, (4, 5, 7)>, 
<6, (2, 4, 8)>, <6, (3, 4, 8)>
