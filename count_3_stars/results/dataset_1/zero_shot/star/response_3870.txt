Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be counted by identifying each unique combination of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's proceed to find all 3-stars.

Given the edges:
(0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 7)

Now, let's build the 3-stars:
<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<0, (1, 3, 9)>
<0, (3, 8, 5)>
<0, (9, 7, 5)>
<0, (9, 7, 1)>
<2, (6, 7, 4)>
<7, (2, 6, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
