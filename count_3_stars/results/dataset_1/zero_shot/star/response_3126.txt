Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The 3-stars are:

<0, (3, 4, 7)>
<0, (4, 7, 8)>
<0, (4, 7, 9)>
<4, (0, 1, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
