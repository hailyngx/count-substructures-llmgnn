Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 3, 9)>
<2, (0, 3, 4)>
<6, (1, 7, 9)>
<7, (2, 6, 8)>
