Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 3 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The count in brackets is [3].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<1, (0, 3, 6)>
<6, (1, 4, 9)>
