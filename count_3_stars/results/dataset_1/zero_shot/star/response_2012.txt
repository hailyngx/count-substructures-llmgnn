Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:
[<0, (1, 5, 7)>, <3, (0, 2, 4)>, <4, (3, 5, 7)>, <5, (0, 1, 4)>, <6, (1, 5, 7)>, <7, (0, 4, 6)>]
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
