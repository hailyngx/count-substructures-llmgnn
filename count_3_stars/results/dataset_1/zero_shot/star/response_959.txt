Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The center node of a 3-star graph is the node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's find all the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0 has 2 edges, not a center node.
2. Node 1 has 2 edges, not a center node.
3. Node 2 has 1 edge, not a center node.
4. Node 3 has 4 edges, possible center node.
5. Node 4 has 3 edges, possible center node.
6. Node 5 has 5 edges, possible center node.
7. Node 6 has 3 edges, possible center node.
8. Node 7 has 5 edges, possible center node.
9. Node 8 has 4 edges, possible center node.
10. Node 9 has 2 edges, not a center node.

Therefore, the possible 3-stars in the graph are:
<3, (1, 5, 6)>
<4, (0, 5, 8)>
<5, (0, 1, 3)>
<6, (3, 5, 7)>
<7, (2, 6, 8)>
<8, (4, 5, 7)>

So, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
