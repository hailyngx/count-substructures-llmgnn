Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The graph has the following 3-stars:
- <0, (1, 3, 8)>
- <1, (0, 2, 8)>
- <2, (1, 5, 9)>
- <3, (0, 5, 8)>
- <4, (7, 9, 0)>
- <5, (2, 3, 9)>
- <6, (5, 7, 2)>
- <7, (4, 6, 2)>
- <8, (1, 3, 0)>
- <9, (2, 5, 4)>

Therefore, there are [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
