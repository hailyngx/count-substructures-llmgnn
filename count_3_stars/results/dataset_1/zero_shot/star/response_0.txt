Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
Let's analyze the given graph step by step.

Step 1: Count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.
- Calculating the degree of each node:
    - Node 0: degree = 2
    - Node 1: degree = 2
    - Node 3: degree = 3
    - Node 4: degree = 5
    - Node 6: degree = 2
    - Node 7: degree = 4
    - Node 8: degree = 1
    - Node 9: degree = 1

- As we know, a 3-star involves a center node connected to exactly three other nodes. Nodes 3, 6, 7, 8, and 9 cannot be centers of 3-stars since their degrees are not 3. Only nodes 0 and 1 can be center nodes.

Step 2: Identify the 3-stars centered at nodes 0 and 1.
- For node 0:
    - Node 0 is connected to nodes 3 and no other nodes.
    - This forms a 3-star: <0, (3, 4, 6)>
- For node 1:
    - Node 1 is connected to nodes 4 and 7.
    - This does not form a 3-star since node 1 is connected to 2 nodes and not exactly 3.

Step 3: Determine the number of unique 3-stars found.
- Result: <0, (3, 4, 6)>
- Count of unique 3-stars: [1]

Output: [1]
