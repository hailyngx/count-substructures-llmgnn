Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be counted by identifying the nodes that form 3-stars. Here are the 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<1, (0, 3, 7)>
<2, (8, 9, 0)>
<3, (1, 4, 0)>
<4, (0, 3, 5)>
<5, (4, 7, 0)>
<6, (0, 0, 0)> (Note: Connecting one node to itself does not form a valid 3-star)
<7, (0, 1, 5)>
<8, (2, 9, 0)>
<9, (8, 2, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [9].
