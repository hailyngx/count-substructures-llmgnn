Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
There are 3 3-stars in this graph. Here are the unique 3-stars found: <1, (2, 5, 7)>, <1, (5, 7, 8)>, <1, (7, 8, 9)>.   
Therefore, the final answer is [3].
