Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 7 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The list of unique 3-stars is as follows:

<0, (2, 7, 8)>
<1, (2, 4, 7)>
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<2, (1, 4, 6)>
<2, (3, 4, 8)>
<4, (1, 2, 7)>
<4, (5, 6, 9)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
