Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph.  
The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 7, 9)>
<1, (6, 7, 8)>
<2, (0, 3, 9)>
<6, (1, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
