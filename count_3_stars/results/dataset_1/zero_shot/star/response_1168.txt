Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 3-stars in this graph. Here is the list of unique 3-stars found:
    
    <0, (1, 8, 2)>
    <1, (0, 4, 7)>
    <2, (5, 6, 7)>
    <3, (4, 8, 9)>
    <4, (1, 3, 5)>
    <5, (2, 4, 9)>
    <6, (2, 9, 7)>
    <7, (1, 5, 8)>
    <8, (0, 7, 3)>
    <9, (3, 5, 6)>
