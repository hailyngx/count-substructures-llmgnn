Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are:

- <0, (1, 2, 7)>
- <1, (0, 5, 6)>
- <2, (0, 3, 4)>
- <3, (2, 6, 9)>
- <4, (2, 6, 7)>
- <5, (1, 2, 8)>
- <6, (1, 3, 4)>
- <7, (0, 4, 6)>
- <8, (5, 6, 9)>
- <9, (3, 8,  )>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
