Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (3, 8, 2)>
<2, (3, 5, 4)>
<3, (1, 5, 6)>
<4, (2, 6, 9)>
<5, (3, 6, 7)>
<6, (4, 5, 7)>
<7, (5, 6, 7)>
<8, (1, 3, 2)>
