Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 4, 9)>
<1, (7, 8, -)>
<2, (3, 4, 9)>
<5, (2, 3, 7)>

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
