Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in this graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 5, 3)>
<1, (0, 5, 9)>
<2, (0, 4, 6)>
<9, (1, 3, 6)>
