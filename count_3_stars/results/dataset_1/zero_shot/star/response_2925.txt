Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (3, 9, 1)>
<1, (6, 9, 0)>
<3, (0, 4, 5)>
<6, (1, 3, 7)>
