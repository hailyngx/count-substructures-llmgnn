Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph, represented as follows:

<0, (2, 4, 1)>
<3, (4, 5, 7)>
<1, (2, 6, 8)>
<2, (0, 4, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
