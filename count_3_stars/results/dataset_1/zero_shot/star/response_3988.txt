Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in this graph. The answer is [6].

The 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<1, (0, 4, 8)>
<2, (0, 7, 3)>
<3, (0, 5, 2)>
<4, (1, 7, 8)>
<5, (3, 8, 7)>
