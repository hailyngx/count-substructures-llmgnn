Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 2 unique 3-stars in the provided graph. Here they are:

1. <0, (3, 8, 1)>
2. <2, (1, 9, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
