Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph, which can be listed as follows:

<0, (6, 7, 9)>
<3, (1, 5, 7)>
<4, (7, 8, 9)>
<6, (0, 8, 9)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
