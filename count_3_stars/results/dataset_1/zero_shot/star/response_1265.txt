Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are two 3-stars in the given graph. Here are the unique 3-stars found:
    <0, (6, 8, 9)>
    <1, (3, 5, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
