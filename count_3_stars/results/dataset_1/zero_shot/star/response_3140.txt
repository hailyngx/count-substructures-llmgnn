Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 3) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars present in the given graph is [3].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
