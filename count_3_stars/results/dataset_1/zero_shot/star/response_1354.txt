Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
[4]

The 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<1, (3, 4, 8)>
<8, (0, 1, 4)>
<9, (0, 1, 8)>
