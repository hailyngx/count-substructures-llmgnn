Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

The 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 3, 5)>
<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<2, (3, 4, 8)>
<3, (0, 2, 5)>
<4, (1, 2, 5)>
<5, (3, 4, 9)> 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
