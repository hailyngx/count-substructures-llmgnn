Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 3, 8)>
<0, (3, 2, 8)>
<1, (3, 5, 9)>
<1, (5, 3, 9)>
<2, (0, 3, 4)>
<2, (0, 4, 3)>
<2, (3, 0, 4)>
<2, (4, 0, 3)>
<2, (3, 4, 8)>
<2, (4, 3, 8)>
<3, (0, 2, 4)>
<3, (2, 0, 4)>
<3, (2, 4, 8)>
<3, (4, 2, 8)>
