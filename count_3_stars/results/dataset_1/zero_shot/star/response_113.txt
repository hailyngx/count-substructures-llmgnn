Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 2 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 4, 8)>
<4, (0, 1, 9)>

Therefore, the final answer is [2].
