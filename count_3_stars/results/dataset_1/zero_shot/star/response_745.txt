Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The total number of 3-star subgraphs in the given graph can be determined by counting the number of times each node appears as the central node in a 3-star pattern.

Here are the 3-stars found in the given graph:
<1, (5, 6, 7)>
<2, (4, 6, 6)>
<3, (0, 9, 9)>
<4, (2, 2, 6)>
<5, (1, 9, 9)>
<6, (1, 2, 4)>
<7, (1, 6, 8)>
<8, (7, 7, 7)>
<9, (1, 3, 5)>
<0, (3, 3, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
