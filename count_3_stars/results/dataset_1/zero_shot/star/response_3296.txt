Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 5) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 6) (9, 0) 

Response:
There are two 3-stars in the given graph. Here is the list of unique 3-stars:

<0, (5, 9)>
<5, (0, 2)>
    
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
