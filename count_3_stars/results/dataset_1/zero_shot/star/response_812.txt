Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are a total of [12] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 3, 6)>
<1, (0, 4, 6)>
<4, (1, 3, 8)>
<5, (4, 7, 8)>
<6, (0, 1, 4)>
<7, (0, 5, 8)>
<8, (1, 4, 7)>
<9, (4, 7, 9)>
