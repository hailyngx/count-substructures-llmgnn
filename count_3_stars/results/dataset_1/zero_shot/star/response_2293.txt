Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 6) (3, 0) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The graph has 8, 1, and 0 as the central nodes. 

Finding 3-stars with the central node as 8:
- <8, (0, 1, 6)>
- <8, (0, 1, 6)>
- <8, (0, 6, 1)>
- <8, (0, 6, 1)>

Finding 3-stars with the central node as 1:
- <1, (0, 5, 6)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars: [4]
