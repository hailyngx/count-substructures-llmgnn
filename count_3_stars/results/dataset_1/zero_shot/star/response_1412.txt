Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 3-stars.  

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 3, 5)>
<3, (0, 1, 4)>
<4, (0, 1, 3)>
<5, (0, 3, 6)>
<6, (4, 5, -)>
<7, (0, 2, 9)>
<8, (1, 3, 4)>
<9, (3, 7, -)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [8].
