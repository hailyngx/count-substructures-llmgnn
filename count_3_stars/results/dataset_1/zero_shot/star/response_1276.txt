Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 5, 6)>
<1, (4, 6, 8)>
<2, (0, 4, 9)>
<6, (0, 1, 8)>
