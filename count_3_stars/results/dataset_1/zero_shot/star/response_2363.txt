Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be found by examining the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. In this case, we can identify the unique 3-stars as follows:

<0, (1, 2, 6)>
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<2, (0, 1, 6)>
<3, (1, 5, 6)>
<4, (5, 6, 8)>
<5, (3, 4, 6)>
<6, (0, 2, 3)>
<7, (9, 8, N)>
<8, (6, 9, N)>
<9, (7, 8, N)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
