Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in this graph:  
<0, (4, 5, 6)>  
<1, (2, 3, 7)>  
<2, (0, 1, 8)>  
<4, (0, 6, 9)>  

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
