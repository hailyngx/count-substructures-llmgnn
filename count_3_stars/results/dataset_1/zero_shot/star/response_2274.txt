Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 8) (6, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are [3] 3-stars in the given graph.  
The unique 3-stars are <0, (3, 4, 5)>, <3, (0, 9, 6)>, and <4, (0, 8, 9)>.
