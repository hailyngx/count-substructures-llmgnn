Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [8].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<0, (5, 7, 8)>
<3, (6, 7, 9)>
<3, (7, 6, 9)>
<6, (3, 7, 9)>
<6, (7, 3, 9)>
<7, (0, 5, 9)>
<7, (3, 6, 9)>
