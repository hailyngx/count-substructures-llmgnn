Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are:
[<2, (0, 3, 5)>, <5, (1, 2, 7)>, <6, (1, 4, 7)>, <7, (4, 5, 6)>, <9, (2, 7, 8)>]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
