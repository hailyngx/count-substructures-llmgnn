Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The 3-star graphs found in the given graph are as follows:

- <0, (3, 9, 1)>
- <1, (2, 5, 8)>
- <2, (1, 5, 8)>
- <3, (0, 1, 4)>
- <4, (3, 6, 7)>
- <5, (1, 2, 7)>
- <6, (4, 9, -)>
- <7, (4, 5, -)>
- <8, (1, 2, 3)>
- <9, (0, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
