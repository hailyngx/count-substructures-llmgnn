Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is equal to the count of nodes that can be the center of a 3-star.

From the provided edges, we can identify the possible centers of 3-stars based on the edges they are involved in. The nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes are candidates for being the center of a 3-star. Based on the given edges, the possible center nodes are: 
- Node 2: Connected to nodes 3, 4, 5, 6, and 9
- Node 3: Connected to nodes 2, 6, 7, and 8
- Node 6: Connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 5, and 7
- Node 8: Connected to nodes 0, 3, and 9

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4.

Unique 3-stars:
<2, (3, 4, 5)>
<3, (2, 6, 7)>
<6, (0, 2, 5)>
<8, (0, 3, 9)>
