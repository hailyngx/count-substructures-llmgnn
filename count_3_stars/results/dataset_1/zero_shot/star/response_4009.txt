Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 5, 9)>
<1, (3, 4, 1)>
<2, (0, 4, 9)>
<3, (1, 5, 9)>
<9, (0, 2, 8)>
