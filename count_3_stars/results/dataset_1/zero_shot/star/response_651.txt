Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph.  
The unique 3-stars are:  
<0, (1, 5, 8)>  
<1, (0, 7, 9)>  
<4, (2, 5, 8)>  
<5, (0, 4, 8)>  
<7, (1, 6, 9)>  
<9, (1, 6, 7)>
