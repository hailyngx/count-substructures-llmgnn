Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<1, (3, 4, 5)>
<3, (0, 1, 5)>
<6, (1, 3, 7)>
<6, (8, 9, 0)>
<7, (5, 6, 0)>
<7, (6, 8, 9)>
<9, (6, 8, 3)>
<2, (0, 3, 1)>
<4, (0, 1, 3)>
