Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 5) (4, 1) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.
    
The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (4, 5, 8)>
<2, (0, 7, 2)>
<6, (8, 9, 1)>
<8, (1, 6, 5)>
