Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:
```
0 --- 4          1 --- 6 --- 7
      |          |     |
      |          3     5
      |          |     |
      5          4     |
                       |
                       6
```

To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we first list out all the possible 3-stars by considering each node as the center node:
1. <0, (4, 5, 4)>
2. <1, (3, 6, 6)>
3. <3, (1, 4, 6)>
4. <4, (0, 3, 5)>
5. <5, (4, 6, 6)>
6. <6, (1, 3, 5)>
7. <7, (6, 6, 0)>

Since the graph has no other 3-star configurations, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
