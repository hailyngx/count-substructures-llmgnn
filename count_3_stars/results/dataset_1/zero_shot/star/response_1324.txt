Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<1, (0, 5, 6)>
<2, (1, 8, -)>
<3, (0, 1, 6)>
<4, (0, 8, -)>
<5, (1, 8, -)>
<6, (1, 3, 9)>
