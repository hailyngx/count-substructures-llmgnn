Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

The 3-stars are:
<1, (7, 8, 3)>
<1, (7, 8, 9)>
<1, (7, 3, 5)>
<1, (8, 2, 5)>
<1, (8, 4, 5)>

So, the final answer is [5].
