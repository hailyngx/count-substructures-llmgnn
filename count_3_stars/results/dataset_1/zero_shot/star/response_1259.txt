Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 6 3-stars in the given graph. 

[6]

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 4, 8)>
<1, (0, 3, 5)>
<5, (1, 2, 8)>
<8, (0, 5, 7)>
<7, (8, 9, 1)>
<9, (1, 7, 8)>
