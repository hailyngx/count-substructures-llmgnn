Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 8 unique 3-stars in this graph. 

The 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 6, 9)>
<1, (0, 6, 9)>
<2, (3, 4, 5)>
<3, (2, 7, 5)>
<4, (2, 5, 8)>
<5, (2, 4, 7)>
<6, (1, 2, 9)>
<7, (3, 5, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [8].
