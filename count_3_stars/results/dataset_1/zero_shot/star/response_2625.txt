Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
The graph can be represented visually as follows:

```
    1 --- 2
   /|\  /|\
  0 | \/ | 3
   \|/  |/
    6 --- 7
     \   |
      \  |
         8
        / \
       9   4
          /
         5
```

To find the number of 3-stars, we need to identify the unique 3-stars in the graph.

The 3-stars in this graph are:
<0, (1, 3, 6)>
<1, (0, 2, 6)>
<2, (1, 3, 6)>
<3, (0, 2, 7)>
<4, (5, 6, 9)>
<5, (4, 6, 9)>
<6, (1, 2, 4)>
<7, (3, 8, 9)>
<8, (2, 7, 9)>
<9, (1, 2, 4)>

Counting the number of 3-stars found:

[9]
