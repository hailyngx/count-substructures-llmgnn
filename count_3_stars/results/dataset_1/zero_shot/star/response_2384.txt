Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 7 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

The 3-stars are:
<1, (3, 4, 6)>
<1, (4, 6, 8)>
<1, (3, 6, 8)>
<1, (3, 4, 8)>
<1, (3, 6, 9)>
<1, (4, 6, 9)>
<1, (4, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
