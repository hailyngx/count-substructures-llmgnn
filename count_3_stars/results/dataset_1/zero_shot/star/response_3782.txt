Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [8] 3-stars in the given graph. 

Unique 3-stars: 
<0, (2, 5, 7)>
<0, (2, 7, 8)>
<1, (2, 4, 8)>
<1, (3, 4, 8)>
<1, (3, 4, 9)>
<2, (0, 5, 7)>
<2, (1, 3, 8)>
<4, (1, 6, 8)>
