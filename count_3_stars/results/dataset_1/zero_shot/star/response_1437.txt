Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
    
    <1, (2, 3, 7)>
    <4, (6, 7, 8)>
    <7, (1, 3, 4)>
    <8, (5, 6, 7)>
