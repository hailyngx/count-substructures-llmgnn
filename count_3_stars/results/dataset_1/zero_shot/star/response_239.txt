Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are:
- <0, (4, 7, 9)>
- <1, (4, 5, 6)>
- <4, (0, 1, 8)>
- <5, (1, 2, 7)>
- <8, (4, 5, 9)>
- <9, (0, 4, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
