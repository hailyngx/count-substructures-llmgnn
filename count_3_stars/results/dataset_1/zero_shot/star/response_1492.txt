Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:

[<0, (6, 9)>]
[<1, (5, 6)>]
[<2, (7, 9)>]
[<3, (6, 0)>]
[<4, (5, 7)>]
[<7, (2, 4)>]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
