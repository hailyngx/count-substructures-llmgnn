Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in this graph: 
<1, (2, 5, 7)>
<2, (1, 3, 8)>
<3, (2, 4, 5)>
<8, (1, 2, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
