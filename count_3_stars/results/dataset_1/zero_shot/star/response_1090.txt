Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
There is only one 3-star in the given graph. Therefore, the final answer is [1].

The unique 3-star found in the graph is <0, (1, 7, 8)>.
