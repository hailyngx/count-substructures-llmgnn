Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph can be determined by counting the number of nodes connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's identify the 3-stars present in this graph:

1. <0, (3, 4, 5)>
2. <2, (4, 5, 8)>
3. <3, (0, 6, 8)>
4. <5, (0, 2, 7)>
5. <8, (2, 3, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
