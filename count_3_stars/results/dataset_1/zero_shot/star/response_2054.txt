Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
The unique 3-stars found in the given graph are:

<0, (5, 6, 1)>
<2, (4, 8, 9)> 

There are a total of [2] 3-stars in the graph.
