Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of 3-star structures in the given graph can be calculated by counting the number of nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. In this case, we can observe that nodes 0, 1, 6, and 9 have three connections each, making them the potential central nodes of 3-stars.

The unique 3-stars found in the given graph are:
<0, (1, 3, 6)>
<1, (0, 7, 9)>
<6, (0, 9, 7)>
<9, (0, 1, 6)>

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
