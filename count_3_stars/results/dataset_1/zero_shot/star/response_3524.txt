Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:

[<1, (2, 3, 5)>, <3, (1, 2, 7)>, <5, (1, 4, 8)>, <7, (1, 3, 5)>, <8, (3, 5, 7)>] 

Therefore, there are a total of [5] 3-stars in the graph.
