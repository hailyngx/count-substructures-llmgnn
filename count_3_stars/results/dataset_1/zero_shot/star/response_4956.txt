Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the graph. The answer is [6].
The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (5, 7, 4)>
<2, (1, 4, 5)>
<4, (2, 5, 9)>
<5, (0, 4, 7)>
<6, (8, 9, 4)>
<9, (4, 6, 5)>
