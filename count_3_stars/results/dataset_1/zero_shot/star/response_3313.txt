Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 7, 3)>
<1, (3, 8, 2)>
<3, (1, 4, 9)>
<4, (3, 0, 5)>
<5, (8, 2, 6)>
<7, (0, 4, 9)>
