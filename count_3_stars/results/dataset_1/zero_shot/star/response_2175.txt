Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 2) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are [5] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 5, 7)>
<1, (4, 9, 9)>
<2, (0, 5, 7)>
<4, (1, 9, 9)>
<9, (1, 4, 5)>
