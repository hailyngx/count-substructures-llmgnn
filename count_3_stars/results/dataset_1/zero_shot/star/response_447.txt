Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 5, 9)>
<1, (3, 6, 9)>
<2, (0, 6, 7)>
<3, (1, 9, 6)>
<4, (5, 6, 8)>
<5, (0, 4, 6)>
<6, (1, 2, 4)>
<9, (0, 1, 3)>
