Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [8] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<0, (5, 4, 8)>
<1, (0, 2, 5)>
<1, (2, 3, 0)>
<2, (1, 3, 6)>
<2, (3, 6, 1)>
<3, (2, 6, 7)>
<4, (5, 9, 0)>
