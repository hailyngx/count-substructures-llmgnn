Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be found by identifying the central node and its three adjacent nodes for each 3-star configuration, taking into account that each node can serve as the central node. 

Count of 3-stars: [6]

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (4, 6, 7)>
<1, (2, 6, 8)>
<2, (1, 5, 8)>
<3, (4, 6, 9)>
<4, (0, 3, 9)>
<5, (2, 8, 9)>
