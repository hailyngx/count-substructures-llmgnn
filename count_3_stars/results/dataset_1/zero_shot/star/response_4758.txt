Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [24] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<0, (4, 6, 9)>
<1, (3, 6, 7)>
<3, (1, 4, 6)>
<4, (0, 3, 6)>
<4, (6, 8, 9)>
<6, (0, 1, 2)>
<6, (1, 3, 4)>
<7, (1, 8, 9)>
<8, (4, 5, 7)>
<9, (0, 4, 6)>
<9, (5, 7, 8)>
