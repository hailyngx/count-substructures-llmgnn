Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are three 3-stars in the given graph. Here are the unique 3-stars found: 
    <0, (5, 7, 4)>
    <1, (4, 8, 5)>
    <2, (3, 6, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
