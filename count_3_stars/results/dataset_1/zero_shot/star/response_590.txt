Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph contains the following 3-stars:
\[
\begin{aligned}
&[3] \\
&[1] \\
&[6] \\
&[7] \\
&[0] \\
&[5] \\
&[4] \\
&[9] \\
&[8] \\
\end{aligned}
\]

Therefore, there are a total of [9] 3-stars in the graph.
