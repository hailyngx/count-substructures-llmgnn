Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
The graph contains the following 3-stars: 
<0, (1, 3, 6)>
<1, (0, 4, 6)>
<3, (0, 5, 6)>
<5, (2, 3, 7)>
<6, (0, 1, 3)>
<7, (1, 5, 6)>
<8, (1, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
