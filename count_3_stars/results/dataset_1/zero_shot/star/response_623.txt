Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-star structures in the given graph. The 3-stars are as follows:
<0, (3, 7, 1)>
<1, (9, 4, 7)>
<3, (0, 5, 8)>
<4, (1, 7, 9)>
<5, (3, 6, 9)>
<7, (0, 4, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
