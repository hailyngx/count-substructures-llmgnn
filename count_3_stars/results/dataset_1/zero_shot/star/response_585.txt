Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 9 different 3-star configurations in the given graph. 

The 3-star configurations are:
<0, (1, 7, 8)>
<1, (0, 2, 4)>
<2, (1, 4, 7)>
<3, (4, 8, 9)>
<4, (1, 2, 3)>
<6, (7)>
<7, (0, 2, 4)>
<8, (1, 3, 9)>
<9, (1, 3, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
