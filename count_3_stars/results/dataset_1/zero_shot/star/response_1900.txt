Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are 3 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The count is in brackets: [3].
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (4, 6, 7)>
<1, (3, 5, 6)>
<5, (1, 2, 8)>
