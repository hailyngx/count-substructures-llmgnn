Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:
- Node 0: 4, 5, 7
- Node 1: 9
- Node 2: 7
- Node 3: 9
- Node 4: 0, 6, 8, 9
- Node 5: 0
- Node 6: 4, 7, 9
- Node 7: 0, 2, 6
- Node 8: 4, 9
- Node 9: 1, 3, 4, 6, 8

Now let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph.

The possible 3-stars in this graph are:
<0, (4, 5, 7)>
<4, (0, 6, 8)>
<9, (1, 3, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
