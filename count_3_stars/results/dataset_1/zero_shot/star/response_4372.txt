Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph, and the final answer inside brackets is [5].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 8, 9)>
<1, (0, 4, 5)>
<2, (6, 9, 3)>
<3, (4, 5, 6)>
<4, (1, 3, 5)>
