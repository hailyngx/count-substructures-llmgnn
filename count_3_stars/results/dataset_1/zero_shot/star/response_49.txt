Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
There are a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (9, 2, 1)>
<2, (1, 0, 9)>
<2, (4, 7, 9)>
<2, (9, 0, 1)>
<4, (7, 6, 5)>
<7, (6, 4, 5)>
