Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 5 unique 3-stars in this graph. 

The 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 1, 9)>
<1, (2, 3, 4)>
<2, (1, 4, 9)>
<3, (0, 1, 4)>
<9, (2, 3, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [5].
