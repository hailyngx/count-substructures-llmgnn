Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are [8] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (7, 8, 1)>
<1, (7, 0, 9)>
<2, (7, 4, 6)>
<4, (6, 7, 5)>
<5, (6, 4, 7)>
<6, (4, 5, 9)>
<7, (0, 1, 2)>
<9, (1, 6, 7)>
