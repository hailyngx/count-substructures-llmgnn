Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 6, 9)>
<1, (4, 8, 5)>
<2, (0, 3, 6)>
<4, (1, 8, 5)>
<9, (0, 6, 5)>
