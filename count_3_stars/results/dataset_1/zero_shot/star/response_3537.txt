Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph contains the following 3-stars:
- <0, (2, 3, 7)>
- <1, (3, 5, 8)>
- <2, (0, 8, 3)>
- <3, (0, 1, 5)>
- <5, (1, 3, -)>
- <6, (3, 9, -)>
- <7, (0, -, -)>
- <8, (1, 2, -)>
- <9, (3, 6, -)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
