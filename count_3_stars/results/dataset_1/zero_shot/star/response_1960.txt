Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:
- <0, (2, 6, 6)>
- <1, (8, 9, 1)>
- <2, (0, 4, 2)>
- <6, (0, 3, 9)>
- <8, (1, 5, 8)>
- <9, (1, 6, 1)>

Counting all the unique 3-stars gives us a total of [6].
