Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are four 3-star subgraphs in this given graph. Here is the breakdown of the 3-stars:

[4]

<0, (1, 2, 3)>

<1, (0, 2, 4)>

<2, (0, 1, 5)>

<5, (0, 2, 6)>
