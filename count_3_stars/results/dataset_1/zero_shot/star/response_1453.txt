Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in this graph. Here they are:
   
   1. <0, (4, 6, 2)>
   2. <1, (6, 9, 0)>
   3. <6, (0, 1, 8)>
   4. <9, (1, 5, 0)>
   
   So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
