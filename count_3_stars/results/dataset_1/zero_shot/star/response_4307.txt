Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are:
<0, (1, 2, 7)>
<1, (0, 2, 4)>
<2, (0, 1, 7)>
<7, (0, 2, 3)>
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
