Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:
[<0, (5, 6, 7)>, <1, (2, 7, 8)>, <4, (3, 8, 9)>, <5, (0, 4, 9)>, <6, (0, 3, 6)>, <7, (0, 1, 7)>, <8, (1, 2, 4)>, <9, (4, 5, 9)>]

Therefore, there are 8 unique 3-stars. The final answer is [8].
