Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (0, 5, 2)>
<2, (4, 5, 7)>
<4, (2, 3, 8)>
<8, (9, 6, 7)>
