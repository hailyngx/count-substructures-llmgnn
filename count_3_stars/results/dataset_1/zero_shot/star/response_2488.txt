Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:
[<0, (1, 4, 5)>, <1, (0, 2, 4)>, <2, (1, 3, 6)>, <3, (2, 4, 9)>, <4, (0, 1, 3)>, <5, (0, 7, 8)>, <6, (2, 7, 9)>, <7, (4, 5, 8)>, <8, (4, 7, 9)>, <9, (3, 4, 7)>]
Therefore, there are 10 unique 3-stars in the graph. The final answer is [10].
