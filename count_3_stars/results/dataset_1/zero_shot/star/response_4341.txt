Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
The number of 3-star subgraphs in the given graph can be counted by looking at each node and checking if it is at the center of a 3-star pattern.

Based on the given edges, the 3-star subgraphs are as follows:
- <2, (4, 6, 8)>
- <4, (2, 5, 9)>
- <5, (1, 4, 7)>
- <8, (3, 5, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-star subgraphs in the given graph is [4].
