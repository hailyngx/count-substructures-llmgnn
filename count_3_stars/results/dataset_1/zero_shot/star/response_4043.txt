Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) 

Response:
There are 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the answer is [2].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (3, 4, 6)>
<6, (0, 3, 4)>
