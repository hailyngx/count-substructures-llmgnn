Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-star structures:  
[<0, (1, 2, 4)>, <1, (0, 2, 6)>, <1, (0, 2, 7)>, <1, (0, 2, 8)>, <2, (0, 1, 6)>, <2, (0, 1, 8)>, <2, (0, 1, 7)>, <2, (0, 1, 8)>, <6, (1, 2, 8)>, <8, (1, 2, 6)>]  
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [10].
