Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The number of 3-stars is [5].

<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<0, (7, 9, 4)>
<2, (0, 8, 9)>
<3, (0, 6, 7)>
<4, (1, 6, 7)>
