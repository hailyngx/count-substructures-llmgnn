Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 7) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 3-star patterns in this graph, and the count is [3]. 
The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 7, 9)>
<1, (0, 3, 6)>
<7, (0, 3, 9)>
