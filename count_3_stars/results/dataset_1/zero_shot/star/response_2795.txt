Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].

The unique 3-stars identified in the graph are:
<0, (7, 9, 1)>
<2, (7, 1, 5)>
<3, (5, 8, 9)>
<5, (1, 2, 7)>
<6, (7, 8, 9)>
<7, (0, 2, 4)>
<8, (3, 6, 9)>
<9, (0, 3, 6)>
