Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:

[<2, (3, 7, 9)>, <3, (2, 4, 7)>, <5, (6, 7, 9)>, <6, (5, 7, 9)>, <7, (2, 5, 9)>, <9, (2, 6, 7)>]
