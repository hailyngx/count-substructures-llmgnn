Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph can be found by counting the number of unique 3-stars that can be formed. Let's list down the unique 3-stars:

<0, (1, 3, 7)>
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<2, (1, 8, 8)>
<3, (0, 1, 1)>
<4, (1, 9, 9)>
<5, (6, 6, 6)>
<6, (5, 5, 5)>
<7, (0, 1, 8)>
<8, (1, 2, 7)>
<9, (4, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
