Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (6, 8, 1)>
<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<2, (1, 8, 9)>
<6, (0, 1, 8)>
<8, (0, 2, 6)>
<9, (2, 6, 7)>
