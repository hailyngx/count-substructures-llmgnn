Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 3 unique 3-stars in the given graph.  
The 3-stars are:  
<1, (2, 4, 6)>  
<2, (1, 8, 9)>  
<9, (2, 7, 5)>  

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
