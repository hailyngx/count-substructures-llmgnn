Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are [8] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 6, 8)>
<0, (4, 1, 6)>
<0, (4, 5, 8)>
<0, (6, 2, 8)>
<0, (6, 8, 9)>
<1, (4, 0, 5)>
<1, (4, 5, 8)>
<3, (5, 4, 9)>
