Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in this graph:

[<2, (0, 1, 5)>, <3, (5, 7, 8)>, <5, (3, 8, 9)>, <8, (3, 5, 8)>]
