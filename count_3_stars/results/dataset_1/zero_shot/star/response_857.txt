Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are [8] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 1, 4)>
<1, (4, 2, 8)>
<2, (0, 4, 1)>
<3, (6, 9, 7)>
<4, (1, 2, 8)>
<5, (7, 6, 8)>
<6, (3, 7, 8)>
<7, (5, 8, 6)>
