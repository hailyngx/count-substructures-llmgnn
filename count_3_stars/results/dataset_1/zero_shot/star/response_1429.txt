Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<1, (4, 5, 8)>
<1, (5, 8, 9)>
<3, (0, 2, 8)>
<4, (1, 6, 8)>
<6, (0, 4, 8)>
