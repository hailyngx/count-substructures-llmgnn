Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The given graph contains the following 3-star configurations:

[<0, (2, 3, 8)>, <1, (3, 5, 9)>, <2, (0, 3, 8)>, <3, (1, 2, 5)>, <4, (7, 9, 5)>, <5, (1, 6, 9)>, <6, (8, 5, 2)>, <7, (4, 9, 5)>, <8, (2, 6, 3)>, <9, (1, 5, 4)>]

Therefore, the total number of 3-star configurations in the given graph is [10].
