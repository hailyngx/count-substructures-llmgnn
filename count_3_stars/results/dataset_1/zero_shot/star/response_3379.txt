Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here are the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (4, 5, 8)>
<1, (3, 5, 8)>
<3, (1, 8, 9)>
<5, (0, 1, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
