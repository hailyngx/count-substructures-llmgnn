Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<1, (3, 7, 9)>
<2, (4, 7, 8)>
<3, (0, 1, 8)>
<8, (0, 2, 9)>
