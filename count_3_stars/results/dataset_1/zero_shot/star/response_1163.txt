Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The graph described has the following 3-stars: 
    - <0, (1, 2, 7)>
    - <1, (0, 2, 3)>
    - <2, (0, 1, 5)>
    - <3, (0, 1, 4)>
    - <4, (3, 6, 7)>
    - <5, (1, 2, 9)>
    - <6, (3, 4, 7)>
    - <7, (0, 2, 4)>
    - <9, (4, 5, 7)>

Therefore, there are a total of [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
