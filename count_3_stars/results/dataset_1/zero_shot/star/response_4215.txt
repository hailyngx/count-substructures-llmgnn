Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are 3 three-star structures in this graph.  
Therefore, the answer is [3].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<1, (0, 9, 3)>
<4, (0, 5, 6)>
