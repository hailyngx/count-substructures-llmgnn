Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph has the following edges:
- (0, 6)
- (2, 3)
- (3, 2)
- (3, 7)
- (3, 8)
- (4, 5)
- (5, 4)
- (5, 7)
- (5, 9)
- (6, 0)
- (7, 3)
- (7, 5)
- (7, 9)
- (8, 3)
- (9, 5)
- (9, 7)

Let's now find the 3-stars in this graph:

<0, (6, 7, 9)>
<5, (4, 7, 9)>
<9, (5, 7, 5)>

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is therefore [3].
