Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are four 3-stars in this graph. Here they are:

<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<3, (4, 6, 8)>
<5, (0, 2, 7)>
<7, (0, 2, 4)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
