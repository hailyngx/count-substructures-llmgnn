Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are:
    
    <0, (3, 5, 7)>
    <1, (2, 5, 9)>
    <2, (1, 8, None)>
    <3, (0, 6, 9)>
    <4, (5, 7, None)>
    <5, (0, 1, 4)>
    <6, (3, 5, 9)>
    <7, (0, 4, 5)>
    <8, (2, 9, None)>
    <9, (1, 3, 6)>

    The total number of 3-star graphs is [9].
