Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 3-stars in the given graph, which can be counted as follows: 

[8]

Therefore, the final answer is [1]. 

The unique 3-star found is: <8, (0, 3, 6)>.
