Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 6 total 3-star graphs in the given graph. Here is the list of unique 3-stars found:
- <0, (1, 4, 6)>
- <1, (0, 5, 7)>
- <2, (4, 5, 6)>
- <2, (8, 9, 2)>
- <4, (0, 5, 8)>
- <8, (2, 6, 9)>

Therefore, the final answer is [6].
