Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are listed inside angle brackets:

<0, (2, 6, 7)>
<2, (0, 3, 4)>
<3, (2, 5, 6)>
<8, (5, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
