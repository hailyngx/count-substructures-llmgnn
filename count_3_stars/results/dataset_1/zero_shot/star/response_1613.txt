Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 8, 0)>
<2, (4, 5, 7)>
<3, (5, 9, 3)>
<4, (5, 6, 7)>
