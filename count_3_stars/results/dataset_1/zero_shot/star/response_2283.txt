Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 6) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:
```
0 -- 8
1 -- 4 -- 6
2 -- 4 -- 6
3 -- 6
4 -- 1 -- 2 -- 5 -- 6 -- 7
5 -- 4
6 -- 1 -- 2 -- 3 -- 4 -- 8
7 -- 4
8 -- 0 -- 6
```

There are a total of [2] 3-stars in this graph, which are:
<4, (1, 2, 5)>
<6, (1, 2, 8)>
