Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in this graph. The 3-stars are:

<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<2, (1, 5, 7)>
<3, (1, 6, 0)>
<4, (1, 9, 0)>
<5, (1, 2, 9)>
<6, (1, 9, 1)>

Therefore, the final answer is [6].
