Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 5, 9)>
<1, (2, 7, 8)>
<2, (0, 1, 7)>
<7, (1, 2, 9)>
