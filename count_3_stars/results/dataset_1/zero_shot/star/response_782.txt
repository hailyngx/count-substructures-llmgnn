Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph contains the following 3-stars:
[<0, (1, 4, 7)>, <1, (0, 4, 6)>, <3, (1, 4, 9)>, <4, (0, 1, 2)>, <5, (4, 6, 9)>, <6, (1, 5, 8)>, <7, (4, 9, 1)>, <8, (3, 6, 9)>, <9, (3, 5, 7)>]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
