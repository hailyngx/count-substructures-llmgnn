Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be calculated by examining all possible combinations of nodes that satisfy the definition of a 3-star graph. 

First, let's list down the nodes and their corresponding neighbors:
- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 3, 8, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {1, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 1, 4, 7}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 2, 3, 7}
- Node 5: Neighbor {2}
- Node 6: Neighbor {5}
- Node 7: Neighbors {2, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 1}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 1, 7}

Now, we can see the 3-stars in this graph:
<0, (1, 3, 8)>
<1, (0, 3, 8)>
<1, (0, 3, 9)>
<1, (2, 4, 8)>
<1, (2, 4, 9)>
<2, (1, 4, 5)>
<3, (0, 1, 4)>
<3, (0, 1, 7)>
<4, (1, 2, 3)>
<4, (1, 2, 7)>
<7, (2, 3, 4)>
<7, (2, 4, 9)>
<8, (0, 1, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [13].
