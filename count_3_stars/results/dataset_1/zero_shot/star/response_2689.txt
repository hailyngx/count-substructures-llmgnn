Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The central nodes of the 3-stars can be any nodes except nodes 4, 5, and 9 since they already have degree 4. Let's count the 3-stars with their respective central nodes.

1. (0, 1, 6) -> <0, (4, 6, 9)>
2. (0, 7, 8) -> <0, (6, 7, 9)>
3. (1, 0, 7) -> <1, (3, 5, 7)>
4. (1, 2, 8) -> <1, (3, 5, 8)>
5. (2, 3, 4) -> <2, (5, 8, 4)>
6. (2, 6, 7) -> <2, (5, 6, 8)>
7. (3, 2, 9) -> <3, (1, 4, 9)>
8. (7, 0, 5) -> <7, (1, 5, 9)>
9. (8, 1, 6) -> <8, (2, 4, 6)>

Therefore, there are [9] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
