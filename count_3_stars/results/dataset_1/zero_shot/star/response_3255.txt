Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 2 three-star subgraphs in the given graph. 

The three-star subgraphs are:
<0, (1, 3, 8)>
<3, (4, 0, 9)>

Therefore, the final answer is [2].
