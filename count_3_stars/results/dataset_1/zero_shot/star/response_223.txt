Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are a total of [8] 3-star subgraphs in the given graph. Here are the unique 3-stars found:

<0, (1, 4, 9)>
<1, (0, 2, 8)>
<2, (1, 5, 8)>
<3, (5, 9, 6)>
<4, (0, 7, 8)>
<5, (2, 3, 9)>
<6, (8, 9, 3)>
<8, (1, 4, 5)>
