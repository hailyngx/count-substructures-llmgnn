Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<2, (0, 4, 7)>
<3, (1, 4, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
