Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 3 occurrences of 3-stars in the given graph. The unique 3-stars are:

<1, (2, 8, 8)>
<3, (4, 6, 9)>
<4, (3, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
