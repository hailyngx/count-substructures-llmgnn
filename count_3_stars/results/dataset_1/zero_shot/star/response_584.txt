Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<2, (6, 3, 6)>
<5, (0, 8, 8)>
<8, (5, 9, 9)>

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
