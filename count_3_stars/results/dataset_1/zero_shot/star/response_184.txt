Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.  
The unique 3-stars are:  
<0, (3, 7, 9)>  
<2, (3, 6, 9)>  
<3, (0, 2, 5)>  
<6, (2, 4, 7)>
