Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 0) 

Response:
There are 6 3-stars in the given graph. The unique 3-stars are:

<0, (1, 2, 6)>
<1, (0, 5, 6)>
<2, (0, 3, 4)>
<3, (2, 7, 8)>
<5, (1, 6, 7)>
<6, (0, 1, 5)>

Therefore, the final answer is [6].
