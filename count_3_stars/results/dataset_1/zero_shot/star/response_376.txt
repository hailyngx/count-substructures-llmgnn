Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (4, 6, 5)>
<1, (3, 6, 8)>
<2, (7, 6, 7)>
<3, (1, 8, 9)>
<4, (6, 0, 5)>
<5, (4, 6, 4)>
<6, (1, 4, 7)>
<7, (2, 6, 6)>
<8, (3, 9, 1)>
<9, (3, 8, 3)>
