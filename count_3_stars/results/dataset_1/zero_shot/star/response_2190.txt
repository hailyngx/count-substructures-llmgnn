Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 3 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the answer is [3].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (6, 7, 9)>
<1, (6, 8, --)>
<2, (3, 5, --)>
