Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 1) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 2) 

Response:
There are 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
The 3-stars are <0, (1, 2, 3)> and <2, (0, 1, 7)>.
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
