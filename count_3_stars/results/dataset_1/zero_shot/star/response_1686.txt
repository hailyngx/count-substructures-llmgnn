Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (5, 8, 2)>
<1, (3, 7, 2)>
<2, (5, 7, 8)>
<7, (1, 3, 2)>
