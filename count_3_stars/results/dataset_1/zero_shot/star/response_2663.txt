Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are as follows:

1. <0, (2, 8, 1)>
2. <1, (4, 5, 7)>
3. <2, (0, 8, 1)>
4. <3, (4, 9, 6)>
5. <4, (1, 3, 6)>
6. <5, (1, 4, 7)>
7. <6, (4, 9, 3)>
8. <7, (1, 5, 8)>
9. <8, (0, 2, 1)>
10. <9, (3, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
