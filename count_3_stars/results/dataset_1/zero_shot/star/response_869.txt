Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are as follows: 
<0, (1, 2, 7)>
<2, (0, 1, 5)>
<2, (0, 1, 6)>
<2, (1, 0, 6)>
<6, (2, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
