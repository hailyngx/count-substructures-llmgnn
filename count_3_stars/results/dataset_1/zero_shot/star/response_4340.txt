Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph. The unique 3-stars are <0, (5, 7, 1)>, <3, (4, 6, 8)>, <5, (0, 1, 6)>, and <7, (0, 4, 3)>.
