Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph can be visualized as follows:

```
   0 --- 2 --- 4 --- 9
   |     |     |     |
   5 --- 1     5     8
         |   / |   / |
         7 -   6 -   3
```

There are six 3-stars in this graph, and they are:
1. <0, (2, 5, 1)>
2. <2, (0, 4, 5)>
3. <4, (2, 5, 9)>
4. <5, (0, 2, 4)>
5. <6, (3, 8, 6)>
6. <8, (6, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
