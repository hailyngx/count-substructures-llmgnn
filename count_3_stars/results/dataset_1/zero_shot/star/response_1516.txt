Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 6 different 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are:

<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<1, (2, 7, 8)>
<2, (1, 6, 6)>
<3, (4, 6, 7)>
<4, (0, 3, 9)>
<6, (0, 2, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
