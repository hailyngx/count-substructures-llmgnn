Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are total 4 unique 3-stars in this graph. The list of the 3-stars are as follows:

<0, (1, 9, 5)>
<1, (0, 3, 5)>
<2, (4, 5, 6)>
<6, (3, 5, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4].
