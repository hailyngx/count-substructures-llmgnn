Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 5) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) 

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are:
<0, (5, 2, 8)>
<5, (0, 2, 8)>
<8, (5, 7, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
