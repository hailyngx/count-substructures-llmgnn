Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:
```
0 --- 6
|     |
7     2
|     |
9 --- 5 --- 4 --- 3 --- 8
        |     |
        7     5
        |     |
        9 --- 4
```

To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars present.

1. 3-star with node 0 as the center: (0, 6, 7), (0, 6, 9), (0, 7, 9)
2. 3-star with node 1 as the center: (1, 7, 9)
3. 3-star with node 2 as the center: (2, 5, 6)
4. 3-star with node 3 as the center: (3, 4, 5), (3, 4, 8), (3, 5, 8)
5. 3-star with node 4 as the center: (4, 3, 5), (4, 3, 8), (4, 5, 8), (4, 5, 7), (4, 5, 9), (4, 7, 9)
6. 3-star with node 5 as the center: (5, 2, 6), (5, 2, 7), (5, 2, 8), (5, 3, 4), (5, 3, 8), (5, 4, 7), (5, 4, 8), (5, 6, 7), (5, 7, 8)
7. 3-star with node 6 as the center: (6, 0, 2), (6, 0, 5), (6, 2, 5), (6, 5, 7)
8. 3-star with node 7 as the center: (7, 0, 1), (7, 0, 4), (7, 0, 5), (7, 1, 9), (7, 4, 5), (7, 5, 9)
9. 3-star with node 8 as the center: (8, 3, 4), (8, 3, 5), (8, 3, 9), (8, 4, 5), (8, 4, 9)
10. 3-star with node 9 as the center: (9, 0, 1), (9, 0, 4), (9, 0, 8), (9, 1, 7), (9, 4, 7), (9, 4, 8)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [25].  
Unique 3-stars: <0, (6, 7, 9)>, <1, (7, 9)>, <2, (5, 6)>, <3, (4, 5, 8)>, <4, (5, 7, 9)>, <5, (6, 7)>, <6, (0, 2)>, <7, (0, 5)>, <8, (3, 4)>, <9, (0, 1)>
