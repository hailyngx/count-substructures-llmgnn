Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

```
0 --- 1     7
|     |     
|     |
4     5
|
6

Based on the definition of a 3-star graph, where the center node is connected to exactly three other nodes, the 3-stars in the graph are as follows:

<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<3, (1, 4, 5)>
<6, (2, 0, 8)>
<8, (0, 2, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
