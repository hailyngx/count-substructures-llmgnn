Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The 3-stars are as follows:

<0, (2, 3, 6)>
<2, (0, 3, 4)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<5, (1, 2, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
