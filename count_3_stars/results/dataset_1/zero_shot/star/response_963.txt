Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are a total of 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph, as shown below:

1. <0, (3, 8, 9)>
2. <1, (7, 8, 2)>
3. <2, (1, 4, 9)>
4. <3, (0, 7, 8)>
5. <4, (2, 6, 9)>
6. <5, (6, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the final answer is [6].
