Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are three 3-stars in the given graph. The unique 3-stars are <0, (5, 7, 8)>, <2, (5, 7, 8)>, and <6, (1, 4, 7)>. Therefore, the final answer is [3].
