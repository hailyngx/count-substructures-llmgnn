Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 3 unique 3-stars in the given graph: 
<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<2, (4, 6, 9)>
<3, (0, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
