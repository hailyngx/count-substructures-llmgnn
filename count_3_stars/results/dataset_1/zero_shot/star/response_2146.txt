Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are:

<0, (4, 3, 7)>
<1, (3, 7, 4)>
<2, (9, 8, 1)>
<8, (9, 2, 1)>

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
