Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the graph can be calculated by looking at each node and counting how many 3-stars it is a part of. 
Let's go through each node one by one:

For node 0:
- <0, (4, 6, 8)>
- Total: 1

For node 1:
- <1, (6, 8, 0)>
- Total: 1

For node 2:
- <2, (4, 6, 0)>
- Total: 1

For node 3:
- No 3-star

For node 4:
- <4, (0, 2, 6)>
- Total: 1

For node 5:
- No 3-star

For node 6:
- <6, (0, 1, 2)>
- <6, (0, 8, 9)>
- Total: 2

For node 7:
- No 3-star

For node 8:
- <8, (0, 1, 6)>
- Total: 1

For node 9:
- No 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6]. The unique 3-stars found are <0, (4, 6, 8)>, <1, (6, 8, 0)>, <2, (4, 6, 0)>, <4, (0, 2, 6)>, <6, (0, 1, 2)>, <6, (0, 8, 9)>.
