Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:
[<0, (3, 4, 9)>, <2, (5, 8, 9)>] 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
