Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

```
0 --- 4     7
|     |   / | 
|     | /   |
1 --- 9     3
|         /
|       /
2 --- 5 --- 6
```

To count the number of 3-stars, we first identify the nodes that form 3-stars. Based on the definition of a 3-star graph, a 3-star must have a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

From the given graph, the possible 3-stars are:
1. <0, (1, 4, 7)>
2. <1, (0, 4, 9)>
3. <4, (0, 1, 9)>
4. <7, (0, 1, 3)>
5. <9, (1, 4, -)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
