Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:
1. <0, (2, 9, 9)>
2. <1, (4, 5, 9)>
3. <2, (0, 4, 5)>
4. <3, (5, 6, 8)>
5. <4, (1, 2, 5)>
6. <5, (1, 2, 3)>
7. <6, (2, 3, 7)>
8. <7, (3, 6, 9)>
9. <8, (3, 6, 8)>
10. <9, (0, 1, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
