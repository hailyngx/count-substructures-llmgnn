Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The 3-stars in this graph are:
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<3, (2, 6, 8)>
<4, (0, 1, 6)>
<4, (1, 6, 8)>
<4, (6, 8, 9)>
<8, (3, 5, 9)>
<9, (4, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
