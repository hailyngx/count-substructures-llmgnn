Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The answer is [4].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (5, 7, 9)>
<1, (3, 7, 4)>
<3, (1, 4, 8)>
<9, (0, 5, 6)>
