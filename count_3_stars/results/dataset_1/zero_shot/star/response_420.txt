Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are a total of [4] 3-stars in the given graph.

<0, (5, 8, 1)>
<2, (1, 4, 8)>
<3, (6, 8, 9)>
<6, (3, 4, 7)>
