Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 8) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 3-star graphs in this given graph, and the count is [4].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 3, 9)>
<1, (0, 9, 2)>
<2, (5, 9, 1)>
<5, (2, 8, 9)>
