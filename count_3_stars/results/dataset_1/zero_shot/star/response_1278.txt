Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 2) (9, 1) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:
[<0, (5, 2, 8)>, <1, (3, 2, 9)>, <2, (3, 5, 8)>, <3, (1, 2, 6)>, <6, (3, 7, 6)>, <7, (1, 6, 7)>]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
