Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 9) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
There are 3 3-stars in the given graph. 
The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 4, 9)>
<4, (0, 5, 6)>
<8, (6, 7, 8)>
Therefore, the final answer is [3].
