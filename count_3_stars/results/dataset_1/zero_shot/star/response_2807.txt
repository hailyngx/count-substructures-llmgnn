Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars present in the given graph.

The 3-stars are:
<0, (8, 1, 3)>
<1, (6, 8, 9)>
<2, (9, 4, 6)>
<3, (8, 0, 1)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
