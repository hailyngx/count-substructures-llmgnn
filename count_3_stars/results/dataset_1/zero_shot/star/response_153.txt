Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [9] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars:
<1, (5, 7, 8)>
<2, (5, 6, 7)>
<4, (6, 8, 5)>
<5, (1, 2, 8)>
<6, (2, 4, 8)>
<7, (1, 2, 8)>
<8, (1, 5, 7)>
<8, (4, 5, 7)>
<8, (1, 4, 5)>
