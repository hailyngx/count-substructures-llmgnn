Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 6) (3, 1) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 3 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The count is [3].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 6, 2)>
<1, (3, 5, 8)>
<6, (5, 8, 0)>
