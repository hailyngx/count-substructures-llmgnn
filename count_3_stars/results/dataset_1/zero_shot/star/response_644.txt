Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The list of unique 3-stars is as follows: 
    <0, (4, 5, 7)>
    <2, (3, 7, 5)>
    <4, (0, 8, 7)>
    <5, (0, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
