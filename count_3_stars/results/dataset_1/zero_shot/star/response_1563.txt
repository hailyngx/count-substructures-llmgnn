Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
The unique 3-stars in the given graph are:
<0, (2, 1, 8)>
<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<2, (0, 1, 5)>
<5, (2, 3, 4)>
<6, (1, 2, 8)>
<7, (5, 9, 9)>
