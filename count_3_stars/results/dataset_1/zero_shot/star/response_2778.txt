Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are a total of [3] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 4, 7)>
<2, (1, 5, 6)>
<8, (3, 4, 2)>
