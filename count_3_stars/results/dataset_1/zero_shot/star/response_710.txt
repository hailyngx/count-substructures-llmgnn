Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [9] 3-stars in the given graph.

<2, (0, 4, 5)>
<3, (0, 5, 8)>
<4, (1, 2, 5)>
<5, (0, 1, 2)>
<6, (8, 7, 9)>
<7, (1, 4, 5)>
