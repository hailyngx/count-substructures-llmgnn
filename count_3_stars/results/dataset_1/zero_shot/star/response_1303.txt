Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph, which can be shown below:

<0, (2, 6, 7)>
<1, (2, 3, 5)>
<2, (0, 1, 8)>
<3, (1, 4, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
