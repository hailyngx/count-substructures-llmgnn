Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<1, (0, 2, 6)>
<2, (1, 3, 8)>
<6, (1, 3, 8)>
