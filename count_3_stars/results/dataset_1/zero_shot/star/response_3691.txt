Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph:
<0, (1, 7, 8)>
<1, (0, 4, 5)>
<2, (3, 5, 9)>
<3, (2, 4, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
