Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 distinct 3-stars in this graph. 
Output: <0, (4, 5, 8)>, <0, (4, 5, 9)>, <2, (5, 6, 7)>, <4, (0, 1, 3)>
Count: [4]
