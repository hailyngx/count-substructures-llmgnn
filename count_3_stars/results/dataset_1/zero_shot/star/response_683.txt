Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are a total of [4] 3-star subgraphs in the given graph, and they are as follows:
  
<0, (3, 6, 7)>
<2, (3, 5, 6)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<6, (0, 1, 2)>
