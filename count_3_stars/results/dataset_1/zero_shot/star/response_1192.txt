Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (4, 2, 7)>
<1, (5, 3, 8)>
<2, (4, 6, 9)>
<3, (5, 6, 1)>
<4, (0, 2, 5)>
<8, (1, 5, 6)>
