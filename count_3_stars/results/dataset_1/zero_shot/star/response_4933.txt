Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

The 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 7, 9)>
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<5, (1, 4, 6)>
<6, (1, 3, 5)>
