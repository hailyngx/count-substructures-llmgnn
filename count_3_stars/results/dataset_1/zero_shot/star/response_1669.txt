Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [3] 3-stars in the given graph.  
The unique 3-stars are <0, (1, 4, 5)>, <5, (3, 4, 6)>, <9, (1, 2, 8)>.
