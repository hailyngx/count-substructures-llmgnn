Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) 

Response:
There are three 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are:

<0, (1, 4, 8)>
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<3, (1, 5, 6)>

Therefore, the final answer is [3].
