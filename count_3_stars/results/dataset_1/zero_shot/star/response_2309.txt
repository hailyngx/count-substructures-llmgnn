Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 7, 8)>
<3, (0, 4, 6)>
<5, (6, 7, 8)>
<6, (3, 5, 9)>
<7, (0, 4, 5)>
<8, (1, 3, 7)>
