Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are listed below:
  
<0, (5, 8, 9)>
<1, (6, 7, 2)>
<2, (3, 6, 9)>
<3, (2, 5, 7)>
<4, (5, 7, 8)>
<5, (0, 3, 4)>
<6, (1, 2, 8)>
<7, (1, 3, 4)>
