Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are two 3-stars in the given graph. Here is the list of unique 3-stars with their central node and leaves: 

<0, (2, 5, 6)>  
<6, (0, 2, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
