Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are listed within <> brackets:
<0, (3, 4, 8)>
<1, (2, 5, 7)>
<2, (1, 3, 4)>
<3, (0, 2, 6)>

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
