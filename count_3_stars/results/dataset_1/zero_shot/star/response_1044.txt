Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 different 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 2, 8)>
<1, (0, 4, 5)>
<2, (0, 6, 8)>
<3, (7, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
