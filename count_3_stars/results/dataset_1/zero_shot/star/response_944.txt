Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 6) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
The 3-star configurations in this graph are as follows:
[6]  
<0, (3, 9, 2)>
<1, (4, 6, 5)>
<2, (3, 5, 9)>
<3, (0, 2, 5)>
<4, (1, 5, 6)>
<5, (2, 4, 9)>
<6, (1, 7, 4)>
<9, (0, 5, 9)>

Therefore, there are a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
