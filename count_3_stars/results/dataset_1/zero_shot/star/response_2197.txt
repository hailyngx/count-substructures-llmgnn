Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 3 distinct 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are:

<0, (4, 1, 3)>
<6, (4, 7, 4)>
<5, (8, 3, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
