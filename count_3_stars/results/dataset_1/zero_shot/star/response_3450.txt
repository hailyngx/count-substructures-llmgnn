Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (3, 6, 7)>
<1, (2, 4, 8)>
<3, (0, 5, 9)>
<4, (1, 5, 7)>
<5, (3, 4, 9)>
<6, (0, 9, 7)>
<7, (0, 1, 4)>
<9, (3, 5, 6)>
<2, (1, 8, 0)>
<8, (1, 2, 0)>
<0, (6, 7, 3)>
<1, (8, 2, 4)>
<3, (9, 5, 0)>
<4, (7, 1, 5)>
<5, (9, 3, 4)>
