Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are listed:

<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<1, (2, 4, 8)>
<2, (0, 1, 9)>
<4, (0, 1, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
