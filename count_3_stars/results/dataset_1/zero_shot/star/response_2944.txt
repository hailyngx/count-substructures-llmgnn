Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<5, (0, 8, 9)>
<6, (0, 3, 8)>
<8, (1, 5, 6)>
