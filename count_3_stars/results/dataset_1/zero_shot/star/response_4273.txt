Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
There are [8] 3-stars in the given graph.

<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<0, (4, 1, 5)>
<0, (5, 4, 6)>
<0, (7, 1, 5)>
<1, (0, 9, 4)>
<4, (0, 1, 5)>
<5, (0, 6, 7)>
<7, (0, 3, 6)>
