Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph.

<0, (5, 7, 0)>
<1, (2, 9, 1)>
<1, (3, 9, 1)>
<2, (1, 9, 2)>
<3, (1, 9, 3)>
<7, (6, 8, 7)>
