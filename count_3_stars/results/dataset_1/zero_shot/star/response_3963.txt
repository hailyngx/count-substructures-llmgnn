Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
    
    <0, (1, 5, 6)>
    <1, (0, 3, 4)>
    <2, (0, 4, 5)>
    <3, (1, 7, 8)>
    <4, (1, 2, 6)>
    <5, (0, 2, 9)>
    <6, (0, 4, 8)>
    <8, (1, 2, 9)>
