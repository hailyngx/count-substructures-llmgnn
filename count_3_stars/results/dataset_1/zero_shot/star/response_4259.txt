Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
Here they are: 
<1, (4, 5, 7)>
<3, (4, 5, 7)>
<4, (1, 3, 5)>
<5, (1, 4, 6)>
<5, (2, 4, 8)>
<5, (6, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the final answer is [6].
