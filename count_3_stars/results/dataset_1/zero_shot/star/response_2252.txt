Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in this graph. Here is the list of those 3-stars:
    
    <0, (1, 3, 7)>
    <1, (0, 6, 7)>
    <3, (0, 2, 8)>
    <6, (1, 2, 4)>
    
So the total number of 3-stars is [4].
