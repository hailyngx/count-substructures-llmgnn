Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) 

Response:
There are two 3-stars in the given graph. Here are the unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<2, (6, 7, 5)>
So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
