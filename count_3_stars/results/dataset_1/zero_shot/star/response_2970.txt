Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (2, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 3) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are as follows:
[<0, (1, 2, 4)>, <3, (6, 7, 8)>, <5, (4, 9, 0)>]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
