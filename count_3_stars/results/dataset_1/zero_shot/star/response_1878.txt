Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 3) 

Response:
There are 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph:
<1, (0, 6, 2)>
<3, (4, 8, 7)>
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
