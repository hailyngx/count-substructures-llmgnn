Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are [3] 3-stars in the given graph.
Unique 3-stars: 
<0, (4, 5, 7)>
<1, (2, 3, 4)>
<3, (1, 4, 5)>
