Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph can be visualized as follows:

```
0 --- 1
|     | \
|     |  5
|     | /
3 --- 8 --- 9
|     | \
|     |  2
|     | /
4 --- 6
|
7
```

In this graph, we can identify the following 3-stars:
1. <1, (0, 3, 5)>
2. <3, (5, 6, 8)>
3. <4, (6, 7, 9)>
4. <6, (4, 3, 9)>
5. <8, (1, 3, 9)>
6. <9, (2, 6, 8)>

Therefore, there are a total of 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The answer is [6].
