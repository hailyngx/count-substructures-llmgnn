Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 different 3-stars in the given graph. So, the count of 3-stars is [4].
  
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 5, 8)>
<2, (0, 1, 4)>
<3, (1, 4, 6)>
<4, (2, 3, 5)>
