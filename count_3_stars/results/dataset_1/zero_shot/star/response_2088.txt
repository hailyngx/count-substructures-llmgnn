Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in this graph. The final answer is [4].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<1, (0, 6, 8)>
<2, (0, 6, 7)>
<8, (0, 1, 3)>
