Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 3) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 4, 8)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
