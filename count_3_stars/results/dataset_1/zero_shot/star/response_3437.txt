Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are: 
<0, (3, 9, 1)>
<1, (3, 5, 7)>
<2, (4, 6, 7)>
<3, (0, 1, 6)>
<4, (2, 7, 9)>
<5, (1, 7, 0)>
<6, (1, 2, 9)>
<7, (1, 2, 5)>
<9, (0, 2, 4)>

Count = [9]
