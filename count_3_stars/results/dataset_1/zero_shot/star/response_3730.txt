Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The total number of 3-stars is [5].

Unique 3-stars:
<1, (4, 7, 9)>
<3, (4, 5, 9)>
<4, (1, 3, 5)>
<5, (0, 3, 4)>
<8, (4, 5, 6)>
