Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph has a total of 10 nodes and 26 edges. To find the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern, which consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes.

After examining the edges, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. <0, (6, 9, 1)>
2. <1, (6, 9, 2)>
3. <2, (1, 7, 9)>
4. <3, (5, 7, 9)>
5. <5, (3, 6, 8)>
6. <6, (0, 1, 5)>
7. <7, (2, 3, 9)>
8. <9, (0, 1, 2)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
