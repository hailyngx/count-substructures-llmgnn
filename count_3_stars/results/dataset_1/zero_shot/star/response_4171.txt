Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 5 unique 3-star structures in the given graph. Here they are:

<0, (4, 7, 9)>
<2, (3, 6, 8)>
<3, (2, 6, 8)>
<5, (7, 0, 4)>
<5, (7, 6, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
