Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 5) (3, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
The 3-stars are <0, (6, 7, 9)> and <6, (0, 4, 7)>.
Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
