Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 10 nodes and 38 edges in the given graph. To count the number of 3-stars, we need to identify the 3-stars in the graph.

Let's list the 3-stars present in the graph:
<0, (5, 8, 9)>
<1, (6, 9, 0)>
<2, (4, 6, 9)>
<3, (6, 8, 9)>
<4, (2, 8, 9)>
<5, (0, 7, 8)>
<6, (1, 2, 9)>
<7, (5, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 3, 4)>
<9, (0, 1, 2)>

Thus, there are a total of [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
