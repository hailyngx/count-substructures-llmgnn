Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 0) (4, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (3, 6, 7)>
<1, (6, 8, 9)>
