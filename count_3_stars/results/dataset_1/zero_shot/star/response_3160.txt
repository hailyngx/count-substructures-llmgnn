Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be found by counting all the possible combinations where a node acts as the center of a 3-star.

Given the graph with 10 nodes and 32 edges, the unique 3-stars present in the graph are:
<0, (5, 7, 8)>
<1, (6, 8, 9)>
<2, (7, 8, 3)>
<3, (4, 8, 7)>
<4, (3, 7, 5)>
<5, (0, 7, 8)>
<6, (1, 8, 9)>
<7, (0, 2, 4)>
<8, (0, 1, 2)>
<9, (1, 5, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
