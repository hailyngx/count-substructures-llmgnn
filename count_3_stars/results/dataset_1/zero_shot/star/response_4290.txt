Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<2, (3, 8, 9)>
<3, (0, 2, 8)>
<7, (1, 6, 9)>
