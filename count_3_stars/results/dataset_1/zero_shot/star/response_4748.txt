Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here is the list of those 3-stars:
<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<1, (2, 8, 8)>
<2, (1, 7, 8)>
<8, (1, 4, 9)>

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
