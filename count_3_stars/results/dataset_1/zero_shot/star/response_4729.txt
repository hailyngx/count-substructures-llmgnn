Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are:

- <0, (5, 6, 7)>
- <0, (5, 6, 8)>
- <0, (5, 6, 9)>
- <2, (7, 8, 9)>
- <2, (8, 5, 7)>
- <2, (8, 5, 9)>

Therefore, there are 6 3-stars in the given graph.  
The final answer is [6].
