Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 3, 7)>
<0, (2, 7, 8)>
<0, (2, 7, 9)>
<2, (0, 4, 6)>
<2, (4, 6, 9)>
