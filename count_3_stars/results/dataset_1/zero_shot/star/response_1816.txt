Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (4, 7, 9)>
<4, (2, 6, 7)>
<8, (0, 5, 6)>
<9, (2, 4, 8)>
<0, (8, 6, 5)>
