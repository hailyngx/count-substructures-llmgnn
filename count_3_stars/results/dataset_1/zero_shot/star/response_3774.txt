Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars in the graph are:
<0, (1, 3, 8)>
<1, (0, 7, 8)>
<3, (0, 4, 5)>
<5, (3, 8, 9)>
<7, (1, 2, -)>
<8, (0, 1, 5)>
