Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are [2] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (4, 6, 7)>
<1, (2, 3, 6)>
