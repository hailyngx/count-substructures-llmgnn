Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are 4 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (0, 5, 6)>
<2, (4, 8, 9)>
<5, (1, 2, 7)>
<4, (2, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
