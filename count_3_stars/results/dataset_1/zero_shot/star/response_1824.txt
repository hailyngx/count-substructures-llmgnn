Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 4) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 5, 6)>
<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<1, (4, 5, 6)>
<3, (5, 8, 9)>
<4, (5, 8, 9)>
