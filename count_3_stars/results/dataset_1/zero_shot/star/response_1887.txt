Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 3) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are:

<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<1, (0, 6, 9)>
<2, (3, 9, 0)>
<3, (0, 2, 5)>
<9, (1, 2, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
