Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are as follows:

<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<1, (3, 5, 7)>
<2, (0, 3, 5)>
<3, (1, 2, 8)>
<4, (0, 6, 7)>
<5, (1, 2, 6)>
<6, (4, 5, 9)>
<7, (1, 4, 9)>
<8, (3, 4, N)>
<9, (5, 6, 7)>

Therefore, there are 9 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The final answer is [9].
