Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) 

Response:
There are 3 unique 3-stars in the given graph.

The 3-stars are:
<2, (6, 8, 9)>
<5, (0, 6, 8)>
<6, (2, 5, 8)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
