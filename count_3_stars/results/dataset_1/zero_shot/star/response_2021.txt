Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:
[<0, (3, 6, 8)>, <1, (6, 8, 9)>, <2, (3, 4, 9)>, <6, (0, 1, 5)>, <9, (2, 7, 8)>]
Therefore, there are 5 unique 3-stars in this graph, which can be represented as [5].
