Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 8) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (5, 8, 1)>
<1, (4, 8, 9)>
<2, (4, 8, 1)>
<3, (4, 8, 1)>
<4, (1, 2, 3)>
<8, (1, 2, 3)>
