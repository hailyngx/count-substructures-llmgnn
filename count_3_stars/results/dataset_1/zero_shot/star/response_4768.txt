Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 3, 5)>
<2, (0, 1, 4)>
