Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The count of 3-stars in the graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars are:
<3, (4, 6, 7)>
<4, (3, 7, 5)>
<5, (0, 6, 7)>
<7, (3, 4, 5)>
