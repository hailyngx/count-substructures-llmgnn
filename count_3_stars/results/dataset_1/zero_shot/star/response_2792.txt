Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:
[<0, (4, 5, 9)>, <1, (2, 7, 8)>, <2, (1, 7, 9)>, <3, (5, 7, 9)>, <4, (0, 5, 9)>, <5, (0, 3, 9)>, <7, (1, 2, 3)>, <9, (0, 2, 5)>, <9, (8, 3, 5)>]

Therefore, the total count of 3-stars in this graph is [9].
