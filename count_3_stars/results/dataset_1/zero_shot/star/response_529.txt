Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 3-stars in this graph with the following unique configurations:

<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<0, (2, 5, 9)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<2, (0, 7, 9)>
<3, (0, 1, 4)>
<4, (0, 1, 3)>
<5, (0, 9, 9)>
<6, (8, 8, 8)>
<7, (1, 2, 3)>
<8, (6, 9, 9)>
<9, (0, 2, 3)> 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [11].
