Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].  

Unique 3-stars:
1. <0, (5, 9, 2)>
2. <9, (1, 4, 5)>
