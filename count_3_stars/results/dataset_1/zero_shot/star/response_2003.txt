Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:
[<0, (2, 3, 6)>, <1, (2, 4, 7)>, <2, (0, 1, 6)>, <4, (1, 6, 7)>, <6, (0, 2, 4)>]  

Therefore, there are a total of [5] 3-stars in the graph.
