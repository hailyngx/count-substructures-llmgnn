Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-star structures:
- <0, (5, 8, 1)>
- <1, (2, 5, 4)>
- <2, (1, 5, 8)>
- <4, (1, 8, 9)>
- <5, (0, 1, 2)>
- <8, (0, 2, 4)>
- <9, (2, 4, 8)>

Therefore, there are a total of [7] 3-stars in the graph.
