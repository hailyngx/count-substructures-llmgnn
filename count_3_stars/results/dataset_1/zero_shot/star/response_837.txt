Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.  
The unique 3-stars found are:  
<0, (2, 4, 6)>  
<0, (2, 4, 8)>  
<2, (0, 4, 3)>  
<9, (1, 3, 5)>
