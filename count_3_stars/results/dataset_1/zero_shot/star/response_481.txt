Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph has 6 nodes that can act as the center of a 3-star: 0, 1, 3, 6, 7, and 9. Let's analyze the possibilities:

1. For node 0:
    - (0, 4) (0, 6) (4, 0) (6, 0) forms a 3-star: <0, (4, 6, 8)>.
    Total: 1

2. For node 1:
    - No 3-star can be formed with node 1 as the center.
    Total: 0

3. For node 3:
    - (3, 8) (8, 3) forms a 3-star: <3, (8, 4, 5)>.
    Total: 1

4. For node 6:
    - (6, 0) (0, 6) forms a 3-star: <6, (0, 4, 8)>.
    Total: 1

5. For node 7:
    - (7, 5) (7, 9) (5, 7) (9, 7) forms two 3-stars: <7, (5, 1, 8)> and <7, (9, 5, 1)>.
    Total: 2

6. For node 9:
    - (7, 9) (9, 7) forms a 3-star: <9, (7, 5, 1)>.
    Total: 1

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5]. The unique 3-stars are <0, (4, 6, 8)>, <3, (8, 4, 5)>, <6, (0, 4, 8)>, <7, (5, 1, 8)>, and <9, (7, 5, 1)>.
