Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are <0, (3, 8, 9)>, <1, (2, 4, 9)>, and <2, (1, 3, 7)> 3-stars in this graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
