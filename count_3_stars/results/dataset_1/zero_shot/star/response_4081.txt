Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated by counting the number of nodes that can be the center of a 3-star graph. Since a 3-star consists of a center node and 3 leaves, any node connected to at least three other nodes can be the center of a 3-star.

From the given list of edges, we can identify the nodes that have at least three connections:

- Node 0 is connected to 3 nodes (3, 5, and 6).
- Node 4 is connected to 4 nodes (1, 7, 9, and 1).
- Node 5 is connected to 4 nodes (0, 6, 7, and 9).
- Node 6 is connected to 5 nodes (0, 3, 5, 7, and 8).
- Node 7 is connected to 4 nodes (4, 5, 6, and 9).

Hence, the nodes 0, 4, 5, 6, and 7 can each be the center of a 3-star. 

Calculating the number of unique 3-stars:
- Node 0: (3, 5, 6)
- Node 4: (1, 7, 9)
- Node 5: (0, 6, 7)
- Node 6: (0, 3, 5)
- Node 7: (4, 5, 9)

Therefore, there are [5] unique 3-stars in the given graph, which can be listed as follows:
<0, (3, 5, 6)>, <4, (1, 7, 9)>, <5, (0, 6, 7)>, <6, (0, 3, 5)>, <7, (4, 5, 9)>
