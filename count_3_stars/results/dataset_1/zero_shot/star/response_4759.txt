Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here is the list of unique 3-stars found:

<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<1, (2, 3, 8)>
<2, (1, 3, 8)>
<4, (0, 1, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
