Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (2, 5, 8)>
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<3, (2, 7, 8)>
<8, (0, 3, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
