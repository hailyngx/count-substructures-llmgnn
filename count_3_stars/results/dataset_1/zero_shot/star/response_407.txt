Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph consists of the following 3-star structures:

- <0, (4, 6, 7)>
- <1, (3, 5, 7)>
- <2, (7, 7, 7)>
- <3, (1, 5, 7)> 

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
