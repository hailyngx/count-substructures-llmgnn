Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
In this graph, there are [4] 3-stars.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 4, 7)>
<2, (7, 9, -)>
<3, (5, 8, -)>
<4, (0, 5, 9)>
