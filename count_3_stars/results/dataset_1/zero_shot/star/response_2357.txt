Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph contains the following 3-stars:
[<0, (1, 3, 4)>, <1, (0, 2, 7)>, <4, (0, 5, 8)>, <9, (1, 6, 8)>]
