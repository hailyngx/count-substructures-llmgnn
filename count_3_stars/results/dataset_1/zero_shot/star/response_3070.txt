Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 5, 9)>
<2, (0, 6, 7)>
<4, (7, 9, 0)>
<6, (0, 2, 7)>
