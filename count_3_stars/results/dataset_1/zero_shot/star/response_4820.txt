Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 3) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
The total number of 3-star structures can be determined by counting the number of occurrences where a node has exactly three edges connecting it to other nodes. Let's identify the 3-star structures in the given graph:

1. <0, (4, 9, 6)>
2. <1, (3, 6, 2)>
3. <2, (5, 6, 1)>
4. <3, (1, 6, 7)>
5. <4, (0, 6, 9)>
6. <5, (2, 6, -)>
7. <6, (1, 2, 3)>
8. <7, (3, -, -)>
9. <8, (3, -, -)>
10. <9, (0, 6, -)>

Therefore, there are a total of [10] 3-star structures in the given graph.
