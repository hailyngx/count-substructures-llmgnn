Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the graph can be calculated by counting the number of nodes that are connected to exactly 3 other nodes. Here is the list of unique 3-stars found in the graph:

[<0, (1, 2, 9)>, <2, (0, 1, 4)>, <3, (4, 8, 9)>, <4, (2, 3, 9)>, <8, (3, 6, 9)>, <9, (0, 4, 5)>]

Therefore, there are a total of [6] 3-stars in the graph.
