Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<4, (6, 7, 9)>
<5, (0, 1, 6)>
<6, (0, 2, 4)>
<7, (1, 4, 5)>
