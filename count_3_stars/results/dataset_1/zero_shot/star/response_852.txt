Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 3-star structures in the given graph are: <0, (4, 5, 7)>, <1, (2, 4, 8)>, and <9, (1, 4, 6)>.

So, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
