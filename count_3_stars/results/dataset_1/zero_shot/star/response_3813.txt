Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:

- <0, (1, 5, 9)>
- <1, (0, 4, 5)>
- <5, (0, 4, 9)>
- <9, (0, 5, 8)>

Thus, there are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the final answer is [4].
