Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are a total of [6] unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (4, 5, 1)> 
<3, (1, 6, 9)>
<6, (3, 7, 9)>
<1, (3, 4, 0)>
<2, (9, 9, 9)>
<9, (2, 7, 6)>
