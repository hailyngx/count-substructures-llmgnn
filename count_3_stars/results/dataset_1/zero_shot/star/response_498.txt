Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph.

The 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 5, 1)>
<1, (2, 4, 5)>
<2, (0, 1, 4)>
<3, (6, 7, 8)>
<4, (1, 2, 7)>
<5, (0, 1, 9)>
