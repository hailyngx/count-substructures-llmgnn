Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There is a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
  
List of unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 2, 7)>
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<3, (2, 9, 7)>
<6, (4, 8, 9)>
<8, (5, 6, 7)>
