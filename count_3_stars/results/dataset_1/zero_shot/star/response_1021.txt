Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph.  

The unique 3-stars are:
1. <0, (5, 6, 9)>
2. <2, (3, 4, 6)>
3. <3, (2, 5, 8)>
4. <4, (2, 5, 8)>
5. <5, (0, 3, 4)>
6. <6, (0, 4, 7)>
