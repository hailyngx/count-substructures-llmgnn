Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 2) (7, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's first list all the nodes connected to each node in the graph:
- Node 0: 1, 4
- Node 1: 0, 2
- Node 2: 1, 3, 5, 6, 9
- Node 3: 2
- Node 4: 0, 9
- Node 5: 2
- Node 6: 2
- Node 7: 9
- Node 9: 2, 4, 7

To find the 3-star patterns, we look for nodes that have exactly three neighbors. These nodes will serve as the centers of our 3-stars. 

The nodes that have exactly three neighbors are:
- Node 0 (neighbors: 1, 4)
- Node 1 (neighbors: 0, 2)
- Node 4 (neighbors: 0, 9)
- Node 5 (neighbors: 2)
- Node 6 (neighbors: 2) 

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
1. From Node 0: (0, 1, 4)
2. From Node 1: (1, 0, 2)
3. From Node 4: (4, 0, 9)
4. From Node 5: (5, 2)
5. From Node 6: (6, 2)

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5]. 
The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (1, 4)>
<1, (0, 2)>
<4, (0, 9)>
<5, (2)>
<6, (2)>
