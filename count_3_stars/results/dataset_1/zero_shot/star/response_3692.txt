Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The 3-stars in this graph are: <0, (2, 4, 5)>, <0, (2, 5, 7)>, <0, (2, 5, 9)>, <0, (4, 0, 7)>, <0, (4, 0, 9)>, <0, (5, 0, 7)>, <0, (5, 0, 9)>, <0, (7, 0, 5)>.

Counting all unique 3-stars, we get a total of [8].
