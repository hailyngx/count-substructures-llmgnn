Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (2, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of [4] 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (7, 9, 7)>
<6, (3, 5, 7)>
<7, (0, 6, 9)>
<9, (0, 3, 8)>
