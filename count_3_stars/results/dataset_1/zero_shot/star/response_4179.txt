Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the graph can be calculated by identifying the nodes with exactly three neighbors and considering each of them as the center of a 3-star.

After examining the given edges, we can see that only nodes 0, 1, 2, and 8 have exactly three neighbors. Let's list the unique 3-stars:

<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<1, (0, 2, 5)>
<2, (1, 4, 9)>
<8, (0, 2, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
