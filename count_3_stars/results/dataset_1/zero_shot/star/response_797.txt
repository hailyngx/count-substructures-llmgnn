Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<0, (4, 5, 8)>
<0, (4, 6, 9)>
<0, (5, 6, 7)>
