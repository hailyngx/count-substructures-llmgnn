Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are:
<0, (7, 8, 9)>
<1, (6, 7, 8)>
<2, (4, 5, 3)>
<3, (5, 2, 7)>
<4, (2, 5, 5)>
<5, (2, 4, 3)>
<6, (1, 7, 6)>
<7, (0, 3, 8)>
<8, (0, 7, 9)>
<9, (0, 7, 8)>

Therefore, there are [9] 3-star graphs in the given graph.
