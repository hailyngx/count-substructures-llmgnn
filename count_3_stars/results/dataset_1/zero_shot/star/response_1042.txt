Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are <0, (2, 3, 4)>, <1, (5, 7, 9)> and <3, (0, 4, 7)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
