Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph with 10 nodes and 26 edges is as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9  
Edges: (0, 2), (0, 9), (1, 8), (1, 9), (2, 0), (2, 5), (2, 9), (3, 5), (3, 9), (4, 7), (4, 9), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 7), (6, 9), (7, 4), (7, 5), (8, 1), (8, 9), (9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 6), (9, 8)

To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to find all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's list the unique 3-stars found:

<0, (2, 9, 1)>  
<1, (8, 9, 0)>  
<2, (0, 5, 9)>  
<3, (5, 9, 4)>  
<4, (7, 9, 3)>  
<5, (2, 3, 7)>  
<6, (9, 0, 2)>  
<7, (4, 5, 9)>  
<8, (1, 9, 0)>  
<9, (0, 1, 2)>

Thus, there are 9 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The final count is [9].
