Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 1) 

Response:
There are <0, (3, 5, 7)>, <1, (4, 9, -)>, <2, (3, 4, 6)>, and <5, (0, 4, 8)> as unique 3-stars in the given graph.
    Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
