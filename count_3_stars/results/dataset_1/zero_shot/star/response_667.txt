Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-star structures:

[<0, (6, 9)>, <2, (3, 4, 9)>, <3, (2, 7, 9)>, <6, (0, 4, 5)>, <7, (1, 3, 9)>, <9, (0, 2, 3, 7)>]

There are a total of 6 unique 3-stars in the graph, so the final answer is [6].
