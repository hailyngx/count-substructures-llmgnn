Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
    
    Unique 3-stars:
    <0, (3, 1, 5)>
    <1, (3, 4, 7)>
    <3, (0, 1, 5)>
    <3, (1, 5, 7)>
    <3, (4, 6, 8)>
    <3, (6, 7, 8)>
