Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
The central nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes are 0, 2, 5, and 9. Let's count the number of 3-stars for each central node:

- Central node 0: <0, (8, 9)>
- Central node 2: <2, (6, 7, 8)>
- Central node 5: <5, (4, 8)>
- Central node 9: <9, (0, 8)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
