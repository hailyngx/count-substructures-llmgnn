Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) 

Response:
There are two unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<1, (0, 3, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
