Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 6) (9, 4) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be calculated by first finding all nodes connected to exactly three other nodes and then counting the number of unique combinations of these nodes along with the center node. 

Let's find the 3-stars present in the given graph:
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 5 (a 3-star: <2, (1, 4, 5)>)
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 5 (a 3-star: <3, (1, 4, 5)>)
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 7 (a 3-star: <4, (2, 3, 7)>)
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 7 (a 3-star: <6, (2, 3, 7)>)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
