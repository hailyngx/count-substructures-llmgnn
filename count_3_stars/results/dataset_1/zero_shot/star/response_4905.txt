Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 8, 9)>
<1, (0, 5, 6)>
<2, (1, 5, 8)>
<5, (1, 6, 8)>
<6, (0, 5, 9)>
<9, (0, 3, 5)>
