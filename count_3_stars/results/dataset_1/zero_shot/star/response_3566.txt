Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 7, 9)>
<1, (0, 6, 8)>
<2, (5, 8, 5)>
<3, (4, 5, 9)>
