Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in this graph is [2].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<3, (2, 5, 7)>
