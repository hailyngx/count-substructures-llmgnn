Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

The 3-stars are:
<0, (6, 8, 1)>
<1, (2, 6, 7)>
<2, (1, 6, 8)>
<3, (4, 5, 8)>
<4, (3, 6, 9)>
<8, (0, 2, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
