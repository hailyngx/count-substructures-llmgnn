Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be calculated by counting the number of connected triples of nodes. To do this, we would look for nodes that are connected in a star-like pattern with one node as the center connected to three other nodes. 

In this case, the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (3, 4, 5)>
<2, (4, 5, 7)>
<4, (1, 2, 3)>
<4, (2, 6, 7)>
<4, (3, 6, 7)>
<4, (6, 8, 9)>
<6, (3, 4, 7)>
<8, (0, 2, 5)>

Counting these unique 3-stars gives us a total of [8].
