Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's analyze the given graph to identify the 3-stars it contains. 

Looking at the edges provided, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<1, (2, 3, 4)>
<3, (1, 5, 7)>
<5, (3, 7, 1)>
<6, (0, 7, 8)>
<8, (0, 6, 9)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph.
