Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 5 unique 3-star structures in this graph. 

The 3-star structures are:
1. <0, (3, 7, 8)>
2. <0, (3, 8, 9)>
3. <1, (2, 3, 8)>
4. <2, (1, 3, 4)>
5. <3, (0, 1, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
