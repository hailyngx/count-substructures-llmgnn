Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph: <0, (3, 4, 7)>, <3, (0, 1, 5)>, <4, (0, 5, 8)>, <5, (2, 3, 4)>, <7, (0, 8, 9)>.
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
