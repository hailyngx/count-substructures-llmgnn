Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 5 unique 3-stars in this graph. Here are the 3-stars found:

    <0, (4, 6, 2)>
    <1, (3, 5, 7)>
    <4, (0, 3, 5)>
    <5, (1, 4, 8)>
    <6, (0, 2, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
