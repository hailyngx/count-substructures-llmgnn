Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 4) (9, 2) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-star subgraphs:

\[<0, (1, 4, 5)>, <1, (0, 4, 7)>, <2, (6, 9, -)>, <3, (0, 1, 6)>, <4, (0, 1, 7)> \]

There are 5 unique 3-stars in this graph, thus the final answer is [5].
