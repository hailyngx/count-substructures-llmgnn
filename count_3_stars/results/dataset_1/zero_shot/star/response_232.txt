Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
The 3-stars are: <0, (2, 3, 4)> and <0, (5, 6, 7)>.
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
