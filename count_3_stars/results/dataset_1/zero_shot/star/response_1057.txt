Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph.  

The unique 3-stars are:  
<0, (1, 4, 8)>  
<1, (0, 3, 6)>  
<2, (4, 5, 9)>  
<4, (0, 2, 5)>  
<5, (2, 3, 6)>  
<9, (0, 6, 8)>
