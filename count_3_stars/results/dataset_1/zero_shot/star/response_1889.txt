Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph contains the following 3-stars:

[<0, (1, 4, 5)>, <3, (0, 5, 6)>, <6, (3, 7, 9)>, <9, (6, 8, 9)>] 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
