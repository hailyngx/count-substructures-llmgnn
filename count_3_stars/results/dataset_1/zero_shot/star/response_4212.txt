Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 5) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph can be counted by identifying the central node and the three leaves connected to it. Since each 3-star contributes one to the count, we simply need to find all unique combinations of central nodes and connected leaves.

Based on the given graph, the 3-stars can be listed as follows:
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<2, (0, 5, 7)>
<2, (0, 5, 8)>
<2, (5, 7, 8)>
<3, (6, 8, -)>
<4, (0, 1, 5)>
<5, (0, 1, 2)>
<8, (2, 3, 7)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we find that there are [8] 3-stars in total.
