Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The 3-stars are as follows:  
<0, (6, 7, 9)>  
<1, (2, 3, 5)>  
<3, (1, 2, 7)>  
<6, (0, 4, 5)>  

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
