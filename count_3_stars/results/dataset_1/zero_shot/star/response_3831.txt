Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<2, (7, 8, 9)>
<3, (4, 9, 5)>
<4, (3, 5, 8)>
<5, (4, 6, 8)>
<7, (0, 1, 2)>
<9, (2, 3, 5)>
