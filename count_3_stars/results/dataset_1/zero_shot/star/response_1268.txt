Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph.  

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<1, (0, 6, 8)>
<2, (4, 5, 7)>
<3, (8)>
<4, (0, 2, 5)>
<5, (2, 4, 8)>
