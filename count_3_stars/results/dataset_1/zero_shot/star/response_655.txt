Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
The graph contains three 3-stars. The unique 3-stars are as follows:
<0, (2, 7, 9)>
<2, (0, 4, 6)>
<4, (2, 6, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
