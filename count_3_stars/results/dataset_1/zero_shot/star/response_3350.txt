Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph.    

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<1, (0, 4, 8)>
<1, (2, 4, 9)>
<4, (1, 2, 5)>
<8, (1, 5, 9)>
