Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<6, (1, 3, 7)>
