This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are [2] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<3, (0, 5, 6)>
