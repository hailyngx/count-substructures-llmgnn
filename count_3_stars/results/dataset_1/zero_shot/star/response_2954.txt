Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<1, (0, 2, 6)>
