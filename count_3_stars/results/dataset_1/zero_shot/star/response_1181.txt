Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 6) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph contains the following 3-stars:
[<0, (1, 9, 6)>, <1, (0, 2, 8)>, <2, (1, 6, 7)>]
There are a total of 3 unique 3-stars in the graph.
