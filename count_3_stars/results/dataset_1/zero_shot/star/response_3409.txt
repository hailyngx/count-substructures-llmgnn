Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 8, 9)>
<3, (1, 2, 4)>
<3, (1, 4, 5)>
<3, (1, 5, 9)>
