Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [5] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (5, 8, 9)>
<2, (3, 4, 8)>
<3, (1, 2, 6)>
<6, (3, 7, 8)>
<8, (0, 2, 9)>
