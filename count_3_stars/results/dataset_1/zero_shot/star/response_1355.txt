Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.
    
    Unique 3-stars found: 
    <0, (1, 6, 7)>
    <0, (1, 7, 8)>
    <0, (1, 7, 9)>
    <4, (2, 3, 5)>
