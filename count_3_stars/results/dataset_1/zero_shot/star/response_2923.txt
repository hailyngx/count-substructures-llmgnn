Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph:
<0, (2, 3, 8)>
<1, (5, 7, 8)>
<2, (0, 3, 8)>
<3, (2, 5, 8)>
<5, (1, 3, 8)>
<7, (1, 5, 8)>
