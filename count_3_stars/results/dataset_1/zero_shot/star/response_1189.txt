Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:
[<0, (2, 8, 1)>, <0, (8, 2, 4)>, <2, (0, 3, 4)>, <3, (2, 9, 6)>]

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
