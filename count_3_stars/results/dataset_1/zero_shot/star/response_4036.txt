Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph: 
<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<0, (5, 6, 9)>
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<2, (0, 1, 5)>
<4, (0, 5, 6)>
<6, (0, 3, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
