Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [2] 3-stars in the given graph.  

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<1, (0, 2, 4)>
