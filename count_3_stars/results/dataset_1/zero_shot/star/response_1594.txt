Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:
[<0, (2, 3, 5)>, <5, (0, 2, 9)>] 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
