Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [14] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 2, 8)>
<1, (0, 5, 2)>
<2, (0, 4, 5)>
<2, (4, 6, 3)>
<3, (4, 6, 7)>
<4, (2, 3, 7)>
<4, (7, 9, 2)>
<5, (2, 1, 0)>
<6, (2, 3, 4)>
<7, (3, 4, 9)>
<7, (4, 3, 9)>
<8, (0, 2, 1)>
<9, (4, 7, 3)>
<9, (7, 4, 3)>
