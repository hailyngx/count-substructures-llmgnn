Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 11 3-stars in this graph. Here is the representation of each unique 3-star found:

[<0, (3, 4, 6)>]
[<0, (3, 6, 9)>]
[<0, (4, 6, 9)>]
[<1, (3, 5, 7)>]
[<2, (8, 9, 5)>]
[<3, (0, 1, 5)>]
[<4, (0, 5, 7)>]
[<5, (3, 4, 8)>]
[<5, (3, 8, 9)>]
[<7, (1, 4, 7)>]
[<9, (0, 2, 8)>]
