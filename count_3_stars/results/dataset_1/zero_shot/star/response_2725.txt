Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph:
<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<2, (5, 6, 7)>
<3, (6, 8, 9)>
<4, (7, 8, 4)>
<5, (1, 2, 6)>
<7, (2, 4, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
