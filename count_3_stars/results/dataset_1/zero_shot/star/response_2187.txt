Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [2] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (7, 9, -)>
<9, (0, 2, 3)>
