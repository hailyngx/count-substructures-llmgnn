Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph can be found by identifying the central nodes with exactly 3 neighbors. Let's find these unique 3-stars:

1. <0, (5, 6, 7)>
2. <1, (2, 3, 5)>
3. <2, (1, 4, 7)>
4. <4, (2, 3, 5)>
5. <5, (0, 1, 7)>
6. <7, (1, 2, 5)>
7. <9, (2, 7, 9)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars: [7]
