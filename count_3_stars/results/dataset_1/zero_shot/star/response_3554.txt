Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are [8] 3-stars in the given graph. 
Here are the unique 3-stars:
<0, (2, 8, 6)>
<1, (3, 4, 6)>
<2, (0, 3, 4)>
<3, (1, 2, 6)>
<4, (1, 2, 5)>
<5, (4, 6, 9)>
<6, (1, 3, 5)>
<9, (4, 5, 9)>
