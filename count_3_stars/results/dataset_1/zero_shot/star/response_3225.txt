Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The graph contains a total of 6 unique 3-stars. Here is the list of the unique 3-stars found:
  
  <0, (4, 7, 1)>
  <1, (4, 6, 7)>
  <4, (0, 1, 6)>
  <6, (1, 4, 9)>
  <7, (0, 1, 9)>
  <9, (4, 5, 6)>
  
  Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
