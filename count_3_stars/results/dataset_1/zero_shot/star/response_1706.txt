Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the final answer is [5].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<2, (3, 7, 9)>
<3, (2, 7, 9)>
<4, (1, 5, 6)>
<5, (0, 1, 4)>
<6, (4, 5, 7)>
