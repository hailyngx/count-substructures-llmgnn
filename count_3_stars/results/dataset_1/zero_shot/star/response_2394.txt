Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are 7 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The final answer is [7].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<0, (1, 6, 9)>
<0, (2, 3, 9)>
<1, (0, 6, 7)>
<2, (0, 3, 9)>
<3, (0, 2, 9)>
<6, (0, 1, 4)>
