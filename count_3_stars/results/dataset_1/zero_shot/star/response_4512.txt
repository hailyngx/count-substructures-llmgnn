Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 2, 6)>
<1, (0, 2, 4)>
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<3, (0, 2, 9)>
<4, (1, 5, 8)>
<6, (0, 2, 7)>
