Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 10 nodes and 30 edges provided. Let's find the number of 3-stars in this graph.

Observations:
- For a 3-star, we need a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.
- A 3-star can be uniquely represented as (center, leaf1, leaf2, leaf3).

Now, let's analyze the given graph to identify the 3-stars:

1. Central node 0:
    - (0, 2, 7, 9)
    <0, (2, 7, 9)>

2. Central node 2:
    - (2, 0, 3, 8)
    <2, (0, 3, 8)>

3. Central node 3:
    - (3, 2, 5, 7)
    <3, (2, 5, 7)>
    - (3, 4, 6, 8)
    <3, (4, 6, 8)>

4. Central node 4: (There are no 3-stars with node 4 as the central node.)

5. Central node 5: (There are no 3-stars with node 5 as the central node.)

6. Central node 6: (There are no 3-stars with node 6 as the central node.)

7. Central node 7:
    - (7, 0, 2, 5)
    <7, (0, 2, 5)>
    - (7, 3, 6, 9)
    <7, (3, 6, 9)>

8. Central node 8: (There are no 3-stars with node 8 as the central node.)

9. Central node 9: (There are no 3-stars with node 9 as the central node.)

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (2, 7, 9)>, <2, (0, 3, 8)>, <3, (2, 5, 7)>, <3, (4, 6, 8)>, <7, (0, 2, 5)>, <7, (3, 6, 9)>
  
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
