Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be counted based on the central node of the star. Since each 3-star has exactly one central node and three leaf nodes, we'll look for nodes connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern.

Based on the provided edges, the 3-stars in this graph are as follows:
<1, (3, 6, 8)>
<2, (7, 8, 8)>
<3, (0, 1, 9)>
<7, (2, 4, 8)>
<8, (0, 1, 2)>

Counting these unique 3-stars, we have a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
