Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The center node and leaf nodes for each 3-star are as follows:
<0, (2, 3, 6)>
<5, (1, 4, 9)>
<8, (2, 3, 4)>
<7, (6, 9, 0)>

There are a total of [4] 3-stars in the given graph.
