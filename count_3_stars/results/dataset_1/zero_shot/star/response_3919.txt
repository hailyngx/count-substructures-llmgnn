Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph contains the following 3-stars:
    <0, (3, 4, 8)>
    <1, (2, 6, 7)>
    <2, (1, 3, 5)>
    <3, (0, 2, 9)>
    <4, (0, 3, 6)>
    <5, (2, 4, 7)>
    <6, (1, 4, 9)>
    <7, (1, 5, 9)>
    <8, (1, 3, 4)>
    <9, (3, 6, 7)>
    
    Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
