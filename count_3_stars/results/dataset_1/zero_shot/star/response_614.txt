Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The given graph has 5 3-star subgraphs. Here they are represented within <>:

<1, (5, 6, 7)>
<2, (5, 1, 6)>
<3, (5, 8, 1)>
<4, (7, 1, 9)>
<5, (1, 2, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
