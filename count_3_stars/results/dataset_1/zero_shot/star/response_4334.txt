Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. These 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<1, (0, 4, 8)>
<2, (3, 8, 9)>
<4, (0, 1, 6)>
<6, (1, 4, 9)>
<9, (2, 4, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
