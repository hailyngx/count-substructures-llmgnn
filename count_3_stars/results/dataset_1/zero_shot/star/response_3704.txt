Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
There are a total of [10] nodes and [20] edges in the given graph. To count the number of 3-stars, we need to identify all instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

After analyzing the edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<1, (4, 6, 8)>
<1, (4, 6, 9)>
<1, (6, 8, 9)>
<2, (1, 9, 4)>
<4, (1, 5, 7)>
<4, (5, 1, 7)>
<6, (1, 7, 7)>
<7, (0, 4, 6)>
<9, (1, 2, 1)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
