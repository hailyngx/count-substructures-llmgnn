Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.  

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (2, 4, 5)>
<4, (1, 5, 7)>
<5, (1, 4, 6)>
<6, (1, 3, 5)>
