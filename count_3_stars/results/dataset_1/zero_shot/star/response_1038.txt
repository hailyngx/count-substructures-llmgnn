Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph. 
The unique 3-stars are: 
<1, (5, 6, 9)>
<4, (5, 6, 8)>
<5, (1, 4, 8)>
<6, (1, 4, 7)>
