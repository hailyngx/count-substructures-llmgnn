Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph, which are:
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<3, (0, 6, 9)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
