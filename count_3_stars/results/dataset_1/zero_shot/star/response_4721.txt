Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 9) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 9, 7)>
<2, (7, 9, 1)>
<5, (6, 8, -)>
<6, (5, 8, -)>
