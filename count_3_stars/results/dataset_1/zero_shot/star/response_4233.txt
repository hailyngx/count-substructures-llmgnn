Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 3-star structures in the given graph. Let's list them and then count them:

<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<3, (0, 4, 5)>
<4, (0, 3, 5)>
<5, (0, 3, 4)>
<7, (0, 1, 2)>
<9, (1, 5, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
