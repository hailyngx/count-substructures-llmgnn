Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [10] unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (8, 9, 1)>
<1, (4, 8, 9)>
<2, (1, 9, 0)>
<3, (5, 6, 9)>
<4, (1, 5, 8)>
<5, (4, 7, 9)>
<6, (8, 9, 3)>
<7, (5, 9, 8)>
<8, (0, 1, 6)>
<9, (0, 1, 8)>
