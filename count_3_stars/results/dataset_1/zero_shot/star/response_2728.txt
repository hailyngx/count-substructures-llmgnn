Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 7 unique 3-stars in the given graph:  

<0, (1, 2, 3)>  
<0, (1, 4, 8)>  
<0, (2, 4, 8)>  
<1, (0, 4, 9)>  
<2, (0, 4, 9)>  
<3, (0, 7, )>  
<4, (1, 2, 8)>  

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
