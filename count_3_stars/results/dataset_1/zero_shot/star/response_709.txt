Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (6, 1) (7, 4) 

Response:
There are four 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
1. <1, (0, 5, 6)>
2. <2, (1, 4, 5)>
3. <4, (2, 3, 7)>
4. <5, (1, 2, 6)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
