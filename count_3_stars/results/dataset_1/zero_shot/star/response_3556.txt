Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 3 unique 3-stars in the given graph, as follows:
<2, (0, 6, 7)>
<3, (1, 6, 7)>
<6, (3, 7, 2)>
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
