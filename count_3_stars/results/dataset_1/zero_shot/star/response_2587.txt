Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. Let's identify the 3-stars present in the graph:

1. <0, (1, 3, 7)>
2. <1, (0, 4, 6)>
3. <3, (0, 4, 5)>
4. <6, (1, 2, 5)>
5. <7, (0, 3, 8)>
6. <9, (5, 6, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
