Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The 3-stars are as follows:
<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<0, (8, 1, 4)>
<1, (6, 5, 7)>
<1, (7, 8, 9)>
<2, (0, 3, 4)>
<7, (1, 3, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
