Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 3-star configurations in the given graph. The total number of 3-stars is [12].
    <1, (4, 6, 7)>
    <2, (1, 3, 8)>
    <2, (3, 5, 6)>
    <4, (0, 1, 7)>
    <4, (1, 6, 5)>
    <5, (1, 3, 9)>
    <5, (3, 6, 8)>
    <6, (2, 4, 5)>
    <8, (2, 5, 9)>
    <9, (5, 8, 9)>
