Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-star structures:

[<0, (4, 5, 8)>, <2, (1, 4, 6)>, <3, (1, 6, 7)>, <6, (2, 3, 7)>]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
