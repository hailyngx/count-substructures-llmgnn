Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph contains the following 3-stars:
[<0, (2, 4, 9)>, <1, (3, 6, 7)>, <2, (3, 5, 8)>]
There are a total of 3 3-stars in the graph. Therefore, the answer is [3].
