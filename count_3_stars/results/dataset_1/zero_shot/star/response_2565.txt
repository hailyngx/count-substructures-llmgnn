Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 3-stars in this graph.

The 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (5, 7, 2)>
<3, (4, 8, 9)>
<6, (7, 8, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
