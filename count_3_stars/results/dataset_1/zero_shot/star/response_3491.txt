Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 8, 9)>
<2, (0, 5, 6)>
<3, (5, 7, -)>
<4, (5, 9, -)>
<5, (2, 3, 4)>
<6, (2, 9, -)>
<7, (3, -, -)>
<8, (0, 5, -)>
<9, (2, 4, 6)>
