Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 1) (9, 1) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:  
- <1, (7, 8, 9)>
- <7, (0, 1, 5)>

Therefore, there are a total of [2] unique 3-stars in the graph.
