Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [8] 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<2, (0, 8, 9)>
<8, (2, 6, 9)>
<9, (2, 8, 8)>
<0, (2, 8, 2)>
<6, (1, 8, 8)>
<1, (6, 6, 8)>
<5, (3, 7, 7)>
<7, (5, 8, 8)>
