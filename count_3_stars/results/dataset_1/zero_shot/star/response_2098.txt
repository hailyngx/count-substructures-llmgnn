Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph can be represented as follows:
{0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

To count the number of 3-stars, we need to find the central node and its connected leaves. 

Observing the given edges, we can identify the 3-stars in this graph:

<0, (2, 4)>  
<3, (2, 7, 8)>  
<4, (0, 5, 8)>  
<7, (3, 6, 8)>  
<8, (3, 4, 6, 7)>  
<9, (3, 4)>

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
