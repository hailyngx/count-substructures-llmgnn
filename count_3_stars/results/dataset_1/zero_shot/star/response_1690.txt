Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of 4 unique 3-stars in this graph:

- <0, (1, 2, 6)>
- <1, (0, 4, 5)> 
- <4, (1, 3, 6)>
- <5, (1, 4, 9)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
