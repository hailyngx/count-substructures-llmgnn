Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (6, 0) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 6, 7)>
<8, (2, 6, 7)>
