Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are:
    - <1, (0, 3, 4)>
    - <4, (1, 2, 6)>
    - <7, (1, 2, 8)>
    - <9, (3, 4, 6)>
    [4]
