Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are:
    <0, (6, 8, 1)>
    <1, (6, 7, 0)>
    <2, (3, 7, 9)>
    <3, (2, 4, 5)>
    <4, (3, 6, 5)>
    <5, (4, 3, 5)>
    <6, (0, 4, 7)>
    <7, (1, 2, 4)>
    <8, (0, 7, 6)>
    <9, (2, 7, 9)>
