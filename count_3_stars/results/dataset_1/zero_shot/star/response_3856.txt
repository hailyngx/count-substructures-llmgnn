Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 4) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (0, 8), (1, 6), (1, 7), (2, 6), (2, 7), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 8), (5, 4), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (7, 1), (7, 2), (8, 0), (8, 4)

There are two 3-stars in this graph. Let's list them:
<1, (6, 7, 2)>
<4, (5, 8, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
