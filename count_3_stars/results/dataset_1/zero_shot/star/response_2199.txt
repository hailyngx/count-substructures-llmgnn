Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are <0, (5, 6, 7)>, <1, (3, 4, 8)>, <2, (3, 4, 5)>, <2, (5, 7, 9)>, <3, (1, 2, 8)>, <3, (4, 5, 8)>, <4, (1, 2, 7)>, <4, (2, 3, 7)>, <5, (0, 2, 3)>, <5, (2, 3, 7)>, <5, (3, 7, 9)>, <6, (0, 7, 9)>, <7, (2, 4, 5)>, <7, (4, 5, 6)>, <8, (1, 3, 5)>, <9, (2, 5, 6)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [16].
