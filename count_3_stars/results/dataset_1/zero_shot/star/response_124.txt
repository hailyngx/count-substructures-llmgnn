Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 46 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph, which are:
<0, (4, 6, 9)>
<1, (2, 9, 0)>
<2, (1, 3, 4)>
<2, (3, 5, 7)>
<2, (4, 9, 5)>
<3, (2, 4, 5)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
