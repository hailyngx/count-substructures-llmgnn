Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].

The two unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (4, 8, 9)>
<1, (2, 7, 9)>
