Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:
1. <0, (1, 2, 7)>
2. <1, (0, 2, 6)>
3. <2, (0, 1, 6)>
4. <6, (1, 2, 9)>
5. <8, (1, 4, 6)>

Therefore, there are [5] 3-stars in the graph.
