Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The 3-stars are as follows:
   
<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<1, (3, 5, 7)>
<2, (0, 6, 7)>
<3, (0, 1, 5)>
<4, (0, 6, 7)>
<7, (0, 1, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
