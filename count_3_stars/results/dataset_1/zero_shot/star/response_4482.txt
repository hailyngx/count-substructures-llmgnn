Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:
[<0, (7, 8, 9)>, <1, (2, 3, 8)>, <2, (1, 4, 8)>, <3, (1, 7, 9)>, <8, (0, 1, 2)>, <9, (0, 2, 3)>]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
