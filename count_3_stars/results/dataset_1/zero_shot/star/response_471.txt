Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (5, 7, 1)>
<5, (0, 1, 3)>
<3, (5, 6, 8)>
