Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are 8 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The unique 3-stars are as follows:
    
    <0, (1, 4, 8)>
    <1, (0, 2, 8)>
    <2, (1, 5, None)>
    <3, (4, 5, 9)>
    <4, (0, 3, 6)>
    <5, (2, 3, 6)>
    <6, (4, 5, None)>
    <7, (5, 8, None)>
    
    Therefore, there are a total of [8] 3-stars.
