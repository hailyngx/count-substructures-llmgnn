Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
