Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of 3-star configurations can be calculated by first determining all the nodes that have exactly 3 edges connected to them. These nodes can potentially be at the center of 3-star graphs, with the other ends of these edges forming the leaves.

In this graph, the nodes with exactly 3 edges connected to them are nodes 0, 2, 7, and 6. Let's identify the 3-stars formed by these central nodes along with their leaves:

- <0, (1, 8, 9)>
- <2, (4, 5, 7)>
- <7, (2, 4, 8)>
- <6, (3, 5, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [4].
