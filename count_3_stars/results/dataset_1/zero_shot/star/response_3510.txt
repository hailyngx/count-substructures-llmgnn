Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 6 3-stars in the given graph. The unique 3-stars found inside <> are as follows: <0, (2, 4, 7)>, <1, (2, 5, 6)>, <2, (0, 1, 8)>, <3, (6, 7, 8)>, <4, (0, 6, 8)>, <5, (1, 6, 9)>.  
Therefore, the final answer is [6].
