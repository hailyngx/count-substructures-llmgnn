Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:
[<0, (1, 7, 8)>, <1, (0, 7, 9)>, <2, (3, 5, 8)>, <3, (2, 4, 7)>, <4, (1, 3, 7)>, <5, (2, 6, 7)>, <6, (5, 7, 0)>, <8, (0, 2, 9)>, <9, (1, 5, 8)>]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
