Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:
<0, (3, 6, 9)>
<1, (6, 7, 8)>
<2, (5, 6, _)> [Note that there's only one edge connected to node 2, so the last node in the 3-star cannot be determined.]
<3, (0, 7, 9)>
<4, (6, 7, 9)>
<5, (2, 6, _)> [Similar to node 2, the last node cannot be determined.]
<6, (0, 1, 4)>
<7, (1, 3, 4)>
<8, (1, 7, _)> [Only one adjacent node, so the third node in the 3-star is unknown.]
<9, (0, 3, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
