Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 3 3-stars in the given graph. The unique 3-stars found are:

<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<3, (0, 2, 5)>
<5, (0, 3, 7)>

Therefore, the final answer is [3].
