Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of 3-star structures in the given graph can be calculated by identifying the nodes that have exactly three neighbors. Let's first list the nodes with three neighbors.

Nodes with 3 neighbors:
- Node 0 (neighbors: 1, 4, 8)
- Node 2 (neighbors: 3, 4, 5)
- Node 3 (neighbors: 2, 4, 7)
- Node 4 (neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 7)
- Node 5 (neighbors: 2, 6, 8)
- Node 7 (neighbors: 3, 4, 6, 8, 9)
- Node 9 (neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8)

Now, we can observe the 3-star structures in the graph:
<0, (1, 4, 8)>
<2, (3, 4, 5)>
<3, (2, 4, 7)>
<5, (2, 6, 8)>
<7, (3, 4, 6)>
<9, (1, 3, 8)>

Counting the total number of unique 3-stars found in the graph, we have found 6 different 3-stars. Thus, the final answer is [6].
