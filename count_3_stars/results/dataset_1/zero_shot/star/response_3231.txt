Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 0) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.  

<0, (1, 3, 5)>  
<1, (0, 7, 8)>  
<5, (0, 4, 8)>  
<7, (1, 6, 9)>
