Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 6 total 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (7, 8, 9)>
<1, (4, 5, 9)>
<3, (5, 6, 8)>
<3, (5, 8, 9)>
<4, (1, 5, 9)>
<4, (5, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the final answer is: [6].
