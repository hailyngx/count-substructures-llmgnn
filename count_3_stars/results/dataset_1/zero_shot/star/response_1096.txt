Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
The graph contains 4 unique 3-stars: 

<0, (6, 7, 9)>
<1, (2, 3, _)>
<2, (1, 5, 9)>
<3, (1, 8, _)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
