Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are six unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

The 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 6, 8)>
<1, (0, 6, 8)>
<7, (4, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 1, 3)>
<9, (0, 7, 1)>
<3, (1, 8, 1)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
