Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 6, 8)>
<1, (6, 8, 9)>
<3, (0, 6, 9)>
<4, (7, 9, 6)>
<6, (1, 2, 8)>
<9, (1, 4, 6)>
