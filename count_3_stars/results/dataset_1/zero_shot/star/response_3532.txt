Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph can be calculated by considering each node as the center of the star and checking its connections. 

Let's go through each node to identify the 3-stars:

1. Node 0: <0, (1, 3, 5)>, <0, (1, 5, 9)>
2. Node 1: <1, (0, 5, 6)>, <1, (0, 5, 9)>, <1, (5, 6, 7)>
3. Node 2: No 3-stars as it has only one edge.
4. Node 3: <3, (0, 8, 9)>
5. Node 4: <4, (2, 8, 8)>
6. Node 5: <5, (0, 1, 6)>, <5, (0, 1, 9)>
7. Node 6: No 3-stars as it has only two edges.
8. Node 7: No 3-stars as it has only three edges.
9. Node 8: <8, (3, 4, 7)>
10. Node 9: No 3-stars as it has only two edges.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
