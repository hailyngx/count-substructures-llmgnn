Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:
[<1, (0, 2, 5)>, <1, (2, 5, 6)>, <1, (5, 4, 9)>]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
