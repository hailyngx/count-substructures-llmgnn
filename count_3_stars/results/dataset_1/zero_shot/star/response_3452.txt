Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of 5 unique 3-stars in this graph. Here they are:

<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<2, (0, 5, 9)>
<3, (0, 1, 4)>
<4, (1, 3, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
