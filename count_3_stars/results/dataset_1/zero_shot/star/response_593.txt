Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (3, 5) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 0) 

Response:
The given graph has the following connections:
- Node 0 is adjacent to nodes 5, 8, and 9.
- Node 1 is adjacent to node 5.
- Node 3 is adjacent to node 5.
- Node 4 is adjacent to node 5.
- Node 5 is adjacent to nodes 0, 1, 3, 4.
- Node 6 is adjacent to node 7.
- Node 7 is adjacent to nodes 6, 8.
- Node 8 is adjacent to nodes 0, 7.
- Node 9 is adjacent to node 0.

Let's find the 3-stars in this graph.

We have 2 possible 3-stars since the possible central nodes are node 0 and node 5.

For central node 0:
- <0, (5, 8, 9)>

For central node 5:
- <5, (0, 1, 3)>
- <5, (0, 1, 4)>
- <5, (0, 3, 4)>

Therefore, we have a total of [4] 3-stars in this graph: <0, (5, 8, 9)>, <5, (0, 1, 3)>, <5, (0, 1, 4)>, <5, (0, 3, 4)>.
