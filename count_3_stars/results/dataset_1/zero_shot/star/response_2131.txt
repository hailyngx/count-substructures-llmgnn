Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [20]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (4, 7, 8)>
<1, (5, 6, 9)>
<2, (7, 8, 9)>
<4, (0, 7, 8)>
<5, (1, 3, 9)>
<6, (1, 9, 5)>
<7, (0, 2, 4)>
<8, (2, 4, 9)>
<9, (5, 6, 7)>
<(3, 5, 9)>
