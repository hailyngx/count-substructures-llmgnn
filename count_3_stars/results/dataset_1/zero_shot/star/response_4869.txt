Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
  
The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 7, 8)>
<1, (4, 6, 9)>
<3, (0, 8, 9)>
<5, (2, 4, 9)>
