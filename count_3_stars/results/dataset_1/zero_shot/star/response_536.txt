Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 2) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph. 
The unique 3-stars are <0, (2, 5, 6)>, <1, (2, 4, 5)>, <2, (1, 4, 6)>, and <4, (1, 2, 5)>.
