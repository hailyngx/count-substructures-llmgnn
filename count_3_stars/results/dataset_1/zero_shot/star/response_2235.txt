Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [2] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 3, 6)>
<1, (8, 9, 0)>
