Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph can be identified by looking for nodes with exactly three incident edges. 

Upon examining the graph, we can find the following 3-star graphs: 
<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<1, (0, 3, 7)>
<2, (4, 5, 8)>
<9, (0, 2, 4)>

Since each 3-star graph is unique, the final count is [4].
