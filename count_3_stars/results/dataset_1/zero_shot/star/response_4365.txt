Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.  

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (4, 7, 9)>  
<5, (3, 6, 8)>  
<6, (1, 2, 3)>  
<7, (0, 2, 4)>
