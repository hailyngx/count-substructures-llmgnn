Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are:
[<0, (1, 6, 3)>, <1, (0, 5, 7)>, <2, (3, 7, 8)>, <3, (2, 6, 7)>, <4, (9, 7, 0)>, <5, (1, 1, 0)>, <6, (0, 3, 0)>, <7, (2, 3, 8)>, <8, (3, 7, 7)>, <9, (4, 7, 7)>]
