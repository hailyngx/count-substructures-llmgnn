Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [8] 3-stars in the given graph.

<1, (7, 8, 0)>
<2, (5, 6, 0)>
<3, (4, 5, 7)>
<4, (3, 5, 8)>
<5, (0, 7, 2)>
<6, (2, 5, 0)>
<8, (1, 4, 7)>
