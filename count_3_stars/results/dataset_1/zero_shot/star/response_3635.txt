Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are [2] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are <0, (5, 6, 9)> and <4, (5, 6, 8)>.
