Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 3-star structures in this graph. Here is the list of unique 3-stars found:

<0, (2, 6, -)>  
<1, (2, 5, 7)>  
<2, (0, 1, 3)>  
<3, (2, 4, -)>  
<4, (3, 7, -)>  
<5, (1, 2, 7)>  
<6, (0, -, -)>  
<7, (1, 4, 5)>  
<8, (9, -, -)>   
<9, (2, 5, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [9].
