Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are as follows:
<0, (2, 5, 1)>
<1, (2, 3, 6)>
<2, (0, 1, 6)>
<2, (6, 7, 8)>
<2, (8, 9, 1)>
<3, (1, 5, 0)>
<4, (5, 6, 8)>
<6, (1, 2, 4)>
<6, (2, 4, 9)>
<8, (2, 4, 9)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
