Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) 

Response:
There are a total of 3-stars in this graph.  

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (5, 7, 6)>
<3, (2, 8, 8)>
<5, (1, 7, 6)>

Therefore, the final answer is [3].
