Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
There is a total of [4] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<2, (6, 8, 9)>
<3, (0, 1, 5)>
<6, (0, 2, 4)>
