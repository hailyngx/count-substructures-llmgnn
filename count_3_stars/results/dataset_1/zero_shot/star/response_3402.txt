Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 4) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:
```
0 --- 2
|     |
|     |
5 --- 1 --- 4 --- 9
      |     |     |
      |     |     |
      8 --- 7 --- 3
```

To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we will identify the 3-stars one by one. 
Here are the unique 3-stars in the graph:
1. <0, (2, 5, 1)>
2. <1, (2, 4, 7)>
3. <2, (0, 5, 7)>
4. <4, (1, 5, 7)>
5. <5, (0, 2, 1)>
6. <7, (1, 4, 5)>
7. <8, (1, 3, 5)>
8. <9, (4, 1, 7)>

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
