Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 7, 9)>
<1, (0, 2, 4)>
<4, (1, 5, 9)>
<9, (3, 6, 7)>
