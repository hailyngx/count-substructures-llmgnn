Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars present in the given graph. The count is in brackets [].

<0, (4, 6, 8)>
<1, (2, 3, 5)>
<2, (1, 4, 5)>
<3, (1, 4, 5)>
<4, (0, 2, 3)>
<5, (1, 3, 4)>
