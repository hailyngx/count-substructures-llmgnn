Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 6 3-stars in the graph. Here is a list of the unique 3-stars:

<0, (1, 3, 7)>
<1, (0, 2, 4)>
<2, (1, 4, 5)>
<3, (0, 4, 9)>
<4, (1, 2, 6)>
<6, (2, 4, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
