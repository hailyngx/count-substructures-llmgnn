Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are <0, (1, 5, 7)>, <2, (3, 6, 9)>, <4, (6, - , -)> 3-stars in the given graph.
    Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
