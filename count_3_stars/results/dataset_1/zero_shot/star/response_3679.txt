Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 1) (9, 0) 

Response:
There are a total of [7] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 5, 7)>
<0, (7, 1, 9)>
<1, (3, 4, 8)>
<2, (0, 4, 5)>
<3, (0, 1, 5)>
<4, (1, 2, 3)>
<5, (0, 3, 7)>
