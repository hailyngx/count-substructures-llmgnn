Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of [3] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (7, 8, 0)>
<2, (3, 4, 9)>
<5, (1, 7, 9)>
