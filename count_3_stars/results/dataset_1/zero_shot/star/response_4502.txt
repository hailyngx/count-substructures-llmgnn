Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are four 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are:

<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<2, (1, 3, 4)>
<3, (1, 2, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
