Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of 3-star configurations in this graph can be evaluated by counting the number of nodes that are directly connected to exactly three other nodes. In this case, there are three such configurations. 

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<1, (0, 3, 7)>
<9, (1, 3, 6)>

Therefore, the final answer is [3].
