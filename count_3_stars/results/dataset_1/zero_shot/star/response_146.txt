Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 4) (9, 0) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph. 

<0, (6, 9, 0)>
<1, (2, 4, 1)>
<2, (1, 4, 2)>
<4, (1, 2, 4)>
