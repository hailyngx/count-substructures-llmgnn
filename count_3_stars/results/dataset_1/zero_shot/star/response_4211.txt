Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

  0 - 6       5 - 8
  |           |    
  6 - 5 - 8   | 
        |     |
        5     7
               |
               1 - 2 - 4 - 9

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [4], and the unique 3-stars found are <5, (6, 5, 8)>, <6, (0, 5, 6)>, <7, (1, 7, 8)>, and <8, (5, 7, 8)>.
