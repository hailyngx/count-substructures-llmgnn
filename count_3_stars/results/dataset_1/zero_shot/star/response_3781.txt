Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 3-star structures in a graph represented by a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's identify them in the provided graph.

Given Edges:
(0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5)

Based on the given edges, the 3-star structures in the graph are:
<0, (7, 2, 1)>
<1, (2, 8, 7)>
<2, (1, 8, 9)>
<3, (6, 8, 5)>
<4, (8)>
<5, (6, 9)>
<6, (3, 5, 7)>
<7, (0, 2, 6)>
<8, (1, 2, 3)>
<9, (2, 5)>

Thus, there are 10 unique 3-star structures in the given graph. Therefore, the final answer is [10].
