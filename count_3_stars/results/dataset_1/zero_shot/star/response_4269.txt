Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) 

Response:
We will look for all the 3-stars in the given graph. Since a 3-star graph consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes, we need to find all possible combinations of such structures in the given graph. 

Let's list the 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<0, (1, 8, 7)>
<3, (0, 2, 8)>
<3, (0, 4, 6)>
<4, (0, 5, 6)>
<6, (3, 4, 5)>
<7, (1, 2, 5)>
<7, (1, 5, 8)>
