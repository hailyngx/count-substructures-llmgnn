Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph can be counted by finding all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

By examining the graph, we can identify the following 3-stars: 
<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<1, (0, 6, 7)>
<2, (4, 6, 8)>
<3, (0, 5, 7)>
<4, (0, 2, 6)>
<5, (0, 3, 6)>
<6, (1, 2, 4)>
<7, (1, 3, 6)>
<8, (0, 2, 7)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
