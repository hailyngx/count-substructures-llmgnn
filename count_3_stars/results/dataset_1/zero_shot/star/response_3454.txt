Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are <0, (1, 2, 5)>, <3, (2, 4, 6)>, and <3, (4, 7, 9)> 3-stars in the graph. 
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
