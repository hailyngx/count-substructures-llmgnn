Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<2, (0, 3, 9)>
<4, (0, 5, 6)>
