Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
The 3-stars are <0, (1, 3, 9)> and <5, (1, 4, 6)>.
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
