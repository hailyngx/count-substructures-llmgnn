Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are 3 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The count is [3].
   
    <0, (4, 8, 1)>
    <2, (5, 6, 9)>
    <3, (1, 9, 4)>
