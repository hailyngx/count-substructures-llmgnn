Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are:

[<0, (1, 2, 4)>, <1, (0, 5, 6)>, <2, (0, 5, 7)>, <4, (0, 9, 9)>, <5, (1, 2, 7)>, <6, (1, 9, 9)>, <7, (2, 5, 8)>, <8, (7, 9, 9)>, <9, (1, 4, 6)>]

Therefore, there are [9] 3-star graphs in the given graph.
