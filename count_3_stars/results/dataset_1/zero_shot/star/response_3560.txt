Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
There are [<1, (3, 8, 9)>, <2, (6, 7, 9)>] 3-stars in the given graph.
