Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are listed inside brackets:

[<0, (1, 9, 1)>, <1, (0, 9, 6)>, <2, (4, 7, 8)>, <4, (2, 5, 5)>, <6, (8, 9, 9)>, <8, (2, 6, 9)>]
