Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (3, 9, 5)>
<5, (3, 4, 6)>
<7, (3, 5, 9)>
<8, (2, 6, 9)>
