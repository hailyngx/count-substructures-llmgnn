Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) 

Response:
The answer is [6].

The unique 3-stars found in the given graph are:
    <0, (3, 4, 7)>
    <0, (7, 4, 8)>
    <1, (2, 5, 7)>
    <2, (1, 5, 7)>
    <2, (5, 1, 7)>
    <7, (0, 1, 2)>
