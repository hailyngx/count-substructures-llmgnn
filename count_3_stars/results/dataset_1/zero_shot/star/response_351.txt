Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are two 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<3, (1, 4, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
