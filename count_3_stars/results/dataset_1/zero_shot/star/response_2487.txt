Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
The graph can be visualized as follows:
```
    0 --- 2 --- 6 --- 9
    |     |           |
    9     7 --- 1 --- 4
                  |
                  5
```

In this graph, we can identify the following 3-stars:
1. <0, (2, 6, 9)>
2. <2, (0, 6, 7)>
3. <6, (2, 7, 9)>
4. <9, (0, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
