Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph can be calculated by counting the number of nodes that are the center of a 3-star configuration. Since each 3-star has one central node and three leaves, we can identify the 3-stars by finding nodes with exactly three neighbors.

Calculating the number of 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors (1, 2, 4)
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors (0, 2, 5, 6)
- Node 2 has 6 neighbors (0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6)
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors (2, 4, 7, 9)
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors (0, 2, 3, 7)
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors (1, 2, 7, 9)
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors (1, 2, 7)
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors (3, 4, 5, 6)
- Node 8 has 1 neighbor (9)
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors (3, 5, 8)

Thus, there are 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph: <0, (1, 2, 4)>, <1, (0, 2, 5)>, <2, (0, 1, 3)>, <3, (2, 4, 7)>, and <5, (1, 2, 7)>. Therefore, the final answer is [5].
