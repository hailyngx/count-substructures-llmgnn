Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 2) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are [9] 3-stars in the given graph.

These 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 8, 1)>
<1, (3, 6, 7)>
<2, (4, 5, 7)>
<3, (0, 1, 6)>
<4, (2, 5, 7)>
<5, (2, 4, 7)>
<6, (1, 7, 8)>
<7, (1, 6, 2)>
<8, (0, 6, 3)>
