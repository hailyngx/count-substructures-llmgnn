Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are a total of [10] nodes and [36] edges in the given graph. Let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph.

By definition, a 3-star consists of the central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list the 3-stars we can find in this graph:

1. <0, (4, 6, 8)>
2. <1, (4, 5, 9)>
3. <2, (3, 5, 6)>
4. <2, (5, 7, 9)>
5. <4, (0, 7, 8)>
6. <7, (2, 3, 5)>
7. <9, (1, 2, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars in this graph is [7].
