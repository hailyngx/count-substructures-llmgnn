Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [7].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<0, (2, 5, 9)>
<0, (3, 5, 9)>
<2, (0, 4, 7)>
<2, (0, 6, 7)>
<2, (0, 7, 9)>
