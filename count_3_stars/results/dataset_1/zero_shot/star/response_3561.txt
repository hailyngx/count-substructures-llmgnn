Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be represented as the number of nodes with degree at least 3. Let's find the 3-stars by listing the unique combinations:

There are 4 nodes with degree at least 3: node 1, node 5, node 6, and node 8. Each of these nodes can be the center of a 3-star. 

So, the 3-stars in the graph are <1, (5, 6, 8)>, <5, (1, 8, 9)>, <6, (0, 1, 2)>, and <8, (1, 4, 5)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
