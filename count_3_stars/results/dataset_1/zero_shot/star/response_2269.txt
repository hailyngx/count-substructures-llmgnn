Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in this graph: <1, (2, 3, 5)>, <3, (1, 2, 4)>, <3, (1, 4, 6)>, and <3, (4, 6, 7)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
