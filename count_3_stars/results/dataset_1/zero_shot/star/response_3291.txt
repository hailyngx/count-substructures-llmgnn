Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph.

Here are the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<1, (0, 4, 9)>
<2, (3, 6, 7)>
<3, (2, 6, 8)>
<4, (0, 1, 7)>
<5, (0, 7, 9)>
