Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<1, (0, 2, 8)>
<2, (0, 1, 6)>
<4, (0, 7, 8)>
<5, (0, 1, 7)>
<6, (2, 8, 9)>
<7, (0, 3, 4)>
<8, (1, 2, 4)>
