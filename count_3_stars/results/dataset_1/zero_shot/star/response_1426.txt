Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph. The unique 3-stars are <0, (1, 2, 5)>, <2, (0, 3, 7)>, <3, (2, 5, 7)>, and <4, (8, 9, 7)>.
