Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph contains the following 3-stars:
[<0, (1, 3, 7)>, <3, (0, 2, 7)>, <5, (4, 8, 5)>, <6, (7, 8, 6)>, <7, (0, 3, 6)>, <8, (5, 6, 7)>] 

Therefore, there are a total of [6] 3-stars in the graph.
