Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are:

<0, (1, 2, 6)>
<1, (0, 2, 5)>
<2, (0, 1, 8)>
<6, (0, 8, 9)>
<7, (0, 4, 5)>
<8, (2, 6, 9)>
<9, (1, 6, 7)>

Therefore, there are a total of [7] 3-stars in the graph.
