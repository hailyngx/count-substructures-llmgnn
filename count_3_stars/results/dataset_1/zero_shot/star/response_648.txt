Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here is the list of these 3-stars:
    
    <0, (6, 8, 1)>
    <1, (6, 9, 0)>
    <2, (3, 4, 7)>
    <3, (2, 7, 5)>
    <4, (2, 5, 8)>
    <7, (2, 3, 5)>

Therefore, the final answer is [6].
