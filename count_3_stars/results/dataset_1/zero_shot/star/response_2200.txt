Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the graph you provided. The answer is [6].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<1, (0, 2, 6)>
<2, (1, 3, 6)>
<3, (2, 4, 9)>
<4, (3, 8, 9)>
<9, (0, 2, 7)>
