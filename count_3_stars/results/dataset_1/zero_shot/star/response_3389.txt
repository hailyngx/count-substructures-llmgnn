Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are [2] 3-stars in the given graph. 

Here are the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (3, 4, 9)>
<2, (5, 8, 9)>
