Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in this graph. Here are the 3-stars found: 
<0, (1, 5, 9)>
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<5, (0, 2, 8)>
<6, (5, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 4. 
Hence, the final answer is [4].
