Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 6, 9)>
<1, (2, 6, 7)>
<2, (0, 1, 4)>
<3, (5, 6, 8)>
<9, (0, 2, 8)>
