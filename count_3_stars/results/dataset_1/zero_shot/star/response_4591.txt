Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
    
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0,(7, 9)>
<3,(4, 6, 7)>
<4,(3, 7, 8)>
<6,(1, 2, 9)>
<7,(0, 4, 5)>
<8,(4, 7)>
