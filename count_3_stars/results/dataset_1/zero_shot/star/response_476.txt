Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are a total of 3-stars in the given graph. The unique 3-stars are:
    
    <0, (1, 7, 0)>
    <1, (0, 2, 3)>
    <4, (1, 5, 8)> 
    
    So the final answer is [3].
