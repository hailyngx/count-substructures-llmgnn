Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are as follows:
[<0, (2, 7, 1)>, <1, (7, 8, 9)>, <3, (4, 6, 8)>]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
