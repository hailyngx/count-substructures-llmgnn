Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 2, 7)>
<1, (0, 2, 9)>
<2, (0, 1, 5)>
<2, (0, 5, 6)>
<6, (2, 7, 8)>
<8, (4, 5, 6)>
