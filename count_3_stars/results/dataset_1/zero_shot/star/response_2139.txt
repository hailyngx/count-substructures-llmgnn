Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The central node of a 3-star can be any node in the graph. Let's go through each node and check its adjacent nodes to see if it forms a 3-star.

1. Node 0:
   No 3-star around node 0.

2. Node 1:
   <1, (4, 5, 6)>

3. Node 2:
   No 3-star around node 2.

4. Node 3:
   No 3-star around node 3.

5. Node 4:
   <4, (1, 2, 6)>
   <4, (1, 7, 9)>

6. Node 5:
   <5, (0, 1, 6)>

7. Node 6:
   <6, (0, 1, 5)>
   <6, (1, 4, 9)>

8. Node 7:
   No 3-star around node 7.

9. Node 8:
   No 3-star around node 8.

10. Node 9:
   <9, (1, 3, 4)>
   <9, (1, 4, 6)>

Thus, there are a total of [7] 3-stars in the graph.
