Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 1) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph.  
The 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 6, 7)>
<1, (3, 4, 6)>
<6, (0, 1, 9)>
<7, (0, 5, 8)>
Therefore, the final answer is [4].
