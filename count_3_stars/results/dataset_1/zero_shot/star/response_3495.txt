Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are:

<0, (1, 3, 9)>
<1, (0, 6, 8)>
<3, (0, 6, 8)>
<9, (0, 2, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4].
