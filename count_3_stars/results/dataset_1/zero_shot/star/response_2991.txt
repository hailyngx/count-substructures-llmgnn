Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [5] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 7, 1)>
<2, (0, 1, 6)>
<4, (3, 7, 8)>
<6, (1, 2, 7)>
<8, (4, 6, 9)>
