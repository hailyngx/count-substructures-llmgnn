Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-star structures:
[<1, (4, 7, 5)> <2, (5, 8, 3)> <3, (5, 7, 9)> <4, (7, 8, 5)> <5, (7, 8, 9)>]

Therefore, there are a total of [5] 3-star structures in the graph.
