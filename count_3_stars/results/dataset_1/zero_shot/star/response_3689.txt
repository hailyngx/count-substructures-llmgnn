Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. To count the number of 3-stars, we need to identify central nodes connected to exactly three other nodes.

From the provided edges, we observe the following 3-stars:
1. <0, (2, 4, 8)>
2. <0, (2, 4, 9)>
3. <0, (4, 8, 9)>
4. <1, (3, 7, 9)>
5. <2, (0, 4, 7)>
6. <3, (1, 5, 9)>
7. <4, (0, 2, 9)>
8. <5, (3, 6, 9)>
9. <6, (5, 7, 9)>
10. <7, (1, 2, 8)>
11. <8, (0, 7, 9)>
12. <9, (0, 1, 4)>
13. <9, (1, 6, 9)>

Hence, there are a total of [13] 3-stars in the given graph.
