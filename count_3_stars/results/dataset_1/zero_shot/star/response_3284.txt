Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 1) (4, 7) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are [2] 3-stars in the given graph. The unique 3-stars are <0, (1, 7, 8)> and <1, (0, 3, 7)>.
