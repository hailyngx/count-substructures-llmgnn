Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) 

Response:
The graph is as follows:
```
   0 -- 9
   |       
   |        
   9 -- 0

1 -- 6 -- 8  
|    |    |  
|    |    |  
6 -- 1    7   
|         |   
|         |   
8 -- 7 -- 3 -- 4
       |    |
       |    |
       8 -- 2
```

To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we will need to identify each unique 3-star. 
Let's find all the 3-stars:
1. <0, (9, 0, 9)>
2. <1, (6, 1, 8)>
3. <1, (8, 6, 7)>
4. <3, (2, 3, 7)>
5. <3, (4, 3, 8)>
6. <3, (7, 3, 8)>
7. <6, (1, 6, 8)>
8. <6, (8, 6, 7)>
9. <7, (3, 7, 8)>
10. <8, (6, 8, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [10].
