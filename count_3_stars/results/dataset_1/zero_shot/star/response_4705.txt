Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 6) (3, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 3) (9, 1) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (5, 6, 2)>
<1, (7, 3, 9)>
<2, (5, 6, 0)>
<3, (6, 7, 1)>
<5, (6, 0, 2)>
<6, (0, 5, 3)>
<7, (1, 3, 9)>
<9, (1, 7, 3)>
