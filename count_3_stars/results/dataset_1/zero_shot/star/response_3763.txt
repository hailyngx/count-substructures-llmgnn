Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 3 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
The 3-stars are:
<0, (5, 9, 1)>
<3, (6, 7, 9)>
<1, (2, 5, 8)>

Therefore, the final answer is [3].
