Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 12 unique 3-stars in this graph. The count is [12].
   <0, (4, 7, 1)>, <1, (3, 5, 4)>, <2, (4, 5, 6)>, <3, (1, 5, 8)>, <4, (0, 2, 1)>, <5, (1, 4, 3)>, <6, (4, 5, 7)>, <7, (0, 6, 4)>, <8, (3, 4, 9)>, <9, (4, 8, 5)>, <3, (5, 9, 8)>, <4, (9, 5, 6)>
