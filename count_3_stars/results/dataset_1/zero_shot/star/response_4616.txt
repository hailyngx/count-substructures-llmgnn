Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are a total of 4 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<1, (0, 6, 7)>
<3, (0, 5, 7)>
<5, (0, 2, 3)>

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
