Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph. 
The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 8, 1)>
<1, (2, 4, 9)>
<2, (0, 1, 7)>
<5, (7, 8, 9)>
<6, (8, 9, 5)>
<9, (1, 3, 6)>
