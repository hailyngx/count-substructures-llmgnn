Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].  
<0, (6, 7, 8)>, <1, (2, 8, 9)>, <2, (1, 7, 8)>, <4, (5, 6, 8)>, <6, (0, 3, 5)>, <8, (0, 2, 4)>
