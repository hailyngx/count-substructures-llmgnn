Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 5) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<0, (3, 6, 9)>
<3, (0, 4, 8)>
<6, (0, 1, 2)>
