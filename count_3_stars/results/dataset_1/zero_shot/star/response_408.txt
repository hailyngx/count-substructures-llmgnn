Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are listed below:

<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<1, (0, 4, 5)>
<5, (1, 3, 7)>
<7, (0, 4, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
