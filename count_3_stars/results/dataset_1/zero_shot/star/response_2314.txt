Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph can be counted by identifying all the possible combinations of a central node and three leaves connected to it. Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<1, (0, 5, 6)>
<2, (3, 4, 5)>
<4, (0, 2, 8)>
<5, (1, 2, 6)>
<6, (0, 2, 5)>
<7, (2, 6, 8)>
<8, (4, 7, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
