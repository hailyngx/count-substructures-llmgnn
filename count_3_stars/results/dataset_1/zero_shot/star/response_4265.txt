Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 3-star graphs in the given graph. Let's list them first:

<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<1, (0, 4, 8)>
<2, (0, 6, 7)>
<4, (0, 1, 8)>
<6, (2, 3, 9)>
<7, (2, 3, 5)>
<8, (1, 4, -)>
<9, (0, 2, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [8].
