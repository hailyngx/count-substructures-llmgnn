Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.  

The unique 3-stars are:  
<0, (1, 6, 7)>  
<1, (0, 4, 6)>  
<3, (4, 8, 9)>  
<9, (0, 6, 7)>
