Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The 3-stars in this graph can be represented as follows:
1. <0, (1, 4, 5)>
2. <1, (0, 4, 6)>
3. <4, (0, 1, 9)>
4. <5, (0, 6, -)>
5. <6, (1, 5, 8)>
6. <7, (1, 3, 9)>
7. <8, (6, -, -)>
8. <9, (0, 4, 7)>

Therefore, there are a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
