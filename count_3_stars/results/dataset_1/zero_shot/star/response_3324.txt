Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (5, 8, 9)>
<2, (3, 4, 7)>
<7, (2, 3, 8)>
<8, (1, 2, 7)>
<9, (1, 3, 7)>
<3, (2, 7, 9)>
