Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [7] 3-stars in the given graph.  
The unique 3-stars are:  
<0, (4, 8, 9)>  
<3, (5, 6, 7)>  
<4, (0, 6, 7)>  
<5, (2, 3, 6)>  
<6, (1, 3, 5)>  
<6, (4, 7, 8)>  
<6, (8, 9, 0)>
