Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

The 3-stars are:
<1, (0, 3, 6)>
<3, (1, 4, 5)>
<4, (2, 7, 9)>
<7, (3, 4, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [4].
