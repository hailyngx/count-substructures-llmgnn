Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars and their counts:

[<0, (2, 4, 6)>, <0, (4, 6, 7)>, <4, (0, 5, 6)>, <4, (1, 5, 9)>, <8, (3, 5, 9)>]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [5].
