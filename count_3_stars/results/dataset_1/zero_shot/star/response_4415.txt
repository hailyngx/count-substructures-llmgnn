Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the final answer is [6].
    
The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 2, 9)>
<2, (0, 1, 4)>
<4, (2, 3, 6)>
<5, (0, 6, 7)>
<6, (4, 5, 8)>
<8, (4, 6, 9)>
