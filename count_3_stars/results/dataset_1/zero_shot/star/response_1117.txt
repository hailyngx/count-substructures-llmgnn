Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in this graph. The 3-stars are:
<1, (2, 7, 8)>
<2, (1, 8, 9)>
<3, (5, 7, 9)>
<6, (0, 4, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
