Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
Counting the number of 3-stars in the given graph:
There are three 3-stars in the graph.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 5, 8)>
<3, (7, 8, 9)>
<1, (2, 9, 3)>

Therefore, the final answer is [3].
