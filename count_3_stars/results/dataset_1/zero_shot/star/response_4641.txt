Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 9) (7, 4) (7, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph. The unique 3-stars are <0, (1, 2, 4)>, <1, (0, 5, 9)>, <2, (0, 9, 5)>, and <4, (0, 7, 9)>.
