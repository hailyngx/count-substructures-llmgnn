Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-star patterns in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 3, 5)>
<1, (2, 3, 5)>
<3, (0, 1, 8)>
<8, (0, 1, 3)>
