Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
There is a total of [15] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 5, 1)>
<1, (3, 4, 9)>
<2, (0, 4, 7)>
<4, (1, 3, 6)>
<6, (4, 8, 8)>
<8, (1, 9, 6)>
