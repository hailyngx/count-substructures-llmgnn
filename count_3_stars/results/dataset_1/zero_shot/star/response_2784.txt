Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph contains four 3-stars. Here are the unique 3-stars found: 

<0, (5, 4, 8)>
<1, (4, 8, 5)>
<3, (6, 9, 8)>
<2, (9, 6, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
