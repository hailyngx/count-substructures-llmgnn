Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are [8] 3-stars in the given graph. 

Unique 3-stars: 
<0, (3, 6, 9)>
<1, (5, 7, 8)>
<3, (0, 4, 5)>
<3, (4, 5, 7)>
<3, (5, 6, 7)>
<4, (3, 5, 9)>
<5, (1, 3, 7)>
<6, (0, 3, 9)>
