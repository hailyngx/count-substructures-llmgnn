Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of 3-star structures in this graph is [2].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are <0, (4, 5, 6)> and <6, (1, 8, 9)>.
