Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (7, 9, 0)>
<1, (2, 3, 4)>
<1, (3, 4, 8)>
<4, (1, 7, 8)>
<7, (0, 2, 4)>
<8, (1, 4, 7)>
