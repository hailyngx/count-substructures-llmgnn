Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 3-star subgraphs in the given graph. Here is the list of unique 3-stars:

<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<2, (3, 4, 7)>
<4, (2, 3, 6)>
<5, (0, 6, 7)>  
<7, (1, 2, 5)>  

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
