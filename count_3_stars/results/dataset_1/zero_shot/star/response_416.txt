Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 3 unique 3-stars in this graph. The 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 8, 9)>
<1, (4, 6, 9)>
<4, (0, 1, 2)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
