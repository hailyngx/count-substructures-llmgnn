Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The goal is to count the number of 3-stars in the given graph by identifying the central node and the three connected nodes.

We will analyze each node in the graph to see if it forms a 3-star with its connected nodes. Let's list the unique 3-stars found:

<2, (1, 3, 4)>
<3, (2, 4, 6)>
<4, (2, 3, 8)>
<5, (0, 1, 7)>
<6, (3, 8, 9)>
<8, (3, 4, 6)>
<9, (6, 8, 9)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we get a total of [7].
