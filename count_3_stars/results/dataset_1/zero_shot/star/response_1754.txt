Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph can be counted by first identifying all the 3-stars based on the definition provided. Let's do this together:

1. Node 0: (0, 3, 7), (0, 3, 8)
2. Node 1: (1, 6, 8)
3. Node 3: (3, 0, 6), (3, 4, 6)
4. Node 4: (4, 3, 9)
5. Node 5: (5, 6, 9)
6. Node 6: (6, 1, 9)
7. Node 8: (8, 1, 3)

Hence, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are:
<0, 3, 7>, <0, 3, 8>, <1, 6, 8>, <3, 0, 6>, <3, 4, 6>, <4, 3, 9>, <5, 6, 9>, <6, 1, 9>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
