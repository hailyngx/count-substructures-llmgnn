Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The central nodes in this graph are: 0, 2, 4, 5, and 8.

The 3-stars in this graph are:
<0, (1, 8, 4)>
<4, (0, 7, 9)>
<8, (0, 2, 9)>
<2, (1, 3, 5)>
<9, (4, 8, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
