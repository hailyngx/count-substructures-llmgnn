Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 2 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (4, 9, 3)>
<5, (7, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the final answer is [2].
