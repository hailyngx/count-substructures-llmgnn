Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<1, (0, 5, 7)>
<2, (0, 6, 8)>
<3, (0, 4, 7)>
<5, (0, 1, 6)>
<6, (2, 5, 9)>
<7, (1, 3, 5)>
<8, (1, 2, 3)>
<9, (2, 6, 7)>
