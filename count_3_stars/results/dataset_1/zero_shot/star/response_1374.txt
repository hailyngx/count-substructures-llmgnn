Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:
[<0, (3, 5, 6)>, <1, (4, 2, 5)>, <2, (4, 1, 5)>, <3, (0, 4, 7)>, <4, (1, 2, 6)>, <5, (0, 1, 8)>, <6, (0, 4, 8)>, <7, (2, 3, 8)>, <8, (3, 5, 6)>, <9, (3, 4, 9)>]
Hence, there are 10 3-stars in this graph.
