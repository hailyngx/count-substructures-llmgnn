Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 3-stars in the given graph. Here is the count and the list of unique 3-stars:

[6]

<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<1, (0, 6, 7)>
<2, (0, 4, 5)>
<3, (2, 6, 7)>
<4, (0, 7, 9)>
<5, (0, 2, 8)>
