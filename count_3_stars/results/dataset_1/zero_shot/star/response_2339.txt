Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are:
   
   - <0, (4, 8, 6)>
   - <2, (3, 5, 7)>
   - <6, (1, 4, 8)>
   - <8, (0, 4, 6)>
   
Count of 3-star graphs: [4]
