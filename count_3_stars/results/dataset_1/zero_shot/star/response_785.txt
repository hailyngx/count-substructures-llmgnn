Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-star in the given graph is [8].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 1, 8)>
<1, (2, 0, 3)>
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<3, (1, 2, 5)>
<4, (7, 8, 9)>
<5, (2, 3, 6)>
<6, (2, 3, 7)>
<7, (2, 4, 9)>
