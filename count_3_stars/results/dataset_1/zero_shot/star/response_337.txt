Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
There are 6 3-stars in the given graph.
The unique 3-stars are: <0, (1, 4, 5)>, <1, (0, 2, 8)>, <2, (1, 5, 8)>, <3, (7, 8, 6)>, <4, (0, 5, 1)>, <5, (2, 4, 7)>.
