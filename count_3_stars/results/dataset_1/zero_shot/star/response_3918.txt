Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The final answer is [6].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<4, (0, 1, 5)>
<6, (0, 2, 3)>
<7, (1, 3, 0)>
<8, (0, 2, 9)>
