Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:
[<0, (6, 7, 9)>, <1, (4, 9, 1)>, <3, (4, 5, 6)>, <4, (1, 2, 3)>] 

There are a total of [4] 3-stars in this graph.
