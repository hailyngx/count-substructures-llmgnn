Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (5, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The 3-stars are:

<0, (3, 9, 7)>
<2, (5, 7, 8)>
<3, (0, 9, 7)>
<6, (8, 9, 3)>

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
