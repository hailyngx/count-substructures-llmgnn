Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
There are 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph.  

The 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 3, 9)>
<1, (4, 6, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
