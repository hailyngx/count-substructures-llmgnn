Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph. We can represent them as follows:
<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<1, (0, 2, 5)>
<2, (1, 5, 8)>
<3, (0, 6, 8)>
<5, (0, 1, 2)>
<8, (1, 2, 9)>
