Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (4, 6, 8)>
<1, (4, 7, 9)>
<2, (5, 9, -)>
where "-" signifies that one of the leaf nodes is not specified.
