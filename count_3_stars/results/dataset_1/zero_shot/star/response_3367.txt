Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph. 
The unique 3-stars are <0, (1, 5, 6)>, <4, (0, 2, 5)>, <4, (7, 6, 9)>, and <5, (1, 4, 0)>.
