Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are three 3-stars in the given graph. So, the final count is [3].
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are <0, (5, 9, 6)>, <4, (3, 6, 9)>, and <8, (1, 7, 9)>.
