Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
    
The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (2, 5, 8)>
<2, (1, 4, 9)>
