Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in this graph.  

The 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 8, 1)>
<1, (4, 5, 8)>
<2, (4, 6, 7)>
<3, (0, 8, 1)>
<4, (1, 5, 7)>
<5, (1, 4, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [6].
