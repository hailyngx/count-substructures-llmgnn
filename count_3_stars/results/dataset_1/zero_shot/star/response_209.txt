Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is: [4]

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<2, (0, 3, 5)>
<3, (2, 4, 8)>
<6, (1, 7, 8)>
<8, (1, 3, 6)>
