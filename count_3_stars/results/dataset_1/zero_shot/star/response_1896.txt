Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (7, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are:

[<0, (5, 7, 4)>, <2, (3, 9, 9)>, <4, (5, 8, 8)>, <8, (4, 9, 9)>]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
