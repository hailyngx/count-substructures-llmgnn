Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The central nodes in each 3-star can only be nodes that are directly connected to exactly 3 other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars present in the given graph.

The nodes directly connected to exactly 3 other nodes are: 2, 5, 7, and 9.

So, we have the following 3-star configurations:

<2, (0, 5, 7)>
<5, (1, 2, 7)>
<7, (5, 9, 1)>
<9, (3, 7, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
