Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (9, 1) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2 and 5.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2 and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0 and 1.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 4 and 7.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 6, and 7.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 7.
- Node 6 is connected to node 4.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 5.
- Node 9 is connected to node 1.

To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the centers and their corresponding leaves. 

The 3-stars in the graph are:
- <0, (2, 5, 4)>
- <1, (2, 9, *)> (Node 1 only has 2 neighbors)
- <3, (4, 7, *)> (Node 3 only has 2 neighbors)
- <5, (0, 4, 7)>
- <9, (1, *)> (Node 9 only has 1 neighbor)

Counting these unique 3-stars, we get a total of [4].
