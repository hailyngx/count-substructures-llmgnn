Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be determined by counting the number of nodes which can act as the center of a 3-star. In this case, nodes with exactly three neighbors can serve as the center of a 3-star.

Upon examining the provided graph:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors (1, 5, 6).
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors (5, 6, 8).
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors.

Therefore, only nodes 0 and 4 can act as the center of a 3-star. Hence, there are two unique 3-stars in this graph:
<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<4, (5, 6, 8)>

Thus, there are [2] 3-stars in total.
