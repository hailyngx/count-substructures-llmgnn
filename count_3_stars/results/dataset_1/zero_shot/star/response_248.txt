Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated by counting the number of central nodes in the graph. Since each 3-star contains one central node, we can count the number of nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

In the given graph:
- Node 0 is connected to 4 other nodes (nodes 2, 3, 4, 7).
- Node 1 is connected to 3 other nodes (nodes 4, 5, 9).
- Node 2 is connected to 2 other nodes (nodes 0, 5).
- Node 3 is connected to 3 other nodes (nodes 0, 5, 7).
- Node 4 is connected to 5 other nodes (nodes 0, 1, 5, 6, 7).
- Node 5 is connected to 6 other nodes (nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7).
- Node 6 is connected to 3 other nodes (nodes 4, 5, 8).
- Node 7 is connected to 4 other nodes (nodes 0, 3, 4, 5).
- Node 8 is connected to 2 other nodes (nodes 6, 9).
- Node 9 is connected to 2 other nodes (nodes 1, 8).

Thus, there are <0, (2, 3, 4)>, <1, (4, 5, 9)>, <4, (0, 5, 6)>, and <5, (1, 2, 3)> as the unique 3-stars. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
