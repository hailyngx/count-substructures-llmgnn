Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<1, (0, 4, 9)>
<4, (1, 6, 7)>
<5, (0, 2, 6)>
<6, (3, 4, 5)>
<7, (0, 4, 9)>
<9, (1, 5, 7)>
<9, (5, 6, 7)>
