Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be found by looking at the nodes and their connections. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<1, (0, 9, 5)>
<2, (4, 6, 8)>
<3, (0, 6, 5)>
<4, (2, 5, 6)>
<5, (0, 4, 7)>
<6, (2, 3, 4)>
<8, (2, 6, 5)>
<9, (0, 1, 5)>

There are 9 unique 3-stars in the given graph, so the final answer is [9].
