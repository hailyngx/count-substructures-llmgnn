Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 3) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are <0, (2, 9, 1)>, <1, (2, 6, 9)>, and <2, (0, 1, 8)> 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
