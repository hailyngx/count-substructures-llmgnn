Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
    
    Unique 3-stars:
    <0, (1, 3, 9)>
    <1, (0, 4, -)>
    <3, (0, 4, -)>
    <4, (1, 3, -)>
    <6, (2, 8, -)>
    <7, (8, 9, -)>
    <8, (6, 7, 9)>
