Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 6, 1)>
<2, (5, 7, 9)>
<4, (1, 6, 8)>
