Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (5, 8, 9)>
<3, (5, 6, 8)>
<4, (5, 8, 9)>
<5, (0, 3, 4)>
<8, (0, 1, 3)>
<9, (0, 4, 7)>
<6, (3, 5, 8)>
<7, (9, 2, 0)>
<1, (8, 0, 3)>
<2, (9, 7, 0)>
<8, (1, 0, 4)>
<9, (2, 4, 5)>
