Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 12 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here is the list of unique 3-stars:
    <0, (1, 6, 7)>
    <1, (0, 7, 9)>
    <2, (5, 7, 9)>
    <3, (5, 8, 9)>
    <5, (2, 3, 9)>
    <6, (0, 8, 7)>
    <7, (0, 1, 2)>
    <8, (1, 3, 6)>
    <9, (0, 1, 2)>
    <9, (0, 3, 5)>
    <9, (1, 2, 3)>
    <9, (5, 2, 3)>
  
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
