Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are:
<1, (3, 6, 7)>
<3, (1, 5, 6)>
<5, (2, 3, 4)>
<6, (1, 3, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
