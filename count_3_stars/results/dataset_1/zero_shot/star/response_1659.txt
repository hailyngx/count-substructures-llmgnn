Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 3 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
The 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 4, 8)>
<1, (0, 5, 6)>
<9, (0, 3, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
