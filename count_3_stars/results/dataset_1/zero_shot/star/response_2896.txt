Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are a total of [4] 3-stars in the given graph.  

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 7, 1)>
<1, (4, 7, 2)>
<3, (0, 1, 5)>
<4, (1, 8, 9)>
