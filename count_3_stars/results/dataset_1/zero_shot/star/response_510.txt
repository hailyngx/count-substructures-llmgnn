Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are [2] 3-stars in the given graph. 
The unique 3-stars are <0, (2, 5, 8)> and <5, (1, 0, 9)>.
