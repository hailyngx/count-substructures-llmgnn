Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) 

Response:
The graph is as follows:
```
        1 -- 2
        |    |
        3 -- 5
       /|\  
      0 4 6
         |
         8
         |
         7
        /
       9
```

There are 4 unique 3-stars in this graph: 
<1, (2, 3, 5)>
<3, (1, 5, 0)>
<5, (0, 3, 4)>
<6, (1, 8, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4].
