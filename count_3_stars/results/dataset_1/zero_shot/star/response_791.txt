Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (2, 4, 8)>
<1, (6, 5, 8)>
<1, (7, 1, 8)>
<8, (1, 5, 9)>
