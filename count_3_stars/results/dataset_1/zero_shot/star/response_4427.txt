Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are listed below:

<0, (3, 5, 9)>
<1, (2, 3, 4)>
<1, (5, 6, 7)>
<3, (0, 1, 9)>
<4, (1, 5, 9)>
<6, (1, 5, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
