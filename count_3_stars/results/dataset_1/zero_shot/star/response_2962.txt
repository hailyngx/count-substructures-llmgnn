Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:
[<0, (1, 8, 6)> <1, (0, 7, 9)> <3, (4, 5, 9)> <4, (2, 3, 9)> <6, (8, 9, 0)> <9, (1, 4, 6)>] 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
