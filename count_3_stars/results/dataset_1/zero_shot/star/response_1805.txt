Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 2) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are listed below:

<0, (2, 3, 7)>
<2, (0, 3, 7)>
<3, (0, 2, 7)>
<7, (0, 2, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
