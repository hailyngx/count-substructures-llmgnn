Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 4 different 3-stars in the given graph. Below are the unique 3-stars found:

<0, (2, 5, 9)>
<1, (2, 4, 5)>
<3, (0, 4, 5)>
<5, (0, 3, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
