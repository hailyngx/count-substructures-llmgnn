Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are <0, (2, 5, 6)>, <2, (0, 8, 9)>, <3, (6, 7, 9)> 3-stars present in the given graph. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
