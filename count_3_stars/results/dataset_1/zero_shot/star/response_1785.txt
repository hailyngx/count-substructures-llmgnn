Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be determined by first identifying the central node of each 3-star. 
By analyzing the given edges, we can find the 3-stars as follows:

1. <0, (4, 8, 0)>
2. <1, (3, 5, 9)>
3. <2, (6, 9, 2)>
4. <3, (1, 4, 9)>
5. <4, (0, 3, 6)>
6. <5, (1, 7, 8)>
7. <6, (1, 2, 4)>
8. <9, (1, 2, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
