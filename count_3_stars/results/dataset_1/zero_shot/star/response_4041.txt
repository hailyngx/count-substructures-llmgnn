Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be calculated by counting the number of times each node appears as the center of a 3-star.

Upon counting the occurrences, we find that:
- Node 0 is the center of 1 3-star
- Node 1 is the center of 2 3-stars
- Node 2 is the center of 2 3-stars
- Node 4 is the center of 2 3-stars
- Node 6 is the center of 4 3-stars
- Node 8 is the center of 1 3-star
- Node 9 is the center of 1 3-star

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [13].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 6, 7)>
<1, (4, 6, 7)>
<1, (6, 7, 2)>
<2, (0, 4, 7)>
<2, (4, 1, 7)>
<4, (1, 2, 6)>
<4, (2, 1, 7)>
<6, (0, 1, 8)>
<6, (1, 4, 8)>
<6, (5, 8, 9)>
<6, (8, 5, 9)>
<8, (6, 5, 9)>
<9, (6, 5, 8)>
