Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in this graph is [3].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<1, (0, 2, 8)>
<2, (1, 7, 8)>
