Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 0) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The count is enclosed in brackets [] below.
    
    [<0, (1, 6, 8)>, <1, (0, 5, 8)>, <2, (3, 4, 5)>, <2, (8, 9, 8)>, <3, (2, 8, 8)>, <9, (7, 8, 9)>]
