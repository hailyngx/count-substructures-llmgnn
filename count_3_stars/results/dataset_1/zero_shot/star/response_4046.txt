Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [15] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<1, (3, 4, 6)>
<1, (4, 7, 9)>
<1, (4, 8, 9)>
<1, (6, 4, 1)>
<1, (6, 4, 7)>
<1, (6, 4, 8)>
<1, (7, 4, 8)>
<1, (9, 4, 8)>
<1, (9, 4, 7)>
