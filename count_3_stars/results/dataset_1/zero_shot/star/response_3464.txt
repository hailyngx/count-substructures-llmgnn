Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in this graph is 4. 
The unique 3-stars are: <0, (1, 2, 4)>, <2, (0, 1, 4)>, <4, (0, 1, 2)>, <7, (0, 1, 4)>.
Therefore, the final answer is [4].
