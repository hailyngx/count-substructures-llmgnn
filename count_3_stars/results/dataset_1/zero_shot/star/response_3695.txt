Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) 

Response:
There are 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph.
The 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 7, 8)>
<1, (0, 4, 6)>
<3, (6, 7, 8)>
<4, (1, 5, 6)>
<5, (4, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
