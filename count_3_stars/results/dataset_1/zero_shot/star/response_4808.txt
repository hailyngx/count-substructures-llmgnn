Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the graph. Here they are in no specific order:

<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<1, (0, 4, 7)>
<3, (0, 2, 4)>
<7, (0, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
