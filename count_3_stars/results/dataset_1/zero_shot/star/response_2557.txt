Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<1, (2, 3, 4)>
<2, (1, 7, 8)>
<4, (0, 6, 9)>
