Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) 

Response:
There are 5 unique 3-stars in this graph. Here is the list of unique 3-stars:

<0, (1, 2, 7)>
<2, (0, 5, 6)>
<3, (1, 5, 7)>
<4, (1, 6, 7)>
<7, (0, 2, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
