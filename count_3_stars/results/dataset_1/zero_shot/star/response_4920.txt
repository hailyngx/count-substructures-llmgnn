Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) 

Response:
There are 3-stars in this graph. The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (6, 2, 4)>
<7, (5, 8, 3)>
<8, (5, 7, 5)>

Therefore, there are a total of [3] 3-stars in the given graph.
