Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
The answer is [6].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (6, 8, 1)>
<2, (4, 1, 8)>
<2, (8, 3, 9)>
<4, (1, 6, 7)>
<4, (2, 7, 8)>
<8, (0, 3, 9)>
