Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be counted by looking for nodes with exactly 3 neighbors (excluding themselves). Let's list the unique 3-stars found in this graph:

1. <1, (0, 5, 7)>
2. <2, (3, 6, 1)>
3. <3, (2, 4, 6)>
4. <4, (3, 8, -)>
5. <5, (1, 8, 9)>
6. <6, (2, 3, 8)>
7. <7, (1, -,-)>
8. <9, (5, -,-)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [8].
