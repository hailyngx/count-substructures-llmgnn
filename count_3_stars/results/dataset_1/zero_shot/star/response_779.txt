Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 7) (2, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph can be found by identifying the central node and its three connected nodes for each 3-star structure.

Let's go through the edges and find all the 3-stars in the graph:

1. **Node 0**: (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8) --> <0, (6, 7, 8)>
2. **Node 1**: (1, 7) --> <1, (0, 3, 1)>
3. **Node 2**: (2, 6) --> <2, (6, 0, 8)>
4. **Node 3**: (3, 7), (3, 8) --> <3, (7, 0, 8)>
5. **Node 4**: (4, 9) --> <4, (9, 5, 7)>
6. **Node 5**: (5, 8), (5, 9) --> <5, (8, 0, 9)>
7. **Node 6**: (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 8) --> <6, (0, 2, 8)>
8. **Node 7**: (7, 0), (7, 1), (7, 3), (7, 9) --> <7, (0, 1, 3)>
9. **Node 8**: (8, 0), (8, 3), (8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 9) --> <8, (0, 3, 5)>
10. **Node 9**: (9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 7), (9, 8) --> <9, (4, 5, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
