Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be found by examining each node and counting how many 3-star patterns it belongs to.

Here are the 3-stars found in the given graph:
1. <0, (3, 7, 9)>
2. <1, (4, 7, 9)>
3. <2, (5, 6, 9)>
4. <3, (0, 9, 6)>
5. <4, (1, 7, 2)>

By counting the number of unique 3-stars, we find that there are [5] 3-stars in total.
