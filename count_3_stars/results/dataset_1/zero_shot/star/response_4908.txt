Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of 3-star configurations in the given graph can be determined as follows:
1. The center node can be any node out of the total 10 nodes in the graph.
2. For each chosen central node, we need to find the number of 3-stars associated with it.
3. For each central node, we look for its neighbors and count the number of 3-stars formed with these neighbors.

By examining the given edges, we can find all the unique 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (4, 6, 9)>
<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<1, (4, 5, 7)>
<1, (5, 6, 7)>
<1, (6, 7, 8)>
<2, (1, 8, 8)>
<4, (0, 1, 5)>
<4, (1, 5, 8)>
<4, (5, 6, 8)>
<6, (0, 1, 7)>
<6, (1, 4, 7)>
<6, (4, 7, 8)>
<8, (1, 2, 9)>
<8, (2, 4, 9)>

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
