Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:
[<0, (7, 8, 9)>, <1, (2, 5, 6)>, <2, (1, 4, 9)>, <3, (5, 8, -)>, <4, (2, 6, -)>, <5, (1, 3, -)>, <6, (1, 4, -)>, <7, (0, 9, -)>, <8, (0, 3, 9)>, <9, (2, 7, 8)>]

There are 10 3-stars in this graph. [10]
