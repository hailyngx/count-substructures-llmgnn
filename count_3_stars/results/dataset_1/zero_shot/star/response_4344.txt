Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 9) (7, 1) (8, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The list of unique 3-stars is as follows:

<0, (1, 4, 8)>
<9, (2, 3, 5)>

Therefore, the final answer is [2].
