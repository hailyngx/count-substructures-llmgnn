Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are:

<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<1, (4, 5, 6)>
<3, (7, 9, 5)>
<9, (2, 3, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
