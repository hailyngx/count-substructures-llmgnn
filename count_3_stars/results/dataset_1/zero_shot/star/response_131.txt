Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 4) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 2, 6)>
<4, (5, 7, 8)>
