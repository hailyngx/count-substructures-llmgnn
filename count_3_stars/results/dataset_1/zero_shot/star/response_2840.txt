Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in this graph.
The 3-stars are: <0, (1, 6, 9)>, <1, (0, 2, 7)>, <3, (5, 7, -)>, <4, (6, 7, -)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
