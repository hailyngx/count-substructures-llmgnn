Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-star subgraphs in the given graph:
    <0, (5, 6, 8)>
    <3, (4, 6, 7)>
    <3, (4, 8, 9)>
    <9, (1, 2, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
