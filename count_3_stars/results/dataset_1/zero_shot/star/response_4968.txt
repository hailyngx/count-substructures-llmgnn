Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph. 

<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<1, (0, 4, 6)>
<1, (0, 6, 7)>
<4, (1, 5, 6)>
<6, (1, 4, 7)>
<9, (1, 3, 6)>
