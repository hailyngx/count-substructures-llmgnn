Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 3-stars formed by nodes (0, 3, 8) and (0, 3, 9). Hence, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].  
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <0, (3, 8, 9)>, and <3, (0, 7, 9)>.
