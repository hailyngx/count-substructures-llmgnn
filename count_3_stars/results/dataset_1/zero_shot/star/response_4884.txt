Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are [3] 3-stars in the given graph.  

The unique 3-stars are:
<2, (1, 5, 6)>
<6, (2, 8, 9)>
<9, (2, 4, 6)>
