Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are:
<0, (4, 6, 8)>
<1, (3, 5, 7)>
<1, (5, 7, 9)>
<8, (0, 6, 9)>
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
