Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The graph representation can be given as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 5
- Node 1 is connected to node 9
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 9
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 5, 8, and 9
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 7, and 8
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 3
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 7, 8, and 9
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 6
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 6
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 6

To count the number of 3-stars, we need to find all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes through edges.

The 3-stars in the given graph are:
[<0, (3, 4, 5)>, <2, (3, 5, 9)>, <3, (0, 2, 5)>, <4, (0, 7, 8)>, <6, (7, 8, 9)>]

Count of 3-stars in the given graph: [5]
