Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are a total of [4] 3-stars in this graph.  
The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (5, 7, 9)>
<1, (2, 3, 8)>
<4, (3, 6, 8)>
<7, (0, 2, 9)>
