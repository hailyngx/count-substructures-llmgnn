Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph has 3-star subgraphs with the following centers and leaves:
<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<1, (2, 5, 8)>
<2, (1, 3, 8)>
<3, (2, 5, 8)>
<4, (0, 5, 8)>
<5, (0, 1, 3)>
<6, (0, 9, 5)>
<8, (1, 3, 4)>
<9, (3, 5, 6)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
