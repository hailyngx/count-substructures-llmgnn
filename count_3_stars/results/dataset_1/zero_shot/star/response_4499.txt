Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are as follows:
<0, (1, 7, 9)>
<1, (0, 7, 9)>
<2, (4, 7, 9)>
<3, (4, 6, 7)>
<4, (2, 3, 5)>
<5, (4, 7, 7)>
<6, (3, 7, 8)>
<7, (0, 1, 2)>
<8, (4, 6, 7)>
<9, (0, 1, 2)>

Thus, there are [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
