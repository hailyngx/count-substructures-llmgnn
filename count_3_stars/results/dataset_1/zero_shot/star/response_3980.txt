Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 5 different 3-stars in the given graph. The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 8, 3)>
<2, (3, 7, 6)>
<3, (0, 2, 5)>
<5, (2, 3, 6)>
<6, (2, 3, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
