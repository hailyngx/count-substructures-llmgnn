Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are:

<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<3, (0, 2, 8)>
<4, (2, 5, 6)>
<5, (4, 7, 9)>
<6, (4, 9, 6)>

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
