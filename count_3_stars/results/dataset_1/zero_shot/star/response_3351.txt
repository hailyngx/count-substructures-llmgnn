Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The graph contains the following 3-stars:
\[<0, (3, 8, 9)> <1, (2, 9, 2)> <2, (1, 9, 4)> <3, (0, 5, 6)> <4, (8, 9, 9)> <5, (3, 8, 7)> <6, (3, 9, 5)> <7, (5, 8, 5)> <8, (0, 2, 8)> <9, (1, 2, 6)>\]
Thus, there are 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the final answer is [10].
