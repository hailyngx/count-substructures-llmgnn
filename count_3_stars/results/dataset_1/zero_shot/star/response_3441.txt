Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph is as follows:

                 0
                 |
                 4
                /|\
               2 7 8
               | |
               9 1
                |
                5
                 |
                 6

There are 4 unique 3-stars in this graph, as listed below:

<0, (4, 2, 7)>
<1, (5, 9, 2)>
<2, (7, 4, 1)>
<9, (6, 1, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
