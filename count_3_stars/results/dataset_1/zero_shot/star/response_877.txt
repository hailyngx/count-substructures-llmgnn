Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) 

Response:
There are 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here are the 3-stars:

<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<3, (0, 2, 7)>
<4, (0, 7, 5)>
<5, (0, 1, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
