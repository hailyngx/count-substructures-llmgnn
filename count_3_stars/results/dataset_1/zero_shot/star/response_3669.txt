Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 8) (4, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
  
The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<1, (0, 2, 8)>
<1, (6, 8, 9)>
<3, (7, 8 9)>
<4, (8, 9, 9)>
