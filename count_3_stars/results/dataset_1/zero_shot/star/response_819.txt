Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are:
<0, (3, 7, 9)>
<1, (5, 6, 8)>
<2, (3, 6, 7)>
<4, (7, 8, 9)>
<5, (1, 3, 9)>
<6, (1, 2, 8)>
<8, (1, 4, 6)>
<9, (0, 2, 4)>

There are a total of 8 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the final answer is [8].
