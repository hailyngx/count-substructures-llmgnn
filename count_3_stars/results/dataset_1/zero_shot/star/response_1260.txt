Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.  

The unique 3-stars are:  
<0, (4, 7, 1)>  
<2, (4, 9, 7)>  
<5, (1, 4, 8)>  
<6, (7, 8, 6)>
