Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-star structures:

[<0, (1, 2, 4)>, <0, (1, 4, 6)>, <1, (0, 2, 4)>, <1, (0, 2, 9)>, <1, (2, 4, 9)>, <3, (2, 4, 7)>, <3, (4, 5, 7)>, <5, (3, 4, 9)>, <6, (0, 4, 9)>, <9, (1, 5, 6)>]

Therefore, the total number of 3-star structures in the given graph is [10].
