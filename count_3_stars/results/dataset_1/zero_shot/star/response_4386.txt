Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The answer is [4].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (5, 6, 8)>
<1, (4, 5, 7)>
<4, (1, 2, 6)>
<5, (0, 6, 8)>
