Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are <0, (3, 7, 8)> and <2, (1, 4, 5)> as the only 3-stars in the given graph. Hence, the count of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
