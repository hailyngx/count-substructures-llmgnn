Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 3-star structures present in the given graph. The unique 3-stars are:

<1, (0, 8, 7)>
<2, (9, 4, 8)>
<4, (2, 3, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
