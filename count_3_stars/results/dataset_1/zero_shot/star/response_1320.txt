Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph. Here are the unique 3-stars:
    <1, (2, 3, 5)>
    <1, (3, 4, 5)>
    <1, (5, 6, 8)>
    <3, (1, 4, 9)>
    <5, (1, 6, 8)>
    <9, (2, 3, 8)>
