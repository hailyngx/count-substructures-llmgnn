Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of 6 unique 3-stars in this graph. Here is the list of them:

<0, (6, 7, 8)>
<1, (4, 5, 7)>
<3, (4, 7, 9)>
<4, (1, 3, 6)>
<5, (1, 7, 0)>
<9, (7, 8, 0)>

Therefore, the final answer is [6].
