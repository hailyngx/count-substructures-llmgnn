Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 2) (8, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 2, 6)>
<2, (0, 3, 7)>
<2, (0, 8, 7)>
<2, (3, 7, 8)>
<3, (2, 4, 8)>
<4, (3, 6, 9)>
<4, (6, 1, 9)>
<4, (9, 5, 6)>
