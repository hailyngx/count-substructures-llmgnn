Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) 

Response:
The center nodes in the 3-star graphs must have exactly three edges. We can see that the only node to satisfy this condition in the given graph is node 2. 

Now, let's find all the 3-stars in the graph with node 2 as the central node:
1. \( <2, (0, 5, 8)> \)
2. \( <2, (3, 4, 7)> \)

Therefore, there are [2] unique 3-stars in the given graph with node 2 as the central node.
