Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.  

<0, (2, 4, 8)>  
<2, (0, 4, 8)>  
<4, (0, 1, 2)>  
<9, (1, 3, 6)>
