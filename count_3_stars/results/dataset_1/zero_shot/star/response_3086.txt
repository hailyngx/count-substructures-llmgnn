Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of [2] 3-stars in the given graph.  

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<0, (1, 3, 8)>
<1, (0, 6, 7)>
