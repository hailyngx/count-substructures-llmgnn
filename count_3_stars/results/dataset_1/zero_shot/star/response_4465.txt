Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
The 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 2, 6)>
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<1, (4, 5, 6)>
<4, (1, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
