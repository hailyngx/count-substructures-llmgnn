Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) 

Response:
There are [<0, (1, 2, 3)>, <0, (4, 6, 7)>, <3, (0, 2, 5)>, <3, (7, 0, 5)>] 3-stars in the given graph. The total count is [4].
