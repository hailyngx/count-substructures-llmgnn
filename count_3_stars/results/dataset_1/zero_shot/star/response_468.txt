Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-star structures:
<1, (5, 7, 8)>
<2, (8, 9, 3)>
<3, (4, 8, 9)>
<4, (3, 5, 7)>
<5, (1, 4, 6)>
<6, (0, 5, 7)>
<7, (1, 4, 5)>
<8, (1, 2, 3)>
<9, (2, 8, 3)>

There are a total of [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
