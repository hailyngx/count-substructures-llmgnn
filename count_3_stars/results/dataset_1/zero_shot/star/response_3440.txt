Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 2) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 6, 7)>
<0, (7, 8, 3)>
<2, (5, 8, 9)>
<5, (2, 8, 0)>
