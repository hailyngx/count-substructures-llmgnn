Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The unique 3-stars in the given graph are:
<0, (2, 3, 5)>
<1, (2, 3, 6)>
<1, (2, 3, 8)>
<2, (0, 1, 4)>
<3, (0, 1, 6)>
<3, (0, 1, 8)>
<4, (2, 9, 0)>
<5, (0, 8, 2)>
<6, (1, 9, 3)>
<7, (9, 6, 0)>
<8, (1, 3, 5)>
<9, (4, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
