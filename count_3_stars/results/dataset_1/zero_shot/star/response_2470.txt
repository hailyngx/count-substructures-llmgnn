Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph. The unique 3-stars are <0, (6, 8, 1)>, <1, (3, 4, 6)>, <2, (4, 5, 7)>, and <3, (1, 5, 8)>.
