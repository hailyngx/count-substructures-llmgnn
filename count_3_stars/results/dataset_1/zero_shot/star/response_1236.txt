Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<7, (1, 2, 9)>
<2, (7, 8, 1)>
<8, (2, 7, 7)>
