Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 7, 8)>
<1, (0, 4, 5)>
<2, (9, 5, 7)>
<3, (5, 6, 9)>
<4, (1, 7, 5)>
<5, (1, 3, 9)>
