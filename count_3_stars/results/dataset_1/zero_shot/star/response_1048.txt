Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 2 3-stars in the given graph.  
The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 5, 3)>  
<2, (3, 7, 8)>  

Therefore, the final answer is [2].
