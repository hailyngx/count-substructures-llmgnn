Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph.  

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (5, 3, 4)>
<1, (7, 8, 9)>
<3, (5, 6, 7)>
<4, (5, 8, 6)>
<5, (0, 3, 4)>
<8, (1, 9, 6)>
