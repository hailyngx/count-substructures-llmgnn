Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:
- <2, (7, 8, 9)>
- <3, (5, 9, 4)>
- <4, (5, 3, 9)>
- <7, (2, 8, 9)>
- <8, (2, 7, 9)>
- <9, (3, 7, 8)>

There are a total of [6] 3-stars in the graph.
