Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be calculated by counting the number of unique paths of length 2 starting from each node. Each such path corresponds to a 3-star with the starting node as the center. 

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the given graph:
<0, (2, 3, 7)>
<2, (0, 3, 4)>
<3, (0, 2, 7)>
<4, (2, 6, 9)>
<5, (6, 7, 9)>
<6, (2, 4, 7)>
<7, (2, 6, 9)>
<8, (6, 9)>
<9, (4, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
