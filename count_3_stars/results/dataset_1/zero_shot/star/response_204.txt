Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are:
- <0, (4, 6, 8)>
- <1, (2, 6, 7)>
- <4, (0, 5, 7)>
- <7, (1, 4, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
