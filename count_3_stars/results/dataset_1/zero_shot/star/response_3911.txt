Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be found by counting the number of central nodes with exactly three connected nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

<>There are no 3-stars in this graph.<>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [0].
