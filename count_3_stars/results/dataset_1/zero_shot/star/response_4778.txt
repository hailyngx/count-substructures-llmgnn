Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:
- <0, (4, 6, 7)>
- <1, (4, 7, 0)>
- <2, (5, 6, 0)>
- <3, (4, 7, 0)>
- <4, (0, 1, 3)>
- <5, (2, 6, 0)>
- <6, (0, 4, 8)>
- <7, (0, 1, 3)>
- <8, (0, 6, 9)>
- <9, (7, 8, 0)>

Therefore, there are a total of [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
