Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
    
    <1, (4, 5, 6)>
    <3, (4, 5, 6)>
    <4, (0, 1, 2)>
    <7, (3, 4, 8)>
