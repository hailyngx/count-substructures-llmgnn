Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (7, 1, 7)>
<1, (2, 1, 5)>
<2, (1, 7, 0)>
<3, (7, 9, 4)>
<4, (9, 3, 7)>
<5, (1, 7, 1)>
<6, (1, 7, 1)>
<7, (0, 7, 2)>
<8, (7, 7, 0)>
<9, (1, 3, 4)>
