Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:
[6]  
[0, (9, 6, 0)]  
[1, (4, 1, 5)]  
[2, (8, 1, 2)]  
[5, (7, 5, 1)]  
[9, (0, 2, 9)]  

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
