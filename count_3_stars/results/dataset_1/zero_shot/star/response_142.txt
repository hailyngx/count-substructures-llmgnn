Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph.

The 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 9, 2)>
<2, (4, 6, 0)>
<4, (0, 2, 9)>
<5, (1, 8, 9)>
<9, (0, 3, 4)>
