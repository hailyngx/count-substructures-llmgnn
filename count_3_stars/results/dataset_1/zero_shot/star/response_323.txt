Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
    
    <0, (3, 9, 2)>
    <1, (2, 4, 5)>
    <2, (1, 3, 9)>
    <3, (0, 2, 8)>
    <5, (1, 4, 8)>
    <9, (0, 2, 5)>
