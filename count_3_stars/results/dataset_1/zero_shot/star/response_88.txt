Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in this graph can be found by counting the number of times a node is connected to exactly three other nodes (forming a 3-star configuration).

    The 3-stars in this graph are:
    <0, (4, 5, 9)>
    <2, (3, 4, 7)>
    <3, (2, 5, 6)>
    <4, (0, 2, 5)>
    <5, (0, 3, 4)>
    <7, (1, 2, -)>  (Only two leaves instead of three)
    <8, (2, 9, -)>  (Only two leaves instead of three)
    <9, (3, 5, 8)>

    The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
