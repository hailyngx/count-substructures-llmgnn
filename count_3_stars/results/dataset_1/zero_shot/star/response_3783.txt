Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-star subgraphs in the given graph, we need to identify the nodes that form 3-star patterns. In a 3-star pattern, the central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list the unique 3-stars below and then count them:

<0, (2, 5, 8)>
<1, (4, 7, -)>
<2, (0, 4, 7)>
<3, (6, 8, -)>
<4, (1, 2, 6)>
<5, (0, 6, 7)>
<6, (2, 3, 4)>
<7, (1, 2, 5)>
<8, (0, 3, 4)>
<9, (6, 7, -)>

Count: [10]
