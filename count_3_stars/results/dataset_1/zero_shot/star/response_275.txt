Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph. 
The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (3, 8, 9)>
<1, (7, 8, 9)>
<3, (0, 4, 8)>
<4, (3, 8, 9)>
<7, (1, 8, 9)>
<9, (0, 6, 7)>
