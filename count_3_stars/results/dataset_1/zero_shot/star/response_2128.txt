Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in this graph. Here is the list of 3-stars and the final count:

[4]

<0, (3, 4, 6)>
<1, (4, 5, 7)>
<2, (4, 5, 7)>
<4, (0, 2, 6)>
