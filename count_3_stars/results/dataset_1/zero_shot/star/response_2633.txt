Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 5) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 5), (1, 0), (1, 7), (2, 0), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 8), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 7), (5, 9), (6, 4), (7, 1), (7, 5), (7, 8), (8, 2), (8, 7), (9, 5)

To count the number of 3-stars, we first identify each unique 3-star structure in the graph:

- <0, (1, 2, 5)>
- <2, (0, 4, 5)>
- <4, (2, 3, 6)>
- <5, (0, 2, 7)>
- <7, (1, 5, 8)>

Since each 3-star can be rotated 3 times due to the center node having 3 possible connections, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5 * 3 = 15].
