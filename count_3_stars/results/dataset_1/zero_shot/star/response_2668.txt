Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (2, 7, 8)>, <2, (0, 3, 5)>.
