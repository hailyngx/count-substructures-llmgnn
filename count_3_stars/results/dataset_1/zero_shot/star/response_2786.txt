Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are as follows:
[<0, (2, 3, 6)>, <0, (3, 4, 6)>, <1, (4, 7, 8)>, <1, (7, 8, 9)>]

Therefore, there are a total of [4] 3-stars in the graph.
