Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (3, 4, 6)>
<4, (1, 2, 8)>
<6, (1, 4, 8)>
<8, (4, 6, 7)>
