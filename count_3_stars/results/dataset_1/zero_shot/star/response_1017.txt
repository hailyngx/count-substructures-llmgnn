Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The answer is [6].
The 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<1, (3, 4, 5)>
<4, (1, 7, 9)>
<5, (0, 1, 6)>
<6, (0, 5, 8)>
<9, (4, 5, )>
