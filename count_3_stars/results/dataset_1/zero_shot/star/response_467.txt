Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) 

Response:
There are [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
  
The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 5, 7)>
<0, (5, 7, 8)>
<1, (3, 4, 7)>
<2, (0, 5, 8)>
<3, (1, 4, 7)>
<4, (3, 7, 6)>
<5, (0, 2, 8)>
<7, (0, 1, 4)>
