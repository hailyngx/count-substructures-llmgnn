Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 6) 

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are:

- <2, (5, 7, 6)>
- <3, (0, 8, 6)>
- <4, (6, 7, 4)>
- <5, (2, 7, 5)>
- <6, (2, 4, 8)>
- <7, (1, 4, 5)>
- <8, (3, 6, 8)>

Therefore, there are [7] 3-stars in the graph provided.
