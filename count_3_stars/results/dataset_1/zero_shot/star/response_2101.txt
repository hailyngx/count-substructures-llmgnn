Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The central nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes are 1, 4, and 5. Let's find the 3-stars containing each of these central nodes:

For central node 1:
- Leaves: 2, 4, 5, 8, 9
- <1, (2, 4, 5)>
- <1, (2, 4, 8)>
- <1, (2, 5, 9)>
- <1, (4, 5, 9)>

For central node 4:
- Leaves: 1, 7, 8, 9
- <4, (1, 7, 9)>
- <4, (1, 8, 9)>
- <4, (7, 8, 9)>

For central node 5:
- Leaves: 0, 1, 9
- <5, (0, 1, 9)>
- <5, (0, 5, 9)>

Counting the total number of unique 3-stars, we get [10].
