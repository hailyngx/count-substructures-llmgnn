Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) 

Response:
The task is to identify 3-stars in the graph. Let's list down all the nodes and the nodes they are connected to:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 6, 7
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 5
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 5, 7
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 7, 9
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 7, 8
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 8
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, 5
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 5, 6
- Node 9 is connected to node 4

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- <0, (1, 3, 7)>
- <5, (1, 3, 7)>
- <7, (0, 3, 5)>
- <8, (5, 6, 9)>

Therefore, there are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.
