Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (4, 7, 8)>
<2, (1, 3, 8)>
<4, (1, 7, 9)>
<8, (1, 2, 6)>
<9, (4, 5, 8)>
