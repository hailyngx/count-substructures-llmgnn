Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph. 
<0, (7, 8, 9)>
<3, (2, 4, 5)>
<5, (3, 6, 9)>
<9, (0, 2, 5)>
