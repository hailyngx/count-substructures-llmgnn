Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 1) (7, 2) (8, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph: <2, (1, 4, 6)> and <2, (3, 7, 9)>. 
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
