Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are two 3-star graphs in the given graph. The unique 3-stars are:

<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<3, (5, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
