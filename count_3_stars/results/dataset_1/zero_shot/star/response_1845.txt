Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here is the list of unique 3-stars found:

<0, (2, 6, 8)>
<1, (5, 6, 7)>
<2, (0, 4, 8)>
<3, (5, 7, 9)>
<9, (1, 2, 6)>

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
