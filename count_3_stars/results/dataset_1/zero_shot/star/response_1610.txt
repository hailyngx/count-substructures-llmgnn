Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (5, 9, 3)>
<8, (1, 2, 6)>
