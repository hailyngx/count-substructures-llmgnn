Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 3-star structures in the given graph. The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<2, (3, 6, 8)>
<3, (2, 5, 7)>
<4, (7, 8, 9)>
