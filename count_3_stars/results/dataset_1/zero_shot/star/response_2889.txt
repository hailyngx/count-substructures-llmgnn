Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 4, 7)>
<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<1, (0, 3, 5)>
<3, (1, 4, 7)>
<4, (0, 3, 5)>
<7, (0, 3, 9)>
