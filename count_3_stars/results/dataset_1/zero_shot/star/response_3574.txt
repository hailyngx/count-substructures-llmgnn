Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
There are 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph.  
The 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 5, 7)>  
<9, (0, 1, 2)>  

Therefore, the final answer is: [2].
