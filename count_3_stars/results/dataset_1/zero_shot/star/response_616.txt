Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 7) (2, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph.  

The unique 3-stars are:  
<0, (6, 9, 1)>  
<1, (4, 6, 8)>  
<2, (7, 9, 0)>  
<4, (1, 6, 9)>   
<5, (7, 8, 6)>  
<7, (2, 5, 6)>
