Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 6, 7)>
<1, (2, 3, 6)>
<1, (2, 5, 9)>
<3, (1, 6, 9)>
<5, (1, 4, 8)>
<5, (2, 8, 9)>
