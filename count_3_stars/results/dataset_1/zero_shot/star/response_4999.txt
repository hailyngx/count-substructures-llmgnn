Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<0, (1, 5, 9)>
<1, (0, 4, 9)>
<4, (1, 3, 5)>
<5, (0, 4, 6)>
<6, (2, 5, 7)>
