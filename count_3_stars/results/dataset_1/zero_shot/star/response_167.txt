Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The total number of 3-star structures in this graph can be calculated by examining the number of neighbors of each node. Since a 3-star consists of a center node connected to three other nodes, we need to find nodes that have exactly three neighbors.

From the given edges, we can determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors (2, 4, 7)
- Node 1: 3 neighbors (2, 5, 7)
- Node 2: 4 neighbors (0, 1, 8, 9)
- Node 3: 3 neighbors (7, 8, 9)
- Node 4: 4 neighbors (0, 5, 7, 8)
- Node 5: 3 neighbors (1, 4, 8)
- Node 7: 4 neighbors (0, 1, 3, 4, 8)
- Node 8: 5 neighbors (2, 3, 4, 5, 7)
- Node 9: 2 neighbors (2, 3)

Therefore, we observe the following 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (2, 4, 7)>
<1, (2, 5, 7)>
<2, (0, 1, 8)>
<3, (7, 8, 9)>
<4, (0, 5, 7)>
<5, (1, 4, 8)>
<7, (0, 1, 4)>
<8, (2, 5, 7)>

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
