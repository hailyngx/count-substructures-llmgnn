Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are total 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are:

<0, (1, 8, 9)>
<1, (0, 5, 8)>
<2, (3, 5, -)>
<3, (0, 2, 4)>
<4, (3, 5, -)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
