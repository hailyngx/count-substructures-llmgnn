Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 9) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be calculated by examining each node to see if it forms the center of a 3-star. 

Looking at the node degrees:
- Node 0: degree = 3
- Node 1: degree = 1
- Node 2: degree = 1
- Node 3: degree = 3
- Node 4: degree = 4
- Node 5: degree = 1
- Node 6: degree = 1
- Node 8: degree = 2
- Node 9: degree = 5

Thus, the nodes that could potentially be the center of a 3-star are: 0, 3, 4, and 9.

Analyzing further:
- Node 0: <0, (1, 3, 4)>
- Node 3: <3, (0, 4, 5)>
- Node 4: <4, (0, 3, 8)>
- Node 9: <9, (2, 6, 8)>, <9, (4, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4]. 
The unique 3-stars identified are: <0, (1, 3, 4)>, <3, (0, 4, 5)>, <4, (0, 3, 8)>, <9, (2, 6, 8)>.
