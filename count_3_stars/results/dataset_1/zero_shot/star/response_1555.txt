Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

The 3-stars are:
<1, (2, 5, 6)>
<3, (4, 6, 7)>
<4, (0, 3, 6)>
<6, (1, 4, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
