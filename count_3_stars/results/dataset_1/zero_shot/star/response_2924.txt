Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 6) (4, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are listed below:

1. <0, (9, 5, 8)>
2. <1, (4, 6, 9)>
3. <2, (5, 6, 9)>
4. <6, (1, 2, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
