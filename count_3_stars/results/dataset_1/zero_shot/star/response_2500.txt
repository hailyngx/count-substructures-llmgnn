Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The 3-stars are:

<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<7, (0, 3, 4)>
<3, (7, 9, 0)>
<5, (1, 6, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
