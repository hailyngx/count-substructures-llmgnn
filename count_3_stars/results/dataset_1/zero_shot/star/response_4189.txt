Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in this graph is [3].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (2, 3, 6)>
<2, (0, 3, 9)>
<7, (1, 5, 9)>
