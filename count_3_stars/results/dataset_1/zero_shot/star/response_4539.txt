Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 6, 8)>
<1, (4, 7, 9)>
<2, (0, 4, 6)>
<3, (5, 6, -)>
<4, (1, 2, 5)>
<5, (3, 4, 7)>
<6, (0, 2, 3)>
