Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
There are a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph. Here are the unique 3-stars:
<2, (3, 5, 7)>
<3, (2, 5, 8)>
<5, (1, 2, 3)>
<7, (0, 2, 5)>
<8, (3, 6, 9)>
<9, (1, 2, 8)>
