Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph as follows:
    
    1. <0, (1, 2, 7)>
    2. <1, (0, 4, 9)>
    3. <2, (0, 3, 8)>
    4. <3, (2, 6, 8)>
    5. <4, (1, 7, 8)>
