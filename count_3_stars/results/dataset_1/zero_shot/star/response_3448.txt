Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

The 3-stars are:
<0, (8, 9), (1)> 
<2, (1, 7), (5)> 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
