Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph: <0, (2, 4, 7)>, <1, (4, 5, 6)>, <2, (0, 4, 6)>, <3, (0, 4, 5)>, <4, (0, 1, 7)>, and <7, (0, 1, 4)>.
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
