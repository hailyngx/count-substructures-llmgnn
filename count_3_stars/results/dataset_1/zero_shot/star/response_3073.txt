Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 different 3-stars in this graph. The 3-stars are as follows:
<0, (1, 6, 8)>
<1, (0, 2, 9)>
<3, (4, 5, 6)>
<9, (1, 4, 8)>
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
