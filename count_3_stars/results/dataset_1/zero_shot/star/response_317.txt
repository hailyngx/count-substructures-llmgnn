Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be determined by examining which nodes can act as the central node and identify the adjacent nodes for each potential 3-star. By analyzing the connectivity of the nodes in the graph, we can list all the unique 3-stars present.

Given the provided edges, the possible 3-stars in the graph are as follows:
<0, (1, 7, 8)>
<1, (0, 5, 6)>
<3, (4, 5, 8)>
<4, (3, 5, 7)>
<5, (1, 2, 3)>
<6, (1, 3, 8)>
<7, (0, 4, 8)>
<8, (0, 3, 6)>
<9, (3, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
