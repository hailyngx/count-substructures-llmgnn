Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 8) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are several 3-stars in the given graph. Let's list them below and count them to find the total number of 3-stars.

<0, (4, 5, 8)>
<4, (0, 2, 3)>
<5, (0, 8, -)>
<8, (0, 5, -)>
<9, (1, 4, -)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
