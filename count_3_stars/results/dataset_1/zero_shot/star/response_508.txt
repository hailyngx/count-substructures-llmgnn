Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 44 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4]. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 5, 7)>
<1, (4, 5, 9)>
<3, (0, 2, 8)>
<6, (4, 7, 9)>
