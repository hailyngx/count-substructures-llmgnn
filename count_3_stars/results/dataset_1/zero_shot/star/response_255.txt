Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph.
The 3-stars are:
<0, (5, 7, 1)>
<2, (4, 6, 7)>
<3, (5, 6, 8)>
<9, (6, 3, 7)>
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
