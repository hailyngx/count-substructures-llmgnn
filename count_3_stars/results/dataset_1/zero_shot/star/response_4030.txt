Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 8) (2, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) 

Response:
There are 3 unique 3-stars in this graph. The 3-stars are:

<0, (5, 6, 7)>
<5, (0, 2, 4)>
<7, (3, 5, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
