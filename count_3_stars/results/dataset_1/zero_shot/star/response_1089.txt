Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 7, 8)>
<0, (6, 7, 8)>
<0, (7, 3, 9)>
<0, (8, 2, 9)>
