Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:
[<0, (1, 9, 4)>, <1, (0, 6, 9)>, <3, (4, 5, 8)>]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
