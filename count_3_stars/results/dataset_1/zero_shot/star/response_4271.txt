Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are <0, (6, 6, 9)>, <1, (4, 4, 8)>, <2, (3, 5, 6)>, <2, (3, 6, 8)>, <3, (4, 6, 7)>, <6, (0, 2, 9)>.
