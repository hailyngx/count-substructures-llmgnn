Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are:

[<0, (3, 5, 7)>]

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [1].
