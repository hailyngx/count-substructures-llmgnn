Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 3 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The count is [3].
   
   <0, (3, 4, 6)>
   <2, (1, 6, 8)>
   <6, (1, 2, 4)>
