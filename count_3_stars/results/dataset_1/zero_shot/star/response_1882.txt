Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 4. Here they are listed below inside square brackets:

[4]

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (2, 8, 9)>
<1, (6, 7, 9)>
<2, (0, 8, 9)>
<3, (4, 9, 6)>
