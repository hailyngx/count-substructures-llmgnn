Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 9) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
[<0, (1, 8, 8)>, <1, (0, 8, 3)>, <3, (1, 9, 9)>, <4, (7, 9, 7)>, <7, (2, 8, 4)>]
