Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
There are [5] 3-stars in the given graph.  

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (0, 2, 4)>
<1, (2, 4, 9)>
<3, (7, 8, 5)>
<5, (6, 7, 5)>
<9, (1, 2, 1)>
