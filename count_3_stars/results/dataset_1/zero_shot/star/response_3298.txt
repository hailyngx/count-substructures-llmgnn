Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 10 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 7) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to node 4.
- Node 1 is connected to node 8.
- Node 2 is connected to node 7.
- Node 3 is connected to node 6.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0 and 7.
- Node 6 is connected to node 3.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2 and 4.
- Node 8 is connected to node 1.

Now let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:

There are three possible scenarios for a 3-star:
1. Central node is connected to three leaves.
2. Central node has one common neighbor with two other leaves.
3. Two adjacent nodes are leaves of the central node.

Calculating the number of 3-stars based on the above scenarios:

1. There are no instances where the center node is connected to three leaves.
2. There are no instances where the center node has one common neighbor with two other leaves.
3. The 3-stars in the given graph are: <4, (0, 7, 7)> and <7, (2, 4, 4)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
