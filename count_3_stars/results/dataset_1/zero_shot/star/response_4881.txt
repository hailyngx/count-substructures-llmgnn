Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
There are a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (2, 8, 9)>
<2, (1, 3, 6)>
<3, (1, 2, 6)>
<4, (6, 7, 5)>
<6, (2, 3, 4)>
