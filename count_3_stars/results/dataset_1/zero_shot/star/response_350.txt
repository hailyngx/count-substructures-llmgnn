Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The central nodes in a 3-star must have exactly 3 edges. After checking the graph, we find that the nodes 0, 1, 6, 8, and 9 satisfy this condition. For each of these nodes, we check if they are connected to exactly three unique nodes to form a 3-star.

Here are the unique 3-stars in this graph:
<0, (4, 9)>
<1, (6, 8)>
<6, (1, 7, 8)>
<8, (1, 6)>
<9, (0, 3, 7)>
