Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) 

Response:
There are [9] 3-stars in the given graph. 

<0, (6, 7, 8)>
<2, (5, 8, 9)>
<4, (5, 8, 0)>
<5, (2, 8, 3)>
<6, (0, 7, 0)>
<7, (0, 0, 8)>
<8, (0, 4, 5)>
<9, (2, 2, 8)>
<5, (3, 4, 8)>
