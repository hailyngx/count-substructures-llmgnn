Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars found are <0, (2, 5, 7)>, <3, (0, 5, 8)>, <5, (0, 3, 7)>, <7, (0, 2, 5)>, <2, (0, 7, 8)>, and <8, (3, 7, 2)>.
