Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-star structures:

[6]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1].
