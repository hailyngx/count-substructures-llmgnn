Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

The 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 7, 9)>
<1, (3, 5, 6)>
<2, (8, 3, 0)>
<3, (0, 1, 8)>
<6, (1, 5, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
