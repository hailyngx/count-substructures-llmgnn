Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are three 3-star graphs in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<3, (0, 1, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
