Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 different 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are:

<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<1, (0, 5, 8)>
<3, (4, 5, 0)>
<6, (0, 4, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
