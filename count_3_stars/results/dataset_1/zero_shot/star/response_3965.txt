Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 3 different 3-stars in the given graph. Here is the list of unique 3-stars found:

<2, (0, 5, 6)>
<6, (2, 5, 8)>
<7, (4, 9, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
