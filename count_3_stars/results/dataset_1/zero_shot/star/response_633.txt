Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (5, 1, 6)>
<1, (7, 5, 6)>
<2, (4, 3, 9)>
<3, (2, 4, 9)>
<4, (2, 3, 8)>
<5, (0, 1, 6)>
<6, (1, 5, 8)>
