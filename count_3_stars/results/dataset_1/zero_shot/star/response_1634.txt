Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<1, (0, 5, 7)>
<5, (0, 6, 9)>
<5, (1, 6, 9)>
