Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 7, 9)>
<1, (0, 3, 8)>
