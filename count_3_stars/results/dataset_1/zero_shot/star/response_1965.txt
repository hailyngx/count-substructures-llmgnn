Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 2 unique 3-stars in this graph. The 3-stars are as follows:
<1, (7, 8, 9)>
<9, (1, 5, 8)>
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
