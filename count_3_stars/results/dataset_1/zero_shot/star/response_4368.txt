Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in this graph can be calculated by looking at the nodes connected to each node.

Observing the given edges, we can see that there are multiple 3-stars present in the graph. Let's identify them:

1. <0, (3, 5, 7)>
2. <1, (3, 5, 7)>
3. <6, (1, 4, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
