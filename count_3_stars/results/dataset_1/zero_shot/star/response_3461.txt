Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are [<1, (2, 8, 3)>, <3, (4, 6, 5)>, <4, (7, 3, 6)>] 3-stars in the given graph.
