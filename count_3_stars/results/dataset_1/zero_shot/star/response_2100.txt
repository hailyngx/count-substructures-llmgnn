Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars: 
<0, (1, 6, 9)>
<3, (4, 5, 9)>
<4, (2, 3, 7)>
<5, (3, 4, 7)>
