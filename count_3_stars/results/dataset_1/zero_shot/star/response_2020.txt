Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be counted by looking at each node and checking how many 3-stars are centered on it. Considering that the graph has 10 nodes, we can list the unique 3-stars as follows:
    
    <1, (4, 6, 7)>
    <2, (4, 1, 3)>
    <3, (4, 2, 9)>
    <5, (7, 8, 1)>
    
Counting these unique 3-stars, we have a total of [4] 3-stars in the given graph.
