Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (6, 8, 0)>
<1, (2, 7, 1)>
<3, (4, 8, 3)>
<5, (6, 7, 9)>
