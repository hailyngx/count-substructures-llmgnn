Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated by finding all possible combinations of nodes where the center node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the given graph:
1. Node 0 forms 3-stars with nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9.
2. Node 2 forms 3-stars with nodes 3, 7, and 9.
3. Node 3 forms 3-stars with nodes 2, 5, and 6.
4. Node 5 forms 3-stars with nodes 1, 3, 6, 8, and 9.
5. Node 6 forms 3-stars with nodes 0, 3, 5, and 8.
6. Node 8 forms 3-stars with nodes 0, 5, 6, 7, and 9.
7. Node 9 forms 3-stars with nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, and 8.

Combining all these, the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (6, 7, 8)>
<0, (6, 7, 9)>
<0, (6, 8, 9)>
<0, (7, 8, 9)>
<2, (3, 7, 9)>
<3, (2, 5, 6)>
<5, (1, 3, 6)>
<5, (1, 6, 8)>
<5, (3, 6, 8)>
<5, (6, 8, 9)>
<6, (0, 3, 5)>
<6, (0, 3, 8)>
<6, (0, 5, 8)>
<6, (3, 5, 8)>
<8, (0, 5, 6)>
<8, (0, 6, 7)>
<8, (0, 6, 9)>
<8, (5, 6, 7)>
<8, (5, 6, 9)>
<8, (6, 7, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 2)>
<9, (0, 1, 4)>
<9, (0, 1, 5)>
<9, (0, 2, 4)>
<9, (0, 2, 5)>
<9, (0, 4, 5)>
<9, (1, 2, 4)>
<9, (1, 2, 5)>
<9, (1, 4, 5)>
<9, (2, 4, 5)>
