Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of three-stars in the given graph is [6].

The unique three-stars are:
<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<1, (0, 2, 9)>
<1, (3, 7, 8)>
<1, (8, 5, 6)>
<8, (1, 6, 9)>
<9, (0, 2, 4)>
