Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:
- 2, (0, 3, 7)
- 3, (1, 7, 8)
- 4, (6, 7, 9)
- 7, (3, 4, 9)
- 8, (3, 9, 1)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
