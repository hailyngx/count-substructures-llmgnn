Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are three 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<2, (3, 4, 5)>
<3, (2, 6, 8)>
<4, (2, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [3].
