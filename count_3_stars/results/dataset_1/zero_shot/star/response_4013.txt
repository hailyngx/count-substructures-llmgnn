Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

The 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 3, 8)>
<7, (1, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the final answer is [2].
