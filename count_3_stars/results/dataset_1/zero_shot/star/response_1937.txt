Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<2, (1, 4, 6)>
<6, (0, 4, 8)>
