Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The graph described has the following 3-stars:
[<0, (1, 8, 9)>, <1, (0, 3, 5)>, <2, (5, 9, -)>, <3, (1, 4, 6)>, <4, (3, 9, -)>, <5, (1, 2, 7)>, <6, (3, 9, -)>, <7, (3, 5, -)>, <8, (0, 3, -)>, <9, (1, 2, 4)>]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
