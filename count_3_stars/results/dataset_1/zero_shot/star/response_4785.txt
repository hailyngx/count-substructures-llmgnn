Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

```
0 -- 2 -- 6
|    |  
|    |_ 7 -- 8  
|    |  |
3    5  4
      |  
      |_ 9
```

To count the number of 3-star subgraphs, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list the unique 3-stars found:

<0, (2, 5, 9)>
<2, (0, 5, 9)>
<5, (0, 2, 9)>
<9, (0, 2, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
