Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The counts of each 3-star are as follows:
- <0, (5, 6, 1)>: 1
- <2, (4, 7, 8)>: 1
- <3, (7, 8, 4)>: 1
- <5, (1, 9, 0)>: 1

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
