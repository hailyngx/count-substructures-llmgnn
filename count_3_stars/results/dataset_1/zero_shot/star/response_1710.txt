Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The answer is [6].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (2, 4, 7)>
<1, (4, 7, 9)>
<2, (1, 9, 6)>
<3, (7, 8, empty)>
<7, (1, 4, 5)>
<7, (3, 4, 8)>
