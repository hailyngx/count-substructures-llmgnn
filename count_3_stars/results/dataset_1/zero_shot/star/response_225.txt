Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [3] unique 3-stars in the given graph:
<5, (4, 7, 9)>
<7, (0, 5, 8)>
<8, (1, 2, 7)>
