Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here are the unique 3-stars with their respective central node and leaf nodes:

<1, (3, 5, 7)>
<2, (0, 6, 1)>
<5, (1, 6, 9)>
<6, (1, 5, 2)>
<7, (1, 5, 8)>
<8, (3, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
