Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 3-star structures in a graph with a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars present in the given graph:

1. <0, (1, 2, 3)>
2. <1, (0, 2, 3)>
3. <2, (0, 1, 3)>
4. <3, (0, 1, 2)>
5. <4, (3, 7, 9)>
6. <5, (7)>
7. <6, (1, 2, 3)>
8. <7, (4, 5, 9)>
9. <8, (2, 3, 9)>
10. <9, (2, 4, 7)>

Therefore, there are 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The final answer is [10].
