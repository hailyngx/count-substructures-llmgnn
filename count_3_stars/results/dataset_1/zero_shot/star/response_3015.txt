Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are <0, (3, 4, 5)>, <1, (2, 6, 9)>, and <4, (2, 3, 5)>.
   
    Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
