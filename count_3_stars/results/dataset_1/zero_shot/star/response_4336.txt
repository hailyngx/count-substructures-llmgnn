Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 1) 

Response:
There are 2 unique 3-stars in this graph. 
The 3-stars are:
<1, (4, 9, 0)>
<2, (4, 6, 8)>
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
