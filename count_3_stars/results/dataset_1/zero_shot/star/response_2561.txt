Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented in matrix form as follows:

|   | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 |
| 2 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 3 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 |
| 4 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 5 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 6 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 |
| 7 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
| 8 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 9 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 |

We can see that there are four 3-stars in this graph. The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 4, 8)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<3, (0, 1, 8)>
<4, (0, 1, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
