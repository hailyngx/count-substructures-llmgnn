Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph. The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<4, (0, 6, 8)>
<5, (0, 6, 8)>
<8, (1, 4, 7)>
