Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The center nodes in a 3-star must have degree 3. Let's identify the nodes with degree 3 in the graph:

- Node 0 has degree 3 (connected to nodes 1, 2, and 5).
- Node 1 has degree 4, not 3.
- Node 2 has degree 5, not 3.
- Node 3 has degree 3 (connected to nodes 1, 8, and 9).
- Node 4 has degree 4, not 3.
- Node 5 has degree 4, not 3.
- Node 6 has degree 2, not 3.
- Node 7 has degree 4, not 3.
- Node 8 has degree 5, not 3.
- Node 9 has degree 6, not 3.

Therefore, the 3-stars in the given graph are <0, (1, 2, 5)> and <3, (1, 8, 9)>.

So the final answer is [2].
