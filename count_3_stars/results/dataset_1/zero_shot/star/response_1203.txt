Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

The 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<2, (4, 7, 7)>
<4, (2, 5, 6)>
<7, (1, 2, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
