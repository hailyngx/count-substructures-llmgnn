Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be found by identifying the possible combinations of center nodes and leaf nodes.

The center node candidates are: 0, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9.

Let's find the valid 3-stars based on each center node:
- Center node 0: No valid 3-star
- Center node 2: <2, (0, 8, 9)> and <2, (4, 6, 7)>
- Center node 4: No valid 3-star
- Center node 6: No valid 3-star
- Center node 7: No valid 3-star
- Center node 8: No valid 3-star
- Center node 9: No valid 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2]. The unique 3-stars found are: <<2, (0, 8, 9)>, <2, (4, 6, 7)>>
