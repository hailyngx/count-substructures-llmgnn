Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 2) 

Response:
The given graph has 3-star structures consisting of a center node connected to three other nodes. Let's find all the unique 3-stars in this graph:

<0, (1, 6, 1)>
<1, (0, 6, 8)>
<2, (1, 3, 4)>
<3, (1, 5, 6)>
<4, (2, 2, 9)>
<5, (3, 8, 3)>
<6, (0, 1, 3)>
<8, (1, 5, 1)>
<9, (2, 2, 4)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
