Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of 3-star configurations in the given graph can be determined by identifying the central node (center) and the three leaves connected to it.

Upon analyzing the given edges provided in the graph, we can identify the following unique 3-star configurations:
1. <0, (2, 4, 1)>
2. <2, (0, 8, 3)>
3. <3, (2, 6, 9)>
4. <4, (0, 1, 5)>
5. <6, (3, 7)>
6. <8, (2, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-star configurations in the given graph is [6].
