Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:
- <2, (4, 8, 9)>
- <5, (1, 3, 6)>
- <8, (2, 5, 9)>
- <9, (0, 1, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
