Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph contains the following 3-stars:
    <0, (2, 3, 5)>
    <1, (3, 5, 8)>
    <2, (0, 5, 8)>
    <3, (0, 1, 5)>
    <4, (2, 7, 9)>
    <5, (1, 2, 8)>
    <7, (3, 8, 9)>
    <9, (4, 7, 8)>
    
    Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [8].
