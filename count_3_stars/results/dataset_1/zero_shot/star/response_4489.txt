Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There is only one 3-star in the given graph. 
The 3-star is: <0, (1, 2, 3)>
Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [1].
