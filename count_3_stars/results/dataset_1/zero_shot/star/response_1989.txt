Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are three 3-stars in the given graph.  

These 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<1, (2, 3, 8)>
<8, (1, 2, 5)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
