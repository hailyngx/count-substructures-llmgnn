Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 3) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [2] 3-stars in the given graph. The unique 3-stars are <0, (1, 7, 8)> and <4, (5, 6, 8)>.
