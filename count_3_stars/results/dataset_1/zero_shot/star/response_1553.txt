Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 3 3-stars in the given graph. 
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<0, (4, 8, 9)>
<1, (6, 7, 8)>
<7, (1, 3, 9)>
Therefore, the final answer is [3].
