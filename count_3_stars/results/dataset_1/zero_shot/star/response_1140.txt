Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph. 
The unique 3-stars are:
<2, (3, 4, 8)>
<3, (2, 8, 9)>
<4, (2, 6, 8)>
<6, (1, 4, 9)>
<7, (0, 1, 9)>
<8, (2, 3, 4)>
