Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in this graph can be calculated by counting the number of occurrences of each node as the center of the 3-star. Since each 3-star consists of a center node connected to three other nodes, we can simply check the degree of each node to determine the number of 3-stars connected to it.

Given the graph with 10 nodes and 42 edges, here's the breakdown of the 3-stars:

- Node 0 is the center of 1 3-star: <0, (1, 2, 6)>
- Node 1 is the center of 4 3-stars: <1, (0, 2, 6)>, <1, (2, 3, 8)>, <1, (3, 6, 9)>, <1, (8, 9, 0)>
- Node 2 is the center of 4 3-stars: <2, (0, 1, 6)>, <2, (1, 5, 7)>, <2, (5, 6, 9)>, <2, (7, 0, 1)>
- Node 3 is the center of 3 3-stars: <3, (1, 4, 5)>, <3, (4, 7, 1)>, <3, (7, 5, 8)>
- Node 4 is the center of 3 3-stars: <4, (3, 5, 7)>, <4, (5, 7, 6)>, <4, (7, 6, 8)>
- Node 5 is the center of 3 3-stars: <5, (2, 3, 4)>, <5, (3, 4, 7)>, <5, (4, 7, 2)>
- Node 6 is the center of 3 3-stars: <6, (0, 1, 2)>, <6, (1, 2, 7)>, <6, (2, 7, 8)>
- Node 7 is the center of 4 3-stars: <7, (2, 3, 4)>, <7, (3, 4, 6)>, <7, (4, 6, 8)>, <7, (6, 8, 2)>
- Node 8 is the center of 3 3-stars: <8, (1, 4, 9)>, <8, (4, 6, 7)>, <8, (6, 7, 1)>
- Node 9 is the center of 2 3-stars: <9, (1, 2, 0)>, <9, (2, 1, 6)>

Counting the 3-stars with their respective center nodes, we find a total of [23] 3-stars in the graph.
