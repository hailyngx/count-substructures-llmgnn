Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 6, 8)>
<1, (6, 8, 9)>
<3, (6, 8, 9)>
<5, (4, 7, 9)>
