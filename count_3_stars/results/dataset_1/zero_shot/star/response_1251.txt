Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars: 
[<1, (5, 6, 9)>, <2, (4, 5, 6)>]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
