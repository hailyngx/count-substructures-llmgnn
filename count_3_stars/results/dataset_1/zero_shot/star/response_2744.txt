Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 1) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) 

Response:
There are 3 unique 3-star structures in the given graph. Here they are:

<0, (3, 6, 9)>
<1, (3, 4, 5)>
<2, (3, 7, 1)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
