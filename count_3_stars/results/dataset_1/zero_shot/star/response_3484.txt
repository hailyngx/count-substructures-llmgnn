Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 6, 7)>
<1, (3, 4, 9)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<5, (4, 6, 7)>
