Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be calculated by counting the number of 3-stars based on each node as the center.

By inspecting the graph, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (1, 2, 9)>
<1, (0, 2, 5)>
<2, (0, 1, 6)>
<3, (5, 6, 9)>
<4, (6, 9, 10)>
<5, (1, 2, 3)>
<6, (2, 3, 4)>
<7, (1, 8, 9)>
<8, (1, 3, 9)>
<9, (0, 2, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
