Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 2, 7)>
<1, (0, 7, 8)>
<3, (4, 7, 8)>
<4, (3, 6, 7)>
