Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 7, 9)>
<0, (2, 6, 9)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<2, (0, 5, 8)>
<3, (1, 7, 8)>
<5, (2, 7, 3)>
<6, (0, 9, 2)>
<9, (0, 6, 8)>
