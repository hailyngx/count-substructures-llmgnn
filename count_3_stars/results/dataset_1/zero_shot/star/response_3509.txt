Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:
- <1, (0, 4, 9)>
- <2, (1, 4, 6)>
- <3, (2, 5, 8)>
- <4, (1, 2, 6)>
- <6, (2, 4, 8)>
- <8, (3, 6, 9)>
- <9, (1, 8, 0)>

Therefore, there are a total of [7] 3-stars in the graph.
