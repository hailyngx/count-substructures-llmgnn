Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.

<0, (1, 4, 7)>
<1, (0, 3, 6)>
<3, (1, 4, 8)>
<5, (3, 9, -)>
