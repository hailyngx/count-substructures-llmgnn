Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in this graph. The 3-stars are represented as follows:

<4, (3, 6, 8)>
<6, (4, 9, 9)>
<7, (3, 3, 8)>
<8, (4, 4, 9)>

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
