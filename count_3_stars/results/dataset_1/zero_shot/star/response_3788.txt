Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are four 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are:

<1, (5, 6, 8)>
<2, (4, 8, 3)>
<4, (2, 8, 1)>
<6, (5, 9, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
