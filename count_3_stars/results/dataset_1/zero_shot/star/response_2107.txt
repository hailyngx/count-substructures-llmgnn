Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

```
0 -- 4
|    |
1 -- 2 -- 5 -- 7
    |
    3
    |
    6
```

The 3-stars in this graph are:
[<2, (1, 5, 7)>, <4, (0, 1, 3)>, <7, (2, 5, 7)>]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
