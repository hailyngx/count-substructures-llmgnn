Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here are the 3-stars found:

<0, (1, 7, 8)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<2, (3, 5, 6)>
<8, (0, 1, 9)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
