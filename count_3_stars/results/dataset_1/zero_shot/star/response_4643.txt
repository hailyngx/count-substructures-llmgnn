Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [7] 3-stars in the given graph.

<0, (3, 5, 9)>
<1, (4, 8, 6)>
<2, (4, 1, 6)>
<3, (0, 9, 4)>
<4, (1, 2, 6)>
<6, (4, 8, 1)>
<9, (3, 4, 7)>
