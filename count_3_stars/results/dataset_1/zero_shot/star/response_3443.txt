Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 3 3-star graphs in the given graph. Therefore, the final answer is [3].
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (0, 2, 4)>
<1, (2, 4, 7)>
<4, (3, 6, 5)>
