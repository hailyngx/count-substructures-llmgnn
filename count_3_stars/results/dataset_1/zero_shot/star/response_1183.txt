Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in this graph.    
The 3-stars are:
    <0, (3, 6, 1)>
    <2, (6, 8, 9)>
    <1, (3, 9, 0)>
    <9, (1, 2, 5)>
    <8, (6, 7, 2)>
    <5, (3, 9, 6)>
    
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
