Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 2 3-stars in this graph. 
The unique 3-stars are <0, (4, 8, 3)> and <1, (9, 7, 3)>. 
Therefore, the final answer is [2].
