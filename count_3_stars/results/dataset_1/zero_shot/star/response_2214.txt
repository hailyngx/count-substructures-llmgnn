Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are a total of [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
    
<0, (1, 8, 9)>

<2, (3, 6, 9)>
<3, (2, 9, 7)>
<4, (7, 8, 9)>
<5, (6, 8, 9)>
<6, (2, 5, 9)>
<7, (2, 4, 9)>
