Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated by finding all the nodes that have 3 edges connected to them, and the count of unique 3-stars can be determined based on these nodes.

Nodes that have 3 edges connected to them are: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8.

So, the unique 3-stars in this graph are as follows:
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<2, (1, 4, 6)>
<4, (0, 2, 3)>
<6, (2, 7, 9)>
<8, (0, 7, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
