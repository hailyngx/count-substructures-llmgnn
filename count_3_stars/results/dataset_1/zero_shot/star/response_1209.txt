Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The 3-star graphs present in the given graph are:
<0, (4, 7, 8)>
<2, (5, 7, 9)>
<5, (2, 6, 9)>
<8, (3, 4, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
