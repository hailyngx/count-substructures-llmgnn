Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 46 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 3-stars in the given graph. The unique 3-stars are:
    <0, (3, 5, 6)>
    <2, (4, 6, 7)>
    <3, (0, 5, 7)>
    <4, (2, 5, 9)>
    <5, (0, 3, 9)>
    <6, (0, 2, 7)>
    <7, (0, 3, 9)>
    <9, (1, 2, 4)>
    
Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
