Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 3 unique 3-stars in this graph.  

The 3-stars are:
1. <0, (4, 5, 6)>
2. <4, (0, 7, 8)>
3. <7, (1, 4, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
