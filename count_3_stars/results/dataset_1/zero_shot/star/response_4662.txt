Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

The 3-star configurations are:
<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<1, (0, 7, 8)>
<4, (2, 5, 7)>
<7, (1, 4, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
