Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 2) 

Response:
There are 2 unique 3-stars in this graph. 

The 3-stars are:
<2, (0, 1, 5)>
<3, (2, 4, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
