Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The center of a 3-star must have degree 3, while the leaves must have degree 1. Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph based on these criteria.

The nodes with their degrees are:
- Node 0: degree 2
- Node 1: degree 3
- Node 2: degree 2
- Node 3: degree 3
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 2
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 3
- Node 8: degree 3
- Node 9: degree 4

The 3-stars in this graph are:
1. <1, (0, 8, 7)>
2. <3, (4, 7, 9)>
3. <7, (1, 3, 6)>
4. <8, (0, 2, 6)>
5. <9, (2, 3, 5)>

Therefore, there are a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
