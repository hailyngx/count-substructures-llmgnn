Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph is as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 9
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2 and 6
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 5
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 6, 7, and 9
- Node 4 is connected to node 9
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0 and 2
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1 and 3
- Node 7 is connected to node 3
- Node 8 is connected to node 9
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, and 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

- <0, (3, 5, 9)>
- <2, (1, 3, 5)>
- <3, (0, 2, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
