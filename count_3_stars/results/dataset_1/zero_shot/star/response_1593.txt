Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 7) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (0, 4, 5)>
<1, (4, 5, 9)>
<5, (1, 8, 9)>
<9, (1, 4, 5)>
<4, (1, 5, 9)>
<8, (5, 7, 9)>
