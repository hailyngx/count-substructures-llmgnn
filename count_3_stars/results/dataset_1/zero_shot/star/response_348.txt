Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph can be counted by identifying the central node and its connected edges. 
From the given list of edges, we can identify the 3-stars as follows:
- <0, (4, 8, 2)>
- <2, (3, 4, 7)>
- <4, (0, 2, 6)>
- <6, (4, 8, 9)>
- <8, (0, 4, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [5].
