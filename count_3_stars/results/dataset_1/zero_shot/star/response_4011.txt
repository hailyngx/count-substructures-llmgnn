Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are:

1. <0, (1, 5, 6)>
2. <1, (0, 3, 4)>
3. <3, (1, 4, 6)>
4. <4, (1, 3, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
