Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph with 10 nodes and 32 edges. Here are the 3-stars found:

1. <0, (1, 6, 9)>
2. <3, (2, 4, 6)>
3. <5, (2, 3, 9)>
4. <9, (0, 4, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
