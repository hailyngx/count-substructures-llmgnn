Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The 3-stars are as follows:
<0, (3, 5, 7)>
<1, (4, 7, 9)>
<2, (6, 7, 8)>
<9, (1, 4, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
