Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 3-stars in the given graph. The count is [6].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (5, 6, 9)>
<1, (3, 4, 7)>
<3, (1, 4, 5)>
<5, (0, 3, 6)>
<6, (0, 5, 9)>
<7, (1, 5, 8)>
