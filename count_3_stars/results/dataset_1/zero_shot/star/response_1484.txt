Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is 2.  

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (2, 4, 7)>
<1, (3, 8, 9)> 

Therefore, the final answer is [2].
