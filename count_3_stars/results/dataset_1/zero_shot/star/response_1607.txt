Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 7) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<0, (2, 4, 9)>
<2, (0, 3, 5)>
<3, (2, 4, 8)>
<4, (0, 3, 5)>
<5, (2, 4, 7)>
<7, (5, 8, 7)>
<8, (1, 3, 7)>
