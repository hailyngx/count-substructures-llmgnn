Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 1, 3)>
<1, (2, 0, 6)>
<2, (0, 1, 4)>
<3, (1, 0, 6)>
<4, (2, 7, 9)>
<9, (4, 8, 5)>
