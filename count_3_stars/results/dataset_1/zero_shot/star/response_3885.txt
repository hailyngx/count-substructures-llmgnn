Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph. Here are the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<0, (6, 8, 0)>
<1, (0, 4, 5)>
<2, (0, 3, 7)>
<3, (0, 2, 7)>
<4, (1, 5, 6)>
<5, (1, 4, 6)>
<6, (0, 4, 5)>
