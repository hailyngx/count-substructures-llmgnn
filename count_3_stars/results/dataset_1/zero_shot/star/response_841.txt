Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be calculated by identifying all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's calculate:
1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 5, 9.
3. Node 2 is connected to node 0.
4. Node 3 is connected to node 0.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 6, 7, 8.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 6.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 5, 9.
8. Node 7 is connected to node 4.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 4.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 6.

Now, let's list all the 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (2, 3, 5)>
<0, (2, 3, 6)>
<0, (2, 5, 6)>
<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<0, (5, 6, 8)>
<0, (5, 6, 9)>
<4, (6, 7, 8)>
<5, (0, 1, 6)>
<6, (0, 4, 5)>
<6, (0, 5, 9)>
<8, (0, 4, 8)>
<9, (0, 1, 6)>

Therefore, there are a total of [11] 3-stars in the given graph.
