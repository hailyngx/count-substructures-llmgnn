Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph. The unique 3-stars found are:

<0, (1, 8, 8)>
<1, (0, 2, 8)>
<2, (1, 6, 7)>
<6, (2, 5, 9)>
<5, (3, 6, 6)>
<9, (4, 6, 9)>
