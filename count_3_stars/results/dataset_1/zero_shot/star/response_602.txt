Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here is the list of unique 3-stars:

<0, (3, 2, 6)>
<1, (5, 7, 8)>
<2, (3, 6, 8)>
<4, (3, 6, 9)>
<5, (1, 9, 6)>

Therefore, there are a total of [5] 3-stars in the graph.
