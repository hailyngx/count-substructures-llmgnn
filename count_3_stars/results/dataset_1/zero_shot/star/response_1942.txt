Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) 

Response:
There are a total of [5] 3-stars in this graph.  

The unique 3-stars are:  
<2, (0, 1, 7)>  
<7, (1, 4, 6)>  
<6, (4, 7, 8)>  
<1, (2, 4, 7)>  
<8, (3, 5, 6)>
