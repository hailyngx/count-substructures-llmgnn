Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 8) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are two 3-stars in the given graph. The unique 3-stars are mentioned below:

<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<2, (5, 8, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
