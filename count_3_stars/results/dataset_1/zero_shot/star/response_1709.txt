Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 4) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph: 
<1, (4, 7, 8)>
<2, (3, 9, 0)>
<8, (1, 4, 5)>
