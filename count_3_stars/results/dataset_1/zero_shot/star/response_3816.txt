Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 9, 9)>
<1, (0, 3, 6)>
<2, (4, 5, 9)>
<3, (1, 8, 0)>
<4, (2, 5, 9)>
<5, (2, 4, 9)>
