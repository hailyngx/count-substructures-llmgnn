Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [13].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (3, 8, 0)>
<1, (4, 7, 1)>
<1, (5, 2, 1)>
<2, (3, 6, 2)>
<4, (8, 1, 4)>
<5, (6, 2, 5)>
<6, (8, 2, 6)>
<7, (4, 1, 7)>
<8, (0, 6, 8)>
<9, (1, 2, 9)>
<9, (2, 5, 9)>
<9, (1, 7, 9)>
<9, (2, 6, 9)>
