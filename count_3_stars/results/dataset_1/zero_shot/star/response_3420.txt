Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 3 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the answer is [3].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 5, 9)>
<5, (0, 3, 6)>
<7, (1, 8, 9)>
