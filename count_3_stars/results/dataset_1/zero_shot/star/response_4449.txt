Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 8) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are two 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<2, (0, 7, 2)>
<8, (1, 3, 4)>  

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
