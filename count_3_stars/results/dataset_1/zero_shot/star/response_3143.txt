Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [8] 3-stars in the given graph.

Here they are listed below:
<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<4, (1, 2, 5)>
<5, (0, 3, 4)>
<3, (1, 4, 5)>
<2, (0, 4, 1)>
<6, (1, 4, 9)>
<9, (6, 8, 4)>
