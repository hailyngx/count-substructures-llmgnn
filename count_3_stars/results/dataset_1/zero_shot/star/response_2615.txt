Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are <0, (4, 6, 7)>, <2, (1, 5, 6)>, <3, (4, 8, 9)>  in the given graph.
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
