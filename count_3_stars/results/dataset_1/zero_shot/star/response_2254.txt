Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<1, (4, 8, 0)>
<2, (6, 8, 9)>
<3, (4, 4, 9)>
<4, (0, 1, 3)>
