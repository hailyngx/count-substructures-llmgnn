Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph can be counted as follows:

1. Node 0: (0, 3, 7)
2. Node 1: (1, 3, 6)
3. Node 2: (2, 4, 8)
4. Node 3: (3, 0, 7), (3, 1, 7)
5. Node 4: (4, 2, 8), (4, 8, 9)
6. Node 5: No 3-star
7. Node 6: (6, 1, 7), (6, 8, 9)
8. Node 7: (7, 0, 3), (7, 1, 6), (7, 3, 6)
9. Node 8: (8, 4, 9), (8, 6, 9)
10. Node 9: (9, 4, 8), (9, 5, 6), (9, 6, 8)

Therefore, there are a total of [12] 3-stars in the given graph.  

Unique 3-stars: <0, (3, 7, 0)>, <1, (3, 6, 1)>, <2, (4, 8, 2)>, <3, (7, 0, 3)>, <4, (8, 9, 4)>, <6, (7, 9, 6)>, <7, (1, 6, 7)>, <8, (9, 4, 8)>, <9, (6, 8, 9)>.
