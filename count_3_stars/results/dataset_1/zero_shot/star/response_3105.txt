Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 3, 7)>
<2, (3, 4, 6)>
<3, (0, 2, 7)>
<4, (2, 5, 6)>
<5, (1, 4, 7)>
<6, (2, 8, 9)>
<8, (5, 6, 8)>
