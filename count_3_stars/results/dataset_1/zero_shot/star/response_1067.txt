Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 3 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The 3-stars are as follows:
<1, (2, 3, 8)>
<8, (1, 2, 9)>
<9, (1, 8, )>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
