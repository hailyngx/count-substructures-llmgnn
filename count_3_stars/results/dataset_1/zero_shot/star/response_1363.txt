Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 7 3-stars in this graph. Here they are:
  <0, (1, 4, 5)>
  <1, (0, 3, 5)>
  <1, (4, 7, 8)>
  <3, (1, 9, _)>  (Central node 3 with 3 tails)
  <4, (0, 7, 8)>
  <5, (0, 1, 2)>
  <7, (1, 4, 9)>

Therefore, the final answer is [7].
