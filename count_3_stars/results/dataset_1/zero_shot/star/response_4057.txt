Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are 3-stars in the given graph. The count is [7].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 7, 9)>
<4, (3, 5, 6)>
<6, (0, 3, 7)>
<7, (0, 1, 5)>
<8, (2, 4, 6)>
<9, (0, 4, 1)>
<3, (4, 6, 5)>
