Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
The given graph is as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9

Edges: (0, 1), (0, 5), (0, 8), (1, 0), (2, 4), (2, 7), (3, 9), (4, 2), (5, 0), (7, 2), (7, 8), (8, 0), (8, 7), (9, 3)

To find the 3-star graphs, we look for nodes that are connected to exactly 3 other nodes. Let's find the 3-stars and count them.

The 3-stars in this graph are as follows:
<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<2, (4, 7, 8)>
<3, (9)>
<4, (2)>
<5, (0)>
<7, (2, 8)>
<8, (0, 7)>
<9, (3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
