Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
There are three 3-stars in the given graph. The unique 3-stars are <0, (3, 4, 6)>, <1, (2, 3, 7)>, and <2, (1, 8, 9)>. Therefore, the final answer is [3].
