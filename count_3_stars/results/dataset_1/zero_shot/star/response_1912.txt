Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
The given graph contains the following 3-stars: 

<0, (4, 7, 8)>
<1, (8, 3, 9)>
<4, (0, 7, 5)>
<7, (0, 4, 5)>
<8, (1, 3, 4)>
<9, (1, 3, -)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
