Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 7) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 5) (9, 1) 

Response:
There are 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

The 3-stars are:
<0, (5, 7, 8)>
<1, (4, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
