Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph.  
The 3-stars are:  
<0, (2, 3, 4)>  
<5, (2, 8, 9)>  

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
