Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are:
    - <0, (7, 8, 1)>
    - <1, (4, 7, 9)>
    - <7, (0, 1, 2)>
    - <8, (0, 4, 6)>
