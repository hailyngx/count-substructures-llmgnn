Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 3-star structures in the graph with central nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9, but not with central nodes 2 and 6. Let's count the number of 3-stars.

1. Central node 0: (0, 1, 3), (0, 4, 5), (0, 3, 9) -> <0, (1, 3, 9)>, <0, (4, 5)>

2. Central node 1: (1, 0, 3), (1, 4, 9), (1, 7, 8) -> <1, (0, 3, 9)>, <1, (4, 9)>, <1, (7, 8)>

3. Central node 3: (3, 0, 1), (3, 5, 7) -> <3, (0, 1)>, <3, (5, 7)>

4. Central node 4: (4, 0, 9), (4, 6, 8) -> <4, (0, 9)>, <4, (6, 8)>

5. Central node 5: (5, 0, 7), (5, 3, 7) -> <5, (0, 7)>, <5, (3, 7)>

6. Central node 7: (7, 1, 8), (7, 3, 5), (7, 6, 9) -> <7, (1, 8)>, <7, (3, 5)>, <7, (6, 9)>

7. Central node 8: (8, 1, 2), (8, 4, 6) -> <8, (1, 2)>, <8, (4, 6)>

8. Central node 9: (9, 0, 4), (9, 1, 7) -> <9, (0, 4)>, <9, (1, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
