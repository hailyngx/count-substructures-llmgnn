Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<0, (2, 6, 8)>
<0, (4, 6, 9)>
<2, (0, 4, 5)>
<2, (0, 5, 6)>
<4, (0, 2, 5)>
