Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) 

Response:
There are 6 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 2, 6)>
<1, (0, 6, 8)>
<2, (0, 6, 7)>
<2, (5, 6, 8)>
<5, (2, 3, 6)>
<6, (0, 1, 2)>

Therefore, the final answer is [6].
