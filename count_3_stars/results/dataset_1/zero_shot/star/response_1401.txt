Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 5) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph. The unique 3-stars are as follows:
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<1, (0, 2, 6)>
<2, (1, 3, 4)>
<3, (2, 5, -)>
<4, (0, 2, 9)>
<5, (0, 3, 6)>
