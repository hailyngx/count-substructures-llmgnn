Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph. 

<0, (4, 5, 7)>
<3, (2, 4, 5)>
<4, (0, 3, 5)>
<5, (0, 3, 8)>
