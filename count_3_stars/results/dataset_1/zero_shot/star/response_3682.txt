Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph.  

The unique 3-stars are:  
<0, (1, 4, 5)>  
<0, (1, 3, 5)>  
<1, (0, 2, 9)>  
<3, (0, 4, 9)>  
<3, (4, 7, 9)>  
<4, (0, 3, 7)>  
<4, (3, 7, 9)>  
<5, (0, 2, 6)>
