Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be calculated by counting the number of ways to choose a central node with exactly three connections. Since the graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges, we can identify the central nodes and count the corresponding 3-stars.

Here are the 3-stars in the graph with the central node and leaf nodes specified:
<0, (2, 4, 7)>
<0, (2, 4, 8)>
<0, (2, 4, 0)>
<0, (2, 4, 9)>
<0, (4, 2, 0)>
<0, (4, 2, 9)>
<0, (7, 0, 8)>
<0, (7, 0, 4)>
<0, (8, 0, 2)>
<0, (8, 0, 4)>
<0, (8, 0, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [11].
