Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are a total of [5] 3-stars in this graph.
  
The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<1, (0, 8, 5)>
<4, (2, 3, 7)>
<5, (0, 6, 7)>
<4, (7, 9, 2)>
