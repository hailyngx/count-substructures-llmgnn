Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The central nodes and leaves form a 3-star in a graph. Let's find all the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. We need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes through edges as this represents a 3-star structure.
2. We start by checking each node to see if they have exactly three edges connected to them.
3. For each node that fulfills this condition, we identify the 3-star with that node as the center and the nodes connected to it as leaves.

After analyzing the graph, we find the following 3-stars:
<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<0, (4, 5, 8)>
<0, (4, 5, 9)>
<4, (0, 5, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
