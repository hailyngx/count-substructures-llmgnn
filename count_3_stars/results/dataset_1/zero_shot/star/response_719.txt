Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 6, 8)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<3, (1, 5, 9)>
<4, (1, 8, 5)>
<5, (3, 8, 9)>
<6, (0, 7, 8)>
