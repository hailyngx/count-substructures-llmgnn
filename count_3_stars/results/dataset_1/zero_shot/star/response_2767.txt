Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [5] 3-stars in the given graph. The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (4, 7, 9)>
<3, (1, 7, 9)>
<2, (4, 5, 8)>
<6, (1, 2, 5)>
<7, (0, 3, 6)>
