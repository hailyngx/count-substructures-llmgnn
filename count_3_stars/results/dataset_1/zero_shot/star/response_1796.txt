Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph consists of the following 3-star configurations:
- <0, (2, 4, 6)>
- <1, (2, 3, 6)>
- <2, (0, 1, 3)>
- <4, (0, 5, 6)>
- <5, (4, 7, 8)>
- <6, (1, 4, 9)>
- <7, (5, 9, 2)>
- <8, (5, 9, 2)>
- <9, (2, 4, 6)>
  
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
