Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 2) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 6, 9)>
<2, (0, 8, 9)>
<3, (5, 6, 7)>
<4, (5, 8, 2)>
