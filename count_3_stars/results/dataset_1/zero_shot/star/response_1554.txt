Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 8 3-stars in this graph. 
The 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 2, 3)>
<1, (3, 7, 8)>
<2, (4, 8, 9)>
<3, (1, 4, 7)>
<4, (0, 2, 3)>
<5, (7, 8, 6)>
<7, (1, 3, 5)>
<8, (1, 2, 9)>

So, the final answer is [8].
