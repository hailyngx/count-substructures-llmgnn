Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The total number of 3-star configurations in the given graph can be counted by examining all possible nodes and their connections to three other nodes in a star pattern.

The 3-star configurations are:
<0, (2, 4, 9)>
<2, (0, 9, 3)>
<3, (0, 5, 7)>
<5, (3, 7, 9)>
<7, (3, 5, 9)>
<9, (0, 2, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
