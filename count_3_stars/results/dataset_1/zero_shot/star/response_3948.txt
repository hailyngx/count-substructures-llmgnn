Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated by checking each node that is connected to exactly 3 other nodes. Let's check each node in the graph:

- Node 0: Connected to nodes 4, 5, 6, 9
  <0, (4, 5, 6)> [3-star]

- Node 1: Connected to nodes 3, 7, 8
  <1, (3, 7, 8)> [3-star]

- Node 2: Connected to nodes 7, 8, 9
  <2, (7, 8, 9)> [3-star]

- Node 3: Connected to nodes 1, 4, 8
  <3, (1, 4, 8)> [3-star]

- Node 4: Connected to nodes 0, 3, 5, 7, 8
  <4, (0, 3, 5)> [3-star]
  <4, (3, 5, 7)> [3-star]
  <4, (3, 6, 9)> [3-star]

- Node 5: Connected to nodes 0, 4
  <5, (0, 4, 6)> [3-star]

- Node 6: Connected to nodes 0, 9
  <6, (0, 4, 5)> [3-star]

- Node 7: Connected to nodes 1, 2, 4
  <7, (1, 3, 8)> [3-star]

- Node 8: Connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 4
  <8, (1, 3, 7)> [3-star]

- Node 9: Connected to nodes 0, 2, 6
  <9, (0, 6, 4)> [3-star]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
