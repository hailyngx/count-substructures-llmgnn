Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are a total of 3-stars in the given graph. The unique 3-stars are:
  
  <> [3] (2, 4, 8)
  <> [1] (6, 1, 9)
  <> [1] (6, 9, 1)
  <> [2] (2, 7, 3)
  <> [1] (2, 4, 3)
  <> [1] (8, 0, 3)
  <> [1] (8, 3, 0) 
  <> [1] (2, 3, 4) 
  <> [1] (4, 2, 3)  
  <> [1] (1, 6, 9)

So the final answer is: [10].
