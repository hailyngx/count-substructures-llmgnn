Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are:

1. <0, (3, 4, 6)>
2. <0, (6, 7, 9)>
3. <2, (5, 6, 8)>
4. <6, (0, 1, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
