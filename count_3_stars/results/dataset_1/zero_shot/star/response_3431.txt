Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are 2 unique 3-stars in this graph. Here is the list of the 3-stars:

<4, (1, 3, 7)>
<9, (0, 3, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
