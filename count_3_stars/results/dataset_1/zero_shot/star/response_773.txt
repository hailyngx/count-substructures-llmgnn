Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are [2] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 2, 8)>
<9, (0, 3, 5)>
