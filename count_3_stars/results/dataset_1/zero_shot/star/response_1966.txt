Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be calculated by looking at each node and checking if it is the center of a 3-star. Nodes with degree at least 3 are potential centers.

Let's list the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<3, (1, 4, 5)>
<4, (0, 1, 3)>
<5, (0, 1, 3)>
<6, (3, 9, 7)>
<7, (1, 9, 6)>
<8, (0, 1, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 6)>

Counting these unique 3-stars gives us a total of [9].
