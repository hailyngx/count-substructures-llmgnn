Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of [4] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<2, (3, 6, 7)>
<5, (7, 8, -1)>
<8, (5, 9, -1)>
