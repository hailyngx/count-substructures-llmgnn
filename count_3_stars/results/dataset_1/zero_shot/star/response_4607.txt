Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are two 3-stars in the given graph. 
The unique 3-stars are <0, (3, 4, 9)> and <3, (0, 2, 6)>.
Therefore, the final answer is [2].
