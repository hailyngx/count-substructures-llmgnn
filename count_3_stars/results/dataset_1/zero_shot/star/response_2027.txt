Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are a total of 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The list of unique 3-stars is as follows:
<0, (4, 6, 9)>
<1, (3, 5, 6)>
<2, (3, 4, 5)>
<4, (0, 2, 5)>
<6, (0, 1, 3)> 

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
