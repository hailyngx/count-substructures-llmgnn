Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are:

<2, (3, 5, 8)>
<3, (2, 7, 9)>
<4, (5, 6, 8)>
<5, (2, 4, 6)>
<6, (4, 5, 8)>
<8, (2, 4, 5)>

Therefore, there are a total of [6] 3-stars in the graph.
