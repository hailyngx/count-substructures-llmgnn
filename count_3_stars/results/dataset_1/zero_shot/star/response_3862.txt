Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph. 
 
The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 5, 7)>
<1, (4, 5, 7)>
<2, (0, 5, 7)>
<5, (0, 2, 7)>
<7, (0, 1, 2)>
<8, (3, 6, 9)>
