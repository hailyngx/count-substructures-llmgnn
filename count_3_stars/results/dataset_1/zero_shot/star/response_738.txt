Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 10 nodes and 30 edges in the given graph. Let's count the number of 3-star graphs in this network.

The possible 3-stars in this graph are as follows:
<0, (1, 4, 7)>
<1, (0, 4, 8)>
<2, (5, 9, -)>
<3, (4, 5, 8)>
<4, (0, 1, 3)>
<5, (2, 3, 4)>
<6, (8, 9, -)>
<7, (0, -, -)>
<8, (1, 3, 6)>
<9, (2, 3, 6)>

Overall, there are 10 possible 3-stars in the given graph. Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
