Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are no 3-star structures in the given graph, which can be verified by observing that each node has either 0, 1, or 2 neighbors. Hence, the total count is [0], and the unique 3-stars are <> (empty set).
