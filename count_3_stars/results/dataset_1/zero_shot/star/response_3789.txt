Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in this graph.  

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 5, 8)>
<2, (0, 1, 6)>
<2, (1, 5, 6)>
<2, (5, 6, 0)>
<2, (5, 6, 1)>
<6, (2, 3, 7)>
