Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 3) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of [10] nodes and [28] edges in the given graph.

The 3-star graphs in the given graph are:
<1, (3, 4, 5)>
<2, (9, 6, 0)>
<3, (1, 4, 7)>
<4, (3, 5, 6)>
<5, (4, 6, 8)>
<6, (4, 5, 9)>
<7, (0, 3, 5)>
<8, (5, 7, 9)>
<9, (2, 6, 8)>
<0, (7, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [10].
