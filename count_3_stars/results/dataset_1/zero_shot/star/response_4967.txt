Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 5, -)>
<1, (0, 4, -)>
<3, (4, 5, 7)>
<4, (1, 2, 3)>
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
