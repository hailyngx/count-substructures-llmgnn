Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of 4 unique 3-stars present in the given graph.

The 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 9, 2)>
<3, (4, 6, 9)>
<7, (5, 6, 9)>
<8, (6, 9, 7)>

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
