Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph, which are as follows:
  
<0, (5, 8, 2)>
<1, (7, 9, 2)>
<2, (7, 8, 9)>
<7, (1, 9, 2)>
<9, (1, 7, 2)>
