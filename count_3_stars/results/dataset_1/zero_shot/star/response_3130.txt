Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are three 3-stars in the given graph. Below are the unique 3-stars found:

<0, (7, 9, 5)>
<1, (4, 6, 8)>
<9, (0, 4, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
