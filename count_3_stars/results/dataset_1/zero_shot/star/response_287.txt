Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are 3 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (6, 9, 5)>
<1, (5, 7, 8)>
<6, (0, 5, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
