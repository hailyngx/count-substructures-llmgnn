Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The list of unique 3-stars is as follows:
<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<1, (0, 3, 7)>
<3, (0, 1, 7)>
<4, (1, 2, 5)>
Therefore, the final answer is [4].
