Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 2) 

Response:
There are 3 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
So, the final answer is [3].
The unique 3-stars are: 
<2, (1, 8, 9)>
<3, (6, 7, 8)>
<4, (0, 1, 2)>
