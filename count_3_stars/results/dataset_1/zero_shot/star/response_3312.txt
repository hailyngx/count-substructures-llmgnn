Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 3-stars in the given graph:

- <0, (1, 3, 4)>
- <2, (3, 5, 6)>
- <5, (2, 4, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
