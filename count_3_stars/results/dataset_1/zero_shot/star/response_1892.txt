Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-star structures in this graph. The 3-star structures are:

<0, (3, 4, 9)>
<1, (4, 6, 7)>
<2, (5, 6, 8)>
<3, (0, 4, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
