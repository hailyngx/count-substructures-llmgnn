Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 2 unique 3-stars in this graph. The 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 5, 9)>
<3, (0, 4, 8)>
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
