Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 8) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) 

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph can be counted based on the definition provided. Here they are:

There are a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph. 

Here are the unique 3-star configurations <center node, (leaf node 1, leaf node 2, leaf node 3)> inside <>:
<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<0, (2, 4, 7)>
<0, (4, 7, 8)>
<0, (4, 7, 8)>
<0, (4, 8, 7)>
<2, (0, 8, 4)>
<4, (0, 7, 8)>
<4, (7, 8, 0)>
