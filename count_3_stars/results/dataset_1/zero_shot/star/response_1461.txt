Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 3 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
The 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 4, 8)>
<0, (4, 1, 9)>
<7, (2, 5, 6)>
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
