Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [2] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (0, 5, 1)>
<6, (2, 3, 4)>
