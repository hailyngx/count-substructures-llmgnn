Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are as follows:
- <1, (2, 5, 6)>
- <2, (1, 5, 6)>
- <5, (1, 2, 7)>
- <6, (1, 2, 7)>
- <7, (1, 5, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
