Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph.  

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<3, (5, 4, 7)>
<4, (5, 7, 3)>
<5, (3, 7, 4)>
<6, (7, 9, 6)>
<7, (3, 4, 5)>
<9, (6, 8, 7)>
