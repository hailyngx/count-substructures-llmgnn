Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:
- <0, (2, 4, 8)>
- <2, (0, 5, 7)>
- <3, (2, 7, 8)>
- <4, (0, 5, 9)>
- <5, (1, 2, 7)>
- <7, (2, 5, 9)>
- <9, (2, 4, 6)>

There are a total of [7] 3-stars in the graph.
