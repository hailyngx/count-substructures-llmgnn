Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 1) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (3, 4, 7)>
<1, (3, 5, 7)>
<1, (3, 7, 9)>
