Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are along with the central node and leaf nodes:

<0, (1, 2, 9)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<2, (0, 4, 5)>
<3, (1, 4, 9)>
<4, (1, 2, 8)>
<5, (2, 3, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
