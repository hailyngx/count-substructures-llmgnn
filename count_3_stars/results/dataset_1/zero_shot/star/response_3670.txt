Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [8] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (6, 7, 1)>
<1, (2, 9, 7)>
<2, (1, 3, 6)>
<2, (6, 8, 9)>
<3, (2, 6, )]
<4, (1, 5, 8)>
<5, (1, 6, 8)>
<6, (0, 2, 3)>
