Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are as follows:
    - <0, (1, 4, 7)>
    - <1, (0, 2, 3)>
    - <2, (1, 5, 6)>
    - <3, (1, 4, 7)>
    - <4, (0, 3, 7)>
    - <5, (1, 2, 9)>
    - <6, (2, 9, 7)>
    - <7, (0, 1, 3)>
    - <9, (6, 5, 7)>
    
Hence, the total number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [9].
