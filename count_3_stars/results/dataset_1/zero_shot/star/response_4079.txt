Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 4 different 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are:

<1, (2, 3, 8)>
<3, (1, 5, 6)>
<6, (3, 7, 8)>
<7, (5, 6, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
