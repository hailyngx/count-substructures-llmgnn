Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph can be calculated by identifying the central node and its respective neighboring nodes. 
From the given edges, we can identify the 3-stars as follows:
1. <0, (3, 5, 6)>
2. <1, (6, 8, -)>
3. <2, (4, 5, 7)>
4. <3, (0, 9, -)>
5. <4, (2, 8, 9)>
6. <5, (0, 2, -)>
7. <6, (0, 1, 7)>
8. <7, (2, 6, -)>
9. <8, (1, 4, 6)>
10. <9, (3, 4, 6)>

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
