Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<4, (2, 3, 5)>
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
