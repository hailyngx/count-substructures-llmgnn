Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be calculated by counting the number of unique 3-stars based on the given edges. 

Based on the given edges, the 3-stars in the graph are as follows:
<0, (3, 6, 7)>
<1, (4, 9, 2)>
<2, (5, 6, 7)>
<3, (0, 9, 2)>
<4, (1, 7, 2)>
<7, (0, 2, 4)>
<9, (1, 2, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
