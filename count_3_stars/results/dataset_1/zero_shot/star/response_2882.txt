Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 7) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph contains the following 3-stars:
<0, (2, 9, 1)>
<2, (0, 1, 4)>
<3, (1, 2, 7)>
<4, (2, 7, -)>
<6, (3, -, -)>
<7, (3, 4, 9)>
<9, (7, 0, -)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
