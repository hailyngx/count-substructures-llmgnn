Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The center nodes in this graph are: 0, 2, 4, and 5.

For center node 0:
- Leaves: 3, 9
- <0, (3, 9)>

For center node 2:
- Leaves: 5, 8, 9
- <2, (5, 8, 9)>

For center node 4:
- Leaves: 3, 5, 7, 8
- <4, (3, 5, 7)>
- <4, (3, 8, 5)>
- <4, (5, 7, 8)>

For center node 5:
- Leaves: 2, 4, 7, 9
- <5, (2, 4, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
