Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 9, 3)>
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<1, (2, 3, 5)>
