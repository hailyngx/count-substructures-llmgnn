Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 7 total 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 8, 9)>
<1, (0, 8, 9)>
<4, (7, 5, 6)>
<5, (6, 7, 5)>
<6, (5, 7, 9)>
<7, (4, 5, 6)>
<9, (0, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the final answer is [7].
