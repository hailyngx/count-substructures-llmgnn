Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<1, (4, 5, 9)>
<3, (0, 4, 5)>
<3, (4, 5, 8)>
<6, (7, 9, 3)>
<9, (1, 2, 8)>
