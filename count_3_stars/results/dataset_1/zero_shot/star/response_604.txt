Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the graph can be found by counting the number of nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

1. <5, (0, 4, 7)>
2. <6, (2, 7, 9)>
3. <7, (1, 5, 6)>
4. <8, (0, 2, 6)>
5. <9, (5, 6, *not connected to any other node*)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
