Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

The 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<4, (0, 1, 8)>
<6, (1, 5, 7)>
<7, (2, 5, 9)> 

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
