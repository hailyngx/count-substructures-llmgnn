Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are:

[<0, (1, 3, 9)>, <1, (0, 7, 9)>, <2, (4, 9, 9)>, <3, (0, 6, 9)>, <4, (2, 5, 8)>, <5, (4, 4, 4)>, <6, (3, 3, 3)>, <7, (1, 8, 9)>, <8, (4, 7, 7)>, <9, (0, 2, 3)>]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
