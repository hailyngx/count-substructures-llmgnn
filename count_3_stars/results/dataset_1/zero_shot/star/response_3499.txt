Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
    The unique 3-stars found are <0, (5, 7, 9)>, <1, (4, 6, 8)>, <1, (6, 8, 9)>, <3, (7, 8, 9)>, <4, (1, 6, 8)>, and <7, (3, 8, 9)>.
