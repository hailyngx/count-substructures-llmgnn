Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph. The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (4, 8, 9)>
<1, (3, 5, 6)>
<3, (1, 5, 8)>
<5, (1, 2, 3)>
