Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars: 

<0, (4, 7, 1)>
<1, (3, 5, 7)>
<2, (5, 9, 6)>
<3, (1, 5, 7)>
<4, (0, 7, 5)>
<5, (2, 6, 1)>
<6, (1, 5, 9)>
<7, (0, 1, 3)>
<8, (3, 7, 1)>
<9, (2, 6, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
