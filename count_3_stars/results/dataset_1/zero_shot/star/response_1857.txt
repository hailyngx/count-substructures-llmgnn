Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
There are 3 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

The 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 7, 8)>
<7, (0, 4, 6)>
<8, (0, 5, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
