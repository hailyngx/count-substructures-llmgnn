Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
   
   The unique 3-stars found are:
   <0, (1, 8, 2)>
   <2, (3, 5, 8)>
   <3, (2, 4, 8)>
   <4, (3, 6, 8)>
