Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.  
The unique 3-stars are:  
<0, (4, 1, 2)>  
<2, (3, 7, 8)>  
<3, (2, 7, 8)>  
<4, (0, 1, 6)>
