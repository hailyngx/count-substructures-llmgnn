Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [5] 3-stars in the given graph. 

<0, (3, 9, 4)>
<3, (0, 6, 8)>
<4, (5, 9, 6)>
<5, (4, 7, 9)>
<6, (2, 3, 4)>
