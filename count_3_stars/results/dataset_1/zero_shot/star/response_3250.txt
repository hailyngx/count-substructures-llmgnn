Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the graph can be counted by identifying the central node and its three connected nodes. Since each 3-star is unique, we need to analyze each possible central node and its connected nodes. Let's start listing the unique 3-stars below:

<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<1, (0, 4, 8)>
<2, (5, 7, 9)>
<3, (4, 5, 8)>
<4, (1, 3, 8)>
<5, (2, 3, 9)>
<6, (0, 8, 9)>
<7, (0, 2, 5)>
<8, (0, 3, 4)>
<9, (0, 5, 8)>

Therefore, there are a total of [10] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
