Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 4 different 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are listed as unique combinations:

1. <0, (1, 5, 8)>
2. <1, (0, 3, 4)>
3. <3, (1, 5, 9)>
4. <6, (1, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
