Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<1, (2, 3, 6)>
<2, (0, 1, 4)>
<9, (4, 5, 6)>
