Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (1, 5, 9)>, <4, (7, 8, 9)>, <5, (0, 7, 9)>, and <9, (0, 6, 8)>.
