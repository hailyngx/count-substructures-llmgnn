Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 3 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Hence, the output is [3].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (7, 8, 9)>
<2, (3, 5, 7)>
<5, (2, 4, 6)>
