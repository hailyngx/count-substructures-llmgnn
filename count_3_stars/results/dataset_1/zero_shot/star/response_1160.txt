Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:

[<0, (2, 6, 1)>, <1, (4, 8, 6)>, <5, (6, 9, 7)>, <8, (1, 9, 7)>]
