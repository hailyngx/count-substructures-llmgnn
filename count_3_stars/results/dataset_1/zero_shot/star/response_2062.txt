Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be calculated by counting the number of unique nodes that can act as the central node of a 3-star.

From the information provided, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<1, (3, 6, 5)>
<2, (3, 4, 9)>
<3, (1, 2, 4)>
<4, (2, 3, 5)>
<5, (3, 6, 7)>
<6, (1, 3, 8)>
<7, (5, 9, 7)>
<8, (6, 5, 8)>

Hence, there are a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
