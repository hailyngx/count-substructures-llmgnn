Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph. 

<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<3, (0, 6, 8)>
<4, (0, 1, 6)>
<8, (3, 4, 5)>
