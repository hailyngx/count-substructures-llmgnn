Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 9) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph. 
The unique 3-stars are <0, (2, 5, 6)>, <0, (2, 5, 8)>, <0, (6, 5, 8)>, and <9, (2, 3, 7)>.
