Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
There are 3-star configurations present in the given graph. Here is the list of unique 3-stars found:
    
    <0, (3, 4, 5)>
    <2, (3, 8, 9)>
    
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
