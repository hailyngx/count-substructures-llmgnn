Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph. 
The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 4, 7)>
<1, (3, 4, 7)>
<2, (0, 7, 9)>
<3, (1, 4, 7)>
<4, (0, 3, 7)>
<7, (0, 1, 2)>
