Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 4 different 3-stars in the graph. The count is [4].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<6, (3, 4, 8)>
<9, (1, 6, 7)>
<7, (5, 8, 9)>
