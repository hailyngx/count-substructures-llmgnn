Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of [4] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 4, 7)>
<1, (0, 5, 6)>
<4, (0, 3, 6)>
<8, (0, 2, 9)>
