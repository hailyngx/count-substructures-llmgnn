Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 6) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 8 unique 3-stars in this graph. Here they are listed along with their central node and leaf nodes:
  
  - <0, (1, 6, 6)>
  - <1, (0, 4, 4)>
  - <4, (1, 6, 9)>
  - <6, (0, 2, 5)>
  - <6, (0, 4, 9)>
  - <6, (2, 4, 5)>
  - <6, (4, 5, 9)>
  - <9, (4, 6, 6)>
  
Therefore, the final answer is [8].
