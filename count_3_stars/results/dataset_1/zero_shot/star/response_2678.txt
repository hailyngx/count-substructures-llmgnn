Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 3-stars in the given graph. The count is [7].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<1, (4, 6, 7)>
<1, (6, 7, 8)>
<1, (7, 8, 9)>
<2, (1, 6, 8)>
<4, (1, 3, 7)>
<6, (1, 2, 7)>
