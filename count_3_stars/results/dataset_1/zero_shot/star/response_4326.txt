Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be calculated by finding the number of nodes that can be the center of a 3-star. Since each 3-star has a center connected to exactly three other nodes, we need to find nodes with at least three neighbors.

By examining the adjacency list:

Node 0 has 1 neighbor.
Node 1 has 4 neighbors.
Node 2 has 3 neighbors.
Node 3 has 2 neighbors.
Node 4 has 3 neighbors.
Node 5 has 3 neighbors.
Node 6 has 1 neighbor.
Node 7 has 5 neighbors.
Node 8 has 3 neighbors.
Node 9 has 4 neighbors.

Therefore, the nodes that can be the center of a 3-star are: 1, 4, 5, 7, and 9.

Now, let's list the 3-stars in the given graph:

<1, (2, 7, 4)>
<1, (4, 7, 1)>
<1, (7, 2, 4)>
<1, (7, 4, 1)>
<4, (0, 1, 6)>
<4, (1, 0, 6)>
<4, (6, 0, 1)>
<4, (6, 1, 0)>
<5, (3, 7, 9)>
<5, (7, 3, 9)>
<5, (7, 9, 3)>
<5, (9, 3, 7)>
<7, (1, 3, 5)>
<7, (3, 1, 5)>
<7, (3, 5, 1)>
<7, (5, 1, 3)>
<9, (2, 5, 8)>
<9, (5, 2, 8)>
<9, (5, 8, 2)>
<9, (8, 2, 5)>
<9, (2, 7, 8)>
<9, (7, 2, 8)>
<9, (7, 8, 2)>
<9, (8, 2, 7)>
<9, (5, 7, 8)>
<9, (7, 5, 8)>
<9, (7, 8, 5)>
<9, (8, 5, 7)>

Counting the total number of listed 3-stars gives us 28 unique 3-stars.

Therefore, the final answer is [28].
