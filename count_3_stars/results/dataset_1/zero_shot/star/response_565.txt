Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are:

<0, (7, 9, _)>  
<2, (3, 4, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
