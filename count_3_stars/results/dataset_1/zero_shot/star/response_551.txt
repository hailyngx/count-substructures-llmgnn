Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be calculated by identifying the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's first determine the unique 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (2, 7, 1)>
<1, (2, 4, 7)>
<2, (0, 1, 4)>
<4, (1, 2, 5)>
<5, (2, 4, 6)>
<6, (3, 5, 9)>
<7, (0, 1, 4)>
<9, (4, 6, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
