Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) 

Response:
There are [2] unique 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
