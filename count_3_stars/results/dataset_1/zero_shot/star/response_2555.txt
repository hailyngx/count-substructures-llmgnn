Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:

[<0, (1, 2, 4)>]
[<1, (0, 5, 6)>]
[<2, (0, 5, 8)>]
[<3, (4, 5, 7)>]
[<4, (0, 3, 5)>]
[<5, (1, 2, 8)>]
[<6, (1, 7, 8)>]
[<7, (3, 6, 9)>]
[<8, (2, 5, 6)>]
[<9, (6, 7, 9)>]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
