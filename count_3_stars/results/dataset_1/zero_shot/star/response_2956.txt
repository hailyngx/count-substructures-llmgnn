Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The total number of 3-star structures in the given graph can be counted by examining each node's neighbors and checking for 3-stars connected to that node as the center. In this case, since the graph has 10 nodes, we need to search for 3-stars using each of these nodes as potential centers.

Let's determine the 3-stars in the given graph:
1. Node 0: No 3-stars can be formed as the center since it only has one neighbor (Node 4).
2. Node 1: <1, (5, 6, 7)> [1]
3. Node 2: This node has no connections in the given graph.
4. Node 3: No 3-stars can be formed as the center since it only has one neighbor (Node 4).
5. Node 4: <4, (0, 3, 7)> [2]
6. Node 5: <5, (1, 9, 6)> [3]
7. Node 6: <6, (1, 9, 5)> [4]
8. Node 7: <7, (1, 4, 8)> [5]
9. Node 8: <8, (7)> [6]
10. Node 9: <9, (1, 5, 6)> [7]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
