Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 6, 8)>
<3, (5, 6, 8)>
<6, (0, 3, 5)>
<7, (6, 8, 9)>
