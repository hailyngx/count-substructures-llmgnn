Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are:

<1, (4, 5, 6)>
<5, (1, 4, 6)>
<6, (1, 5, 7)>
<7, (1, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
