Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 8 3-stars in the given graph. The unique 3-stars are:

<0, (6, 8, 9)>
<1, (2, 3, 9)>
<2, (1, 5, 7)>
<3, (1, 6, 9)>
<5, (2, 6, 9)>
<6, (0, 3, 4)>
<7, (2, 5, 9)>
<9, (1, 5, 7)>

Therefore, the final answer is: [8].
