Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
The center node in a 3-star graph is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's find all the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (2, 3, 4)>
2. <3, (0, 2, 6)>
3. <4, (0, 5, -)>
4. <6, (0, 3, -)>
  
Therefore, there are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The final answer is [4].
