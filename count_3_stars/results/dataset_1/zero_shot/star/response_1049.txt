Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are three 3-stars in the given graph. 

The three unique 3-stars are:
1. <0, (3, 8, 4)>
2. <1, (5, 6, 2)>
3. <7, (6, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
