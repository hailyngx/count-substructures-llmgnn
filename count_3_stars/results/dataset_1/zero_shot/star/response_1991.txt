Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [8] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<1, (0, 3, 5)>
<2, (3, 4, 6)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<4, (2, 8, 9)>
<5, (0, 1, 6)>
<6, (2, 3, 5)>
<8, (1, 2, 9)>
