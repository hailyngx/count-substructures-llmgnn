Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the graph can be calculated by finding all the 3-node paths. In this case, a 3-star is a special case of a 3-node path.
Given that a 3-star graph consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can identify each 3-star by looking at the nodes adjacent to each node in the graph.

Let's identify the 3-stars:

1. Node 0: Not a part of any 3-star (as it has only 2 adjacent nodes)
2. Node 1: Not a part of any 3-star (as it has only 2 adjacent nodes)
3. Node 2: 
   - <2, (1, 4, 6)> 
   - <2, (1, 6, 8)>
4. Node 3: <3, (2, 5, 7)>
5. Node 4: Not a part of any 3-star (as it has only 2 adjacent nodes)
6. Node 5: Not a part of any 3-star (as it has only 2 adjacent nodes)
7. Node 6: 
   - <6, (0, 3, 8)>
   - <6, (0, 7, 8)>
8. Node 7: Not a part of any 3-star (as it has only 2 adjacent nodes)
9. Node 8: Not a part of any 3-star (as it has only 2 adjacent nodes)
10. Node 9: Not a part of any 3-star (as it has only 2 adjacent nodes)

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4]. 
The 3-stars are <2, (1, 4, 6)>, <2, (1, 6, 8)>, <3, (2, 5, 7)>, and <6, (0, 3, 8)>.
