Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 8 3-stars in the given graph. The unique 3-stars are <0, (1, 4, 8)>, <1, (0, 2, 8)>, <2, (1, 3, 8)>, <3, (2, 4, 9)>, <4, (0, 3, 8)>, <5, (8, 9, 6)>, <6, (7, 9, 5)>, and <7, (6, 9, 5)>. Therefore, the final answer is [8].
