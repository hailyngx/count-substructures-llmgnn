Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated using the formula: total 3-stars = number of nodes connected to exactly 3 nodes. Since each 3-star has one central node and three leaf nodes, we need to find nodes that act as a center in a 3-star.

Let's identify the nodes in the graph that are connected to exactly 3 other nodes:

- Node 1 is connected to 3 nodes (2, 5, 6).
- Node 2 is connected to 3 nodes (1, 7, 9).
- Node 3 is connected to 3 nodes (6, 7, 8).
- Node 4 is connected to 3 nodes (6, 7, 8).
- Node 6 is connected to 3 nodes (1, 3, 4).
- Node 7 is connected to 3 nodes (2, 3, 4).
- Node 8 is connected to 3 nodes (3, 4).
- Node 9 is connected to 3 nodes (2, 3).

Therefore, the nodes that can act as the center of a 3-star are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9.

Let's count the total number of 3-stars in the given graph.

[8]

The unique 3-stars are as follows:
<1, (2, 5, 6)>
<2, (1, 7, 9)>
<3, (6, 7, 8)>
<4, (6, 7, 8)>
<6, (1, 3, 4)>
<7, (2, 3, 4)>
<8, (3, 4)>
<9, (2, 3)>
