Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 5 unique 3-stars in this graph. Here is the count and the list of unique 3-stars:

[5]
<1, (3, 4, 8)>
<3, (1, 4, 5)>
<4, (1, 3, 5)>
<5, (3, 4, 9)>
<8, (1, 4, 6)>
