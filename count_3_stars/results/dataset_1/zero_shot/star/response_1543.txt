Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are 3 unique 3-stars in the given graph, which can be represented as follows: 
<0, (3, 7, 9)>
<1, (2, 5, 6)>
<2, (1, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
