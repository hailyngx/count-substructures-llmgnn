Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The list of unique 3-stars is as follows:

<0, (3, 4, 7)>
<1, (2, 3, 4)>
<4, (0, 1, 8)>
<6, (1, 4, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
