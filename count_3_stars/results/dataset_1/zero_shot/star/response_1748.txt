Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are two 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are written as <center, (leaf1, leaf2, leaf3)>:
<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<6, (2, 3, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
