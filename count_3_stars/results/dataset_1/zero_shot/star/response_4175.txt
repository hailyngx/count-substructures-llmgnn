Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 5) (9, 1) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<3, (2, 4, 5)>
<4, (3, 5, 7)>
<5, (1, 3, 4)>
<5, (7, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
