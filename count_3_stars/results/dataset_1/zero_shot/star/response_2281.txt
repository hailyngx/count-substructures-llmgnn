Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 5.  

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (3, 5, 7)>
<1, (3, 6, 7)>
<2, (4, 8, 0)>
<3, (0, 1, 4)>
<4, (2, 3, 5)>

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
