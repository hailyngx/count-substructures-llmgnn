Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The unique 3-stars are as follows:
<0, (2, 5, 7)>
<2, (0, 4, 8)>
<3, (4, 5, 7)>
<4, (2, 3, 6)>
Therefore, the final answer is [4].
