Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are:

<0, (1, 8, 9)>
<1, (0, 6, 8)>
<2, (6, 7, 9)>
<3, (4, 8, -)>
<4, (3, 6, 7)>
<5, (6, 8, -)>
<6, (1, 2, 4)>
<7, (2, 4, 6)>
<8, (0, 1, 5)>
<9, (0, 2, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
