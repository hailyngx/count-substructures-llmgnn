Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 1) (9, 0) 

Response:
There is only one 3-star in the given graph. Here is the list of the unique 3-star:
  
  <<0, (6, 9)>>
  
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1].
