Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in this graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 3, 7)>
<7, (0, 4, 5)>
<2, (0, 3, 9)>
<8, (2, 4, 6)>
