Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
The graph has the following 3-stars:
[<0, (5, 6, 9)>, <1, (3, 5, 7)>, <2, (3, 6, X)>, <3, (1, 2, 5)>, <4, (5, 7, 8)>, <7, (1, 3, 4)>]
Therefore, there are a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
