Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
Counting the number of 3-stars in this graph: 
[3]

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<3, (0, 4, 9)>
<8, (1, 3, 9)>
