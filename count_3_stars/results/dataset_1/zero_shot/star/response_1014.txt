Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph. Here are the unique 3-stars found:
  
<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<1, (0, 3, 7)>
<3, (0, 1, 5)>
<5, (0, 3, 7)>
<9, (0, 3, 6)>
