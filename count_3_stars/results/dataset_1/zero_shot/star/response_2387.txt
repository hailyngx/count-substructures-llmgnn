Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are:
1. <0, (1, 8, 9)>
2. <1, (0, 4, 8)>
3. <4, (0, 1, 5)>
4. <5, (0, 2, 7)>
5. <6, (0, 4, 9)>
6. <8, (0, 1, 7)>
7. <9, (0, 3, 6)>

Therefore, there are a total of [7] 3-star graphs in the given graph.
