Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) 

Response:
The 3-stars in this graph are as follows: 

<0, (4, 5, 8)>
<1, (2, 4, 5)>
<3, (4, 5, 7)>
<8, (0, 1, 2)>

Therefore, there are a total of [4] 3-stars in the given graph.
