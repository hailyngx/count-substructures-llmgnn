Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<0, (2, 6, 8)>
<2, (0, 3, 6)>
<4, (0, 6, 7)>
<6, (0, 1, 2)>
<8, (0, 2, 5)>
