Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [3] 3-stars in the given graph. The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<3, (1, 5, 8)>
<7, (0, 8, 9)>
