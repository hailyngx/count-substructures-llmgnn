Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-star structures:
[<0, (5, 6, 9)>, <2, (4, 6, 9)>, <4, (2, 9, 5)>, <6, (2, 5, 7)>, <8, (6, 9, 9)>]
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
