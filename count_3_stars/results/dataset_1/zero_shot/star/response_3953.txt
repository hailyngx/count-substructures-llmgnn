Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
The graph has the following 3-stars:
1. <0, (5, 9, 1)>
2. <1, (5, 9, 6)>
3. <2, (4, 7, 8)>
4. <3, (7, 9, -)>
5. <4, (2, 8, -)>
6. <5, (0, 1, 8)>
7. <6, (1, -, -)>
8. <7, (2, 3, -)>
9. <8, (4, 5, -)>
10. <9, (0, 1, 3)>

Therefore, there are a total of [10] 3-stars in the graph.
