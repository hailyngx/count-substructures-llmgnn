Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<3, (0, 6, 7)>
<4, (0, 6, 9)>
<6, (3, 4, 7)>
<7, (2, 3, 6)>
<9, (5, 6, 9)>
