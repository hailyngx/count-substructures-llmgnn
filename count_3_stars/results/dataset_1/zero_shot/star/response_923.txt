Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 2 three-star structures in the given graph.
The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<2, (4, 5, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
