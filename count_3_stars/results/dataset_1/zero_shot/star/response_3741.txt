Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (5, 8, 1)>
<3, (5, 6, 7)>
<4, (8, 0, 5)>
<7, (3, 6, 9)>
