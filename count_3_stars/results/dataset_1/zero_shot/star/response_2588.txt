Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has 5 potential 3-stars. Here they are:

1. <0, (1, 3, 6)>
2. <1, (0, 2, 4)>
3. <2, (1, 6, 7)>
4. <3, (0, 5, 9)>
5. <4, (1, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
