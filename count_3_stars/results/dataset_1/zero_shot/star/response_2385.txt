Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].

The unique 3-stars found are:

<0, (2, 4, 7)>
<0, (4, 7, 9)>
<0, (7, 8, 9)>
<4, (0, 7, 1)>
<4, (1, 7, 9)>
<4, (7, 0, 9)>
<7, (0, 4, 6)>
<7, (0, 6, 8)>
