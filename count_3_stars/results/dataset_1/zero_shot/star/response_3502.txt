Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The 3-star graphs can be identified by looking for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's find all the 3-star graphs in the given graph:

<0, (2, 9, 1)>
<1, (2, 7, 8)>
<2, (0, 1, 9)>
<3, (6, 9, 0)>

Count of 3-stars: [4]
