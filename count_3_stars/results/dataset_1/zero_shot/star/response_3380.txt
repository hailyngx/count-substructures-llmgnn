Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 3-star structures in the given graph. Here is the list of unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<0, (4, 6, 1)>
<0, (4, 6, 3)>
<1, (0, 4, 8)>
<1, (4, 0, 8)>
<2, (0, 7, 0)>
<3, (0, 6, 0)>
<4, (0, 1, 5)>
<4, (0, 5, 9)>
<5, (4, 8, 0)>
<5, (8, 4, 0)>
<6, (0, 3, 9)>
<6, (0, 4, 8)>
<7, (2, 9, 0)>
<8, (1, 5, 6)>
<8, (5, 1, 6)>
<9, (4, 6, 7)>
