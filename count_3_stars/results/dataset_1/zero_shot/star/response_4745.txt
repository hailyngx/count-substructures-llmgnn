Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are: 
<0, (4, 6, 0)>
<1, (3, 4, 6)>  
<1, (4, 9, 1)>  
<2, (7, 8, 2)>  
<4, (0, 1, 3)>  
<4, (3, 5, 7)>  
<4, (5, 7, 9)>  
<5, (4, 7, 8)>  
<7, (2, 4, 8)>  
<8, (2, 5, 6)>
