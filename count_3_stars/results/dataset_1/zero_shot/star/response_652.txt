Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be determined by first identifying all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's proceed with finding all the 3-stars in the graph:

1. The node 2 is a center of a 3-star with leaves 1, 6, and 7: <2, (1, 6, 7)>
2. The node 5 is a center of a 3-star with leaves 1, 6, and 9: <5, (1, 6, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
