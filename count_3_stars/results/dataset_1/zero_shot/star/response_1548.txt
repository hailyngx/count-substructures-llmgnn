Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<0, (4, 6, 8)>
<2, (0, 4, 5)>
<3, (1, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
