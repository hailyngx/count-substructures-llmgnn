Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 8, 9)>
<2, (5, 7, 9)>
<3, (0, 6, 9)>
<6, (1, 3, 7)>
<7, (2, 4, 6)>
<8, (0, 1, 9)>
