Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are [5] 3-stars in the given graph.  
The unique 3-stars are listed below:
<0, (4, 8, 9)>
<1, (5, 6, 9)>
<2, (3, 4, 5)>
<3, (2, 8, 9)>
<5, (1, 2, 4)>
