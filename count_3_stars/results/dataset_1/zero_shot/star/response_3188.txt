Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (2, 7, 8)>
<2, (1, 4, 5)>
<7, (1, 8, 9)>
<8, (1, 2, 5)>
<9, (7, 8, 1)>
<4, (2, 5, 4)>
