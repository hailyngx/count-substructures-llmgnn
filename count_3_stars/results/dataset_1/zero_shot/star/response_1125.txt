Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].  
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are <0, (4, 7, 8)>, <1, (2, 9, 3)>, <3, (2, 7, 9)>, and <7, (0, 4, 9)>.
