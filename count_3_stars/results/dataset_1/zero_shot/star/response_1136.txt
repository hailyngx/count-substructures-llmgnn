Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [3] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (4, 7, 8)>
<7, (0, 2, 4)>
<8, (1, 5, 9)>
