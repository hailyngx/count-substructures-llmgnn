Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The unique 3-stars in the graph are:
<0, (5, 6, 8)>
<1, (3, 6, 9)>
<2, (5, 0, 9)>
<3, (1, 9, 7)>
<4, (6, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
