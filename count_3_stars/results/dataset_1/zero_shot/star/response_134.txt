Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
The 3-stars are:
<0, (6, 9, 3)>
<1, (4, 7, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
