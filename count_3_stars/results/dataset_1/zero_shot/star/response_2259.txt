Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be calculated by finding the number of nodes that can act as the center of a 3-star. We will count each unique 3-star once and output the final result within brackets.

Let's first identify the possible 3-stars in the graph:
1. Node 1: (1, 2, 4), (1, 3, 5), (1, 5, 7), (1, 7, 9)
2. Node 3: (3, 1, 5), (3, 4, 6), (3, 5, 8), (3, 6, 8), (3, 8, 9)
3. Node 4: (4, 0, 2), (4, 2, 6), (4, 3, 8), (4, 6, 8), (4, 8, 9)
4. Node 5: (5, 0, 1), (5, 1, 3), (5, 1, 2), (5, 3, 8), (5, 8, 9)

Therefore, there are a total of 13 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Hence, the answer is [13].
