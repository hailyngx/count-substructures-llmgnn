Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The 3-stars are as follows:
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<1, (0, 2, 5)>
<2, (1, 5, 9)>
<4, (0, 2, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
