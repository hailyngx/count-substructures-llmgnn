Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
There are [8] 3-stars in the given graph. 
The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 4, 7)>
<1, (0, 6, 9)>
<2, (7, 8, -)>
<4, (0, 7, -)>
<5, (6, -, -)>
<6, (1, 5, 8)>
<7, (1, 2, 4)>
<8, (2, 6, -)>
