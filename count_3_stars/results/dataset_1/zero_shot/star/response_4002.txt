Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
The task is to count the number of 3-stars in the given graph. 

There are 3-stars centered around nodes 0, 1, 2, 5, and 6. Let's list them:

<0, (3, 7, 8)>
<1, (5, 6, 7)>
<2, (3, 6, -)>
<5, (1, 3, 6)>
<6, (1, 2, 5)>

The diamond shape formed by nodes 3, 5, 6, and 7 is excluded since it is not a 3-star.

There are a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
