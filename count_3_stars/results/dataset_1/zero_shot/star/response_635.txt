Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are:

<0, (2, 3, 6)>
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<2, (5, 7, 8)>
<7, (2, 5, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
