Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in this graph:
<0, (8, 9, -)>
<2, (9, -, -)>
<3, (4, 7, 8)>
<7, (3, 4, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
