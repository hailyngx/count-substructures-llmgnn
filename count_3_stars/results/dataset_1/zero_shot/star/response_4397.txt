Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.  
The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (7, 8, 9)>
<2, (1, 3, 7)>
<6, (3, 4, 8)>
<7, (0, 1, 2)>
