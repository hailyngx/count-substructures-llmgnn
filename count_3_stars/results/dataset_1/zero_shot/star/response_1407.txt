Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:
    1. <0, (2, 8, 1)>
    2. <1, (8, 9, 0)>
    3. <2, (0, 3, 4)>
    4. <3, (2, 6, 5)>
    5. <4, (2, 8, 7)>
    6. <5, (6, 7, 9)>
    7. <6, (3, 5, 7)>
    8. <7, (2, 5, 6)>
    9. <8, (0, 1, 4)>
    10. <9, (1, 7, 5)>

Therefore, there are 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph. [10]
