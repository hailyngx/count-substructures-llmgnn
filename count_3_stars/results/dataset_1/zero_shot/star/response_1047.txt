Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 2) 

Response:
There are 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

The 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 6, 8)>
<1, (2, 5, 7)>

Therefore, the final answer is [2].
