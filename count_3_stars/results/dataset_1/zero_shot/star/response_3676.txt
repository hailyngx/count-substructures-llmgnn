Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) 

Response:
There are 4 three-star subgraphs in the given graph. The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<1, (0, 2, 6)>
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<3, (0, 2, 4)>

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
