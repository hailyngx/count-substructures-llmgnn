Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are `[6]` 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<1, (4, 7, 8)>
<2, (3, 6, 8)>
<3, (0, 2, 6)>
<7, (1, 6, 9)>
<8, (0, 1, 7)>
