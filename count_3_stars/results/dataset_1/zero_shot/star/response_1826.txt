Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (8, 4) (9, 3) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (3, 6, 9)>
<1, (4, 8, 1)>
<2, (5, 6, 0)>
<3, (0, 9, 6)>
<4, (1, 8, 4)>
<5, (2, 6, 0)>
<6, (0, 5, 3)>
