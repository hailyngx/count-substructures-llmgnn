Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 1) (8, 1) (9, 1) 

Response:
The graph has the following 3-stars:
[<0, (2, 4, 5)>, <1, (7, 8, 9)>]  

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
