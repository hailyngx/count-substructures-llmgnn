Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-star graphs in the given graph can be found by counting the occurrences of nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify them:

Nodes connected to 3 other nodes:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 7, and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 3, 7, and 8.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 8, and has no other connection.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 7.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 7.

Therefore, there are 4 unique 3-star graphs in the given graph:
