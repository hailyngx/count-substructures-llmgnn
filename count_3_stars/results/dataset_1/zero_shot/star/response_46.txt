Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are listed inside <>:

<0, (4, 8, 1)>
<1, (2, 8, 4)>
<2, (1, 8, 7)>
<3, (6, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
