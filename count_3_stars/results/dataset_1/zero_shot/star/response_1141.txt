Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 different 3-stars in the given graph. The unique 3-stars are as follows:
<0, (1, 2, 6)>
<3, (4, 5, 6)>
<4, (1, 3, 6)>
<8, (3, 5, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
