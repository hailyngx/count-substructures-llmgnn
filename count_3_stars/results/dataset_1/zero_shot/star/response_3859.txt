Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of 3-star subgraphs in the given graph can be counted by examining each node as a potential center of a 3-star and checking its connections with three other nodes. 

Counting them manually gives:

- Node 0: (0, 5, 8)
- Node 1: (1, 5, 8)
- Node 2: (2, 3, 4)
- Node 3: (3, 2, 6)
- Node 4: (4, 2, 8)
- Node 5: (5, 0, 1)
- Node 6: (6, 3, 5)
- Node 7: (7, 1, None)
- Node 8: (8, 2, 4)
- Node 9: (9, 8, None)

Therefore, there are 8 unique 3-stars in the given graph: 
<0, (5, 8, 1)>, <1, (5, 8, 0)>, <2, (3, 4, 8)>, <3, (2, 6, 5)>, <4, (2, 8, None)>, <6, (3, 5, 8)>, <7, (1, None, None)>, <9, (8, None, None)> 

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
