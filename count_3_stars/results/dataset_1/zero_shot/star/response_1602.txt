Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph.  
The unique 3-stars are <0, (1, 2, 7)>, <1, (0, 2, 4)>, <2, (0, 1, 3)>, <3, (0, 2, 4)>, <4, (1, 3, 8)>, and <6, (1, 4, 5)>.
