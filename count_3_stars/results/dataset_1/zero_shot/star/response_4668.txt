Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:
   - <0, (3, 5, 9)>
   - <1, (3, 6, 9)>
   - <2, (3, 7, 4)>
   - <3, (0, 1, 2)>
   - <4, (3, 7, 8)>
   - <5, (0, 7, 8)>
   - <6, (1, 3, 9)>
   - <7, (2, 4, 5)>
   - <8, (3, 5, 9)>
   - <9, (0, 1, 8)>
These are 9 unique 3-stars in the graph. So the answer is [9].
