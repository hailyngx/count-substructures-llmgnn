Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
There are 3-stars present in this graph. Here is the list of unique 3-stars found:

<1, (2, 3, 6)>
<2, (1, 3, 5)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<6, (1, 2, 3)> 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
