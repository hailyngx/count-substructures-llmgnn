Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are 3-star structures in the given graph. The number of 3-stars is [3].
    
The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 6, 8)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<6, (0, 3, 7)>
