Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are [8] unique 3-stars in the given graph.  

These 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 3, 5)>
<0, (2, 5, 6)>
<2, (0, 1, 9)>
<2, (0, 5, 7)>
<2, (1, 5, 9)>
<2, (3, 7, 9)>
<4, (6, 7, 9)>
<7, (2, 4, 8)>
