Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph can be written as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 7
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 5
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 8
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 2 and 7
- Node 4 is connected to node 6
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 6
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 8
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0 and 3
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 6, and 9
- Node 9 is connected to node 8

To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify the unique 3-stars.
By observing the graph, we find that there are 4 unique 3-stars, each represented by:
- <0, (1, 5, 7)>
- <1, (0, 2, 5)>
- <2, (1, 3, 8)>
- <6, (4, 5, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
