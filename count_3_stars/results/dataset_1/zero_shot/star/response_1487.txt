Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The central nodes in a 3-star graph must have degree 3. Let's find all the 3-star structures in the given graph using this rule.

Given graph:
- Node 0 has degree 3 (connected to nodes 1, 4, and 5).
- Node 1 has degree 7.
- Node 2 has degree 3 (connected to nodes 6, 7, and 8).
- Node 3 has degree 4.
- Node 4 has degree 4.
- Node 5 has degree 5.
- Node 6 has degree 3 (connected to nodes 1, 2, and 8).
- Node 7 has degree 5.
- Node 8 has degree 7.
- Node 9 has degree 4.

So, in this graph, there are three 3-star structures:
1. <0, (1, 4, 5)>
2. <2, (6, 7, 8)>
3. <6, (1, 2, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-star structures in the graph is [3].
