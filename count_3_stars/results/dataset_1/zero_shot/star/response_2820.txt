Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:
[<0, (1, 7, 9)>, <1, (0, 3, 4)>, <2, (3, 7, 9)>, <3, (1, 2, 6)>, <4, (1, 5, -)>, <5, (4, 7, 8)>, <6, (3, -, -)>, <7, (0, 2, 5)>, <8, (5, 9, -)>, <9, (1, 2, 8)>]
Therefore, there are a total of [10] 3-stars in the graph.
