Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph. The unique 3-stars are <0, (1, 4, 9)>, <2, (3, 7, 8)>, <3, (2, 6, 8)>, and <6, (8, 9, 3)>.
