Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be calculated by examining each node as the potential center of a 3-star. 

1. For node 0:
   - <0, (1, 2, 4)>
   - <0, (1, 4, 7)>

2. For node 1:
   - <1, (0, 2, 5)>
   - <1, (0, 5, 6)>

3. For node 2:
   - <2, (0, 1, 4)>
   - <2, (1, 4, 6)>
   - <2, (0, 4, 6)>

4. For node 4:
   - <4, (0, 2, 6)>
   - <4, (2, 6, 8)>

5. For node 5:
   - <5, (1, 6, 8)>

6. For node 6:
   - <6, (1, 2, 4)>
   - <6, (1, 4, 8)>
   - <6, (1, 5, 8)>
   - <6, (2, 4, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [11].
