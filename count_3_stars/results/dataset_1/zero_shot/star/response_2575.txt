Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are 3-star subgraphs in the given graph. 

The 3-star subgraphs are:
<1, (3, 8, 2)>
<2, (3, 7, 9)>
<3, (1, 2, 5)>
<4, (6, 9, 4)>
<7, (2, 8, 7)>
<8, (1, 7, 3)>
<9, (2, 4, 9)>

Therefore, there are a total of [7] 3-stars in the given graph.
