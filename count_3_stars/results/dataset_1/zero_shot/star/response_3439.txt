Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph contains the following 3-stars:
- <0, (1, 2, 6)>
- <1, (0, 3, 5)>
- <2, (0, 7, -)>
- <3, (1, 7, -)>
- <4, (9, -, -)>
- <5, (1, -, -)>
- <6, (0, -, -)>
- <7, (2, 3, 8)>
- <8, (7, 9, -)>
- <9, (0, 4, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
