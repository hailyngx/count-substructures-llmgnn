Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 6, 7)>
<1, (2, 5, 8)>
<2, (0, 1, 9)>
<3, (5, 6, 9)>
<5, (1, 3, 6)>
<6, (0, 2, 3)>
<9, (2, 3, 7)>
