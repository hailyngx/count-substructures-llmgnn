Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:
- <0, (5, 8, 1)>
- <1, (3, 5, 7)>
- <2, (4, 5, 9)>
- <3, (1, 8, -)>
- <4, (2, 5, -)>
- <5, (0, 1, 2)>
- <6, (5, 8, -)>
- <7, (1, -,-)>
- <8, (0, 5, 6)>
- <9, (2, -, -)>

Count = [9]
