Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in this graph:

<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<1, (0, 5, 7)>
<1, (0, 8, 9)>
<3, (0, 2, 5)>
<3, (2, 6, 9)>
<6, (4, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
