Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are two 3-star structures in this graph. Here they are:

<0, (1, 3, 6)>
<2, (1, 5, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
