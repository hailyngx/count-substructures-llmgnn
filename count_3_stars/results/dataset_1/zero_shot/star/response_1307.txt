Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:
- <0, (2, 7, 9)>
- <1, (3, 4, 8)>
- <2, (0, 5, 7)>
- <3, (1, 8, 4)>
- <4, (1, 5, 8)>
- <5, (4, 6, 8)>
- <6, (5, 7, -)>
- <7, (0, 5, 9)>
- <8, (3, 4, 5)>
- <9, (0, 7, -)>

Therefore, there are 9 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The final answer is [9].
