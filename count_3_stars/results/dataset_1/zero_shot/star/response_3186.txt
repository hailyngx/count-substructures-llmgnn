Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are a total of 4 3-stars in the given graph. Here are the unique 3-stars found:
  
   - <0, (1, 4, 5)>
   - <1, (0, 4, 5)>
   - <9, (0, 1, 7)>
   - <6, (2, 3, 9)>

Therefore, the answer is [4].
