Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (5, 7, 8)>
<0, (5, 7, 9)>
<0, (7, 4, 5)>
<1, (2, 6, 9)>
<2, (1, 6, 9)>
<6, (1, 2, 3)>
