Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 4, 6)>
<3, (0, 2, 4)>
<4, (0, 1, 3)>
<6, (0, 2, 4)>
<7, (6, 9, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 4)>
