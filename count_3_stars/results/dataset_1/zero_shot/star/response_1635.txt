Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
The center node of a 3-star must have exactly 3 neighbors. In the given graph, there are 10 nodes, but only nodes 0, 1, and 6 have 3 neighbors. 

1. <0, (1, 2, 7)>
2. <1, (0, 3, 4)>
3. <6, (2, 3, 4)>

Therefore, there are a total of [3] 3-stars in the given graph.
