Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:
[<1, (2, 7, 9)>, <3, (5, 8, 4)>, <4, (5, 6, 8)>, <6, (4, 7, 9)>, <7, (1, 6, 9)>, <8, (3, 5, 9)>]
There are a total of [6] 3-stars in the graph.
