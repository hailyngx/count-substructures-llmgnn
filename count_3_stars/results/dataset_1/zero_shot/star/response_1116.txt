Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph contains the following 3-stars:
<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<3, (5, 7, 0)>
<4, (0, 1, 6)>
<5, (0, 3, 6)>
<6, (0, 4, 5)>
<7, (3, 5, 0)>
<8, (6, 9, 0)>
<9, (4, 8, 0)>

There are a total of [9] 3-stars in the graph.
