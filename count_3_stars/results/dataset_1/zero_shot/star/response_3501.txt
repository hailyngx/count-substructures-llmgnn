Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here are the 3-stars found:

1. <0, (3, 4, 7)>
2. <3, (0, 2, 4)>
3. <4, (0, 3, 7)>
4. <7, (0, 3, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
