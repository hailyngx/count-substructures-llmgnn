Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
In this graph, there are a total of [7] 3-stars.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (6, 7, 4)>
<3, (6, 8, 9)>
<4, (5, 6, 7)>
<5, (1, 4, 8)>
<6, (0, 3, 4)>
<7, (0, 4, 6)>
<9, (2, 5, 6)>
