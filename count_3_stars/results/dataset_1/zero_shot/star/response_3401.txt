Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are:
<1, (8, 9, -)>
<2, (5, 6, 7)>
<3, (5, 6, 7)>
<5, (2, 3, 6)>

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
