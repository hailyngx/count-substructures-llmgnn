Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [5] 3-stars in this graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 5, 8)>
<1, (4, 6, 7)>
<2, (0, 3, 7)>
<3, (2, 4, 5)>
<4, (1, 6, 9)>
