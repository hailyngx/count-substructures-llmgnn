Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 4) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are a total of 4 unique 3-star configurations in the given graph. The list of 3-stars is as follows:

<0, (9, 5, 7)>
<1, (4, 3, 5)>
<3, (4, 6, 7)>
<4, (1, 3, 5)>

So, the final answer is [4].
