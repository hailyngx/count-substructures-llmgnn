Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:
- <0, (6, 7, 9)>
- <1, (3, 6, 8)>
- <3, (1, 6, 7)>
- <4, (5, 6, 8)>
- <5, (4, 9, )>
- <6, (0, 1, 3)>
- <7, (0, 2, 9)>
- <8, (1, 4, 9)>
- <9, (0, 5, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
