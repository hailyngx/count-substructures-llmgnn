Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

        0 -- 2
       / \   | \
      5   6--1 8
              /| \
             3 7 9

    From the given edges, we can identify the 3-star networks as follows:
    <0, (2, 5, 6)>
    <1, (2, 3, 8)>
    <2, (0, 1, 3)>
    <6, (0, 1, 5)>
    <8, (1, 2, 7)>

    There are a total of 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Hence, the answer is [5].
