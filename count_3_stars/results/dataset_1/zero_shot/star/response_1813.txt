Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<1, (0, 2, 5)>
<2, (1, 5, 6)>
<3, (5, 7, 8)>
<4, (0, 9, 6)>
<5, (0, 1, 3)>
