Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (4, 9, 2)>
<2, (4, 5, 6)>
<3, (4, 5, 9)>
<6, (2, 4, 5)>
