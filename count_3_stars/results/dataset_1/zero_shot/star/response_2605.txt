Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are a total of [5] unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (6, 9, 1)>
<2, (4, 7, 8)>
<4, (2, 7, 5)>
<6, (0, 1, 7)>
<8, (1, 3, 5)>
