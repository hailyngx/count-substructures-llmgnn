Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 2) 

Response:
The total number of 3-star graphs in the given graph can be calculated by counting the number of ways each node can be the center of a 3-star.

Let's analyze each node:
- Node 0: <0, (1, 2, 3)>, <0, (1, 5, 6)>, <0, (2, 0, 5)>, <0, (2, 0, 8)>, <0, (3, 0, 6)>, <0, (5, 0, 8)>
- Node 1: <1, (0, 2, 4)>
- Node 2: <2, (0, 1, 7)>, <2, (0, 7, 8)>, <2, (0, 7, 9)>
- Node 3: <3, (0, 4, 5)>, <3, (0, 5, 6)>
- Node 4: <4, (1, 3, 6)>, <4, (1, 7, 9)>
- Node 5: <5, (0, 3, 7)>, <5, (0, 7, 8)>
- Node 6: <6, (0, 4, 7)>
- Node 7: <7, (2, 4, 5)>
- Node 8: <8, (0, 2, 5)>
- Node 9: <9, (2, 4, 7)>

Counting these unique 3-stars, we find a total of [17] 3-star graphs in the given graph.
