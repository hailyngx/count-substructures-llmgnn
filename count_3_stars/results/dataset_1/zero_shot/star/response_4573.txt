Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
The given graph has 4 unique 3-stars. The count is enclosed in brackets []. 

<0, (2, 3, 6)>
<1, (2, 5, 9)>
<2, (0, 1, 4)>
<3, (0, 5, 7)> 

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
