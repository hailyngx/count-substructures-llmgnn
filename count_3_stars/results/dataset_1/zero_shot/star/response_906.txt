Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. To count the number of 3-stars, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's analyze the graph to identify the 3-stars.

Based on the definition of a 3-star graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list the possible 3-stars:

1. <0, (5, 8, _)> (Node 0 is connected to nodes 5 and 8)
2. <1, (3, 4, 8)> (Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 8)
3. <3, (1, 2, 4)> (Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 4)
4. <5, (0, 6, 7)> (Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 6, and 7)
5. <8, (0, 1, 2)> (Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 2)
6. <9, (5, 8, _)> (Node 9 is connected to nodes 5 and 8)

Counting the unique 3-stars found, we have 6 unique instances:
