Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 6) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 3 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are:

<0, (3, 7, 8)>
<3, (0, 5, 6)>
<6, (1, 2, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
