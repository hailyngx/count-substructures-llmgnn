Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are two 3-stars in the given graph. Here is the list of unique 3-stars:
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<4, (1, 2, 7)>
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
