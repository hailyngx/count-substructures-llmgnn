Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (4, 7) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:
```
    0 --- 2
     \    /
      \  /
       1
       |
       8
       |
       7
      / \
     4   6
         |
         9
```

There is only one 3-star in this graph. The count is [1].
Unique 3-star: <7, (1, 4, 6)>
