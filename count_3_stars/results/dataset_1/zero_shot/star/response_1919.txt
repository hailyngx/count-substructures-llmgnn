Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are as follows: 
<0, (2, 8, 2)>
<2, (7, 2, 8)>
<2, (8, 2, 9)>
<3, (5, 3, 7)>
<3, (6, 3, 8)>
<3, (7, 3, 8)>
