Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are a total of 4 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are listed below inside brackets []:

[4]

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are as follows:
1. <0, (2, 4, 9)>
2. <2, (0, 4, 7)>
3. <4, (0, 2, 9)>
4. <9, (0, 4, 6)>
