Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 10 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 7) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) 

Response:
There are 6 different 3-stars in the given graph. 

<[1, (3, 8)]>
<[3, (1, 8)]>
<[4, (7, 6)]>
<[6, (7, 4)]>
<[7, (4, 6)]>
<[8, (1, 3)]>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
