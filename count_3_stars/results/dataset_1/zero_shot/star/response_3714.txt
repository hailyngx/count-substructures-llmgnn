Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are two 3-stars in the given graph.  
The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<2, (1, 3, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
