Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are four 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are listed inside brackets:

[4]

And the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

<0, (1, 7, 8)>
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<2, (1, 5, 9)>
<5, (2, 6, 8)>
