Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The 3-star in this graph is as follows:
<[0, (4, 9)]>
<[1, (3, 7)]>
<[2, (4, 9)]>
<[3, (1, 7, 8)]>
<[4, (0, 2)]>
<[5, (6, 7)]>
<[6, (5, 8, 9)]>
<[7, (1, 3, 5, 9)]>
<[8, (3, 6, 9)]>
<[9, (0, 2, 6, 7, 8)]>

Therefore, there are [10] 3-star graphs in the given graph.
