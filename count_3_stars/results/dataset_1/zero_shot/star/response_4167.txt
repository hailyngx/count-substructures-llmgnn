Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
The graph contains 3-stars at the following nodes: 
- <0, (4, 6, 1)>
- <1, (2, 6, 0)>
- <2, (1, 4, 9)>
- <4, (0, 9, 2)>
- <6, (0, 1, 7)>
- <7, (6, 2, 8)>
- <8, (5, 7, 2)>
- <9, (2, 4, 0)>

Therefore, there are a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
