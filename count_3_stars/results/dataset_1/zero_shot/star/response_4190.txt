Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
The 3-stars are: 
<0, (2, 6, 8)>
<7, (6, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
