Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].

The unique 3-stars found in the given graph are:
<0, (3, 6, 7)>
<2, (4, 5, 8)>
