Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<1, (0, 2, 7)>
<2, (1, 7, 8)>
<8, (2, 7, 9)>
