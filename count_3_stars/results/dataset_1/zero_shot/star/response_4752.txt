Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in this graph. Here they are:

<0, (2, 4, 9)>
<3, (0, 5, 8)>
<4, (0, 7, 9)>
<5, (3, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
