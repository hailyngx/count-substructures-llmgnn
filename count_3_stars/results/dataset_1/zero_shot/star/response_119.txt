Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<1, (3, 4, 6)>
<6, (0, 1, 9)>
