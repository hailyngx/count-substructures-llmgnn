Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (4, 1, 9)>
<1, (4, 0, 9)>
<2, (7, 4, 9)>
<4, (0, 1, 6)>
<7, (2, 9, 4)>
<9, (1, 7, 8)>
