Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
The graph described has the following 3-stars:
[<0, (1, 2, 3)> <1, (0, 7, 9)> <2, (0, 4, 5)> <3, (0, 4, 5)> <4, (2, 3, 9)> <5, (2, 3, 8)> <7, (0, 1, 5)> <8, (4, 5, 6)> <9, (1, 4, 1)>]
Hence, there are 9 different 3-stars in total. Therefore, the final answer is [9].
