Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The graph can be visualized as follows:

```
   1 -- 8 -- 9
   |    |      |
   0    2 -- 5 -- 6 -- 7
        |       |
        4       3
```

From the given graph, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<1, (0, 8, 9)>
<2, (0, 3, 8)>
<3, (0, 2, 9)>
<5, (2, 4, 6)>
<6, (3, 5, 7)>
<8, (1, 2, 9)>
<9, (1, 3, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
