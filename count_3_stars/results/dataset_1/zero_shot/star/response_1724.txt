Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are four 3-stars in the given graph. Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

- <0, (3, 7, 4)>
- <1, (8, 5, 4)>
- <5, (8, 1, 4)>
- <7, (9, 6, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
