Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The 3-stars are:

<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<1, (2, 5, 6)>
<3, (5, 7, 9)>
<6, (0, 1, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
