Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are [2] 3-stars in the given graph.
  
The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 4, 6)>
<9, (1, 5, 6)>
