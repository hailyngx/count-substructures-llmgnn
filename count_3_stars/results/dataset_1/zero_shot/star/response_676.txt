Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are numbered from 0 to 9. The 3-stars in this graph can be identified by finding nodes that are connected to exactly 3 other nodes. Let's list them:

<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<1, (0, 3, 9)>
<2, (0, 4, 6)>
<3, (1, 9, 7)>
<4, (0, 6, 8)>
<5, (9, 7, -)>
<6, (4, 2, -)>
<7, (9, 3, -)>
<8, (4, 0, -)>
<9, (1, 3, 5)>

Counting unique 3-stars, we have a total of [10].
