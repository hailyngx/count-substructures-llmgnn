Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 5, 7, and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to node 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 6, 7, and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 5 and 6.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 8, and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 7, and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 6, and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 5 and 7.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 5, and 6.

To find the 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify the central nodes and their connected leaves. Since a 3-star involves one central node and three leaves, we can identify the unique 3-stars as follows:

<0, (5, 7, 9)>
<2, (6, 7, 9)>
<4, (5, 6, 9)>
<5, (0, 4, 9)>
<6, (2, 4, 9)>
<7, (0, 2, 8)>
<9, (0, 1, 5)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we have a total of [7] 3-stars in the given graph.
