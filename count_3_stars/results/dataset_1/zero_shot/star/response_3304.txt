Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are three 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<1, (0, 4, 7)>
<2, (4, 5, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
