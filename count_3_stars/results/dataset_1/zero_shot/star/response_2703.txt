Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The answer is [6].
    
    <0, (2, 4, 7)>
    <0, (2, 4, 9)>
    <4, (3, 5, 6)>
    <4, (3, 5, 8)>
    <3, (4, 7, 8)>
    <5, (3, 7, 8)>
