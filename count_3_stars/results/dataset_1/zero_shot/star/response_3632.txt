Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There is a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 4, 8)>
<1, (6, 9, 2)>
<2, (0, 4, 5)>
<3, (4, 5, 6)>
<4, (0, 2, 3)>
<9, (1, 6, 8)>
