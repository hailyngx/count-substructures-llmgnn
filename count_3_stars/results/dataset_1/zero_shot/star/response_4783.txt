Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are four 3-star subgraphs in this graph. Here are the unique 3-stars:
<0, (3, 6, 8)>
<3, (0, 2, 6)>
<4, (6, 7, 8)>
<6, (0, 1, 3)>

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
