Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are:

1. <0, (3, 8, 1)>
2. <1, (4, 0, 7)>
3. <2, (5, 9, 0)>
4. <4, (9, 1, 7)>
5. <7, (9, 1, 4)>
6. <9, (2, 4, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
