Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (5, 7, 8)>
<0, (7, 8, 9)>
<1, (4, 6, 5)>
<3, (2, 7, 8)>
<4, (1, 5, 7)>
