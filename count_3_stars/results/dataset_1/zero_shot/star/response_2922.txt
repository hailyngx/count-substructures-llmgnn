Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found in the given graph are:
<0, (5, 8, 1)>
<1, (3, 4, 7)>
