Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of 4 three-star (3-star) structures in the given graph. 

The unique 3-star structures are:
<1, (6, 8, 9)>
<3, (5, 6, 9)>
<4, (9, 7, 8)>
<6, (0, 1, 2)>

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
