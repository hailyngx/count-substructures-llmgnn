Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
The graph contains the following 3-stars:
[<0, (1, 7, 4)>, <2, (5, 9, 6)>, <4, (5, 7, 6)>, <5, (2, 4, 6)>, <6, (5, 7, 8)>]

There are a total of 5 unique 3-stars in this graph.
