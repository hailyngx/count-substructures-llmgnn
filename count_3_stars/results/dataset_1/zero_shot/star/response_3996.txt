Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (2, 5, 7)>
<1, (5, 6, 8)>
<2, (0, 4, 6)>
<2, (5, 6, 9)>
<6, (1, 2, 9)>
<9, (5, 6, 8)>
