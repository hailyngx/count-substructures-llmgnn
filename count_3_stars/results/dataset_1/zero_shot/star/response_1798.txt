Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph contains the following 3-star structures:

[<0, (1, 2, 6)>, <1, (0, 3, 4)>, <2, (0, 7, 8)>, <3, (1, 6, 8)>, <4, (1, 5, 8)>, <5, (1, 4, 8)>, <6, (0, 3, 9)>, <7, (2, 8, 0)>, <8, (0, 3, 5)>, <9, (0, 6, 0)>]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
