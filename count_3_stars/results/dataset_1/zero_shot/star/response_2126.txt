Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (3, 4, 8)>
<1, (3, 8, 0)>
<2, (4, 7, 8)>
<5, (6, 7, 8)>
<3, (0, 1, 4)>
<4, (0, 2, 7)>
