Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (4, 5, 9)>
<1, (2, 3, 7)>
