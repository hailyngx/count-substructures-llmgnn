Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.  
The unique 3-stars are:  
<0, (7, 9)>  
<1, (2, 5, 4)>  
<2, (1, 5, 6)>  
<4, (1, 5, 6)>
