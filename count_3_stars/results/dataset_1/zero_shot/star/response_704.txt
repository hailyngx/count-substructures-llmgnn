Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.  

Below are the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (7, 9, 0)>
<2, (8, 9, 2)>
<3, (4, 9, 3)>
<9, (0, 8, 7)>
