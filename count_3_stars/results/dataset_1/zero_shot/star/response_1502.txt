Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph. The unique 3-stars are <0, (1, 2, 7)>, <1, (0, 2, 6)>, <2, (0, 1, 8)>, and <7, (0, 5, 9)>.
