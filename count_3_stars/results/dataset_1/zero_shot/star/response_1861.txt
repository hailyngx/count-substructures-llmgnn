Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:
[<0, (3, 6, 9)>, <2, (3, 4, 8)>, <4, (2, 5, 8)>, <8, (2, 9, 4)>, <9, (0, 8, 0)>]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
