Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) 

Response:
There is a total of [3] 3-star(s) in the given graph.  

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (5, 6, 7)>
<1, (2, 3, 8)>
<8, (1, 3, 5)>
