Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are a total of 3-stars in the given graph. Here is the count and the list of unique 3-stars:

[<1, (3, 6, 7)>, <3, (1, 2, 6)>, <3, (6, 8, 9)>]
