Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph can be counted by looking for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

[<2, (0, 5, 6)>, <3, (4, 5, 8)>, <7, (4, 6, 9)>]

Therefore, the final answer is [3].
