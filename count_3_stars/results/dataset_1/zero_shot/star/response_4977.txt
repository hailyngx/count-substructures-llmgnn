Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 3 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here is the list of unique 3-stars:
   <7, (1, 2, 8)>
   <2, (7, 8, 9)>
   <6, (3, 9, 7)>
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
