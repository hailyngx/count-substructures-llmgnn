Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be determined by counting the number of times each node appears as the center node in the graph. Let's go ahead and count the number of 3-stars:

1. Node 0: (0, 3, 5), (0, 3, 6)
2. Node 1: (1, 2, 4)
3. Node 2: (2, 1, 6), (2, 1, 7), (2, 4, 9)
4. Node 3: (3, 0, 4), (3, 0, 7), (3, 4, 8)
5. Node 4: (4, 1, 8), (4, 3, 9)
6. Node 5: (5, 0, -)
7. Node 6: (6, 0, 2)
8. Node 7: (7, 2, 3)
9. Node 8: (8, 3, 4)
10. Node 9: (9, 2, 4)

Therefore, there are a total of 11 unique 3-stars. The 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 5, 6)>, <1, (2, 4, -)>, <2, (1, 6, 7)>, <2, (1, 4, 9)>, <3, (0, 4, 7)>, <3, (0, 4, 8)>, <4, (1, 8, -)>, <4, (3, 9, -)>, <5, (0, -, -)>, <6, (0, 2, -)>, <7, (2, 3, -)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [11].
