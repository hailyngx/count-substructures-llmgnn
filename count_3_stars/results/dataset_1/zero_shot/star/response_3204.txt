Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph consists of the following 3-stars:
<0, (2, 4, 8)>, 
<1, (3, 8, 9)>, 
<2, (3, 4, 5)>, 
<3, (1, 2, 4)>, 
<4, (2, 3, 8)>, and 
<5, (2, 4, 9)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [6].
