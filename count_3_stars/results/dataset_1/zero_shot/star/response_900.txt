Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:
[<0, (2, 4, 5)>, <1, (5, 7, 8)>, <2, (0, 7, 8)>, <3, (5, 8, 9)>]

Therefore, the total count of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
