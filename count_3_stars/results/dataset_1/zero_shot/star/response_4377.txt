Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 2) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph can be found by counting the possible combinations of a central node and 3 leaves. 

To find the number of 3-stars, we can start by identifying all nodes with exactly 3 neighbors. These nodes can be potential central nodes in a 3-star. 

Nodes with 3 neighbors: 0, 2, 5, 9

For each of these central nodes, we can find the combinations of 3 other nodes that are connected to the central node. 

For node 0:
(0, 1, 4, 8)
<0, (1, 4, 8)>

For node 2:
(2, 0, 5, 8)
<2, (0, 5, 8)>

For node 5:
(5, 2, 3)
<5, (2, 3, X)>, where X can be any node except nodes 2 and 5 as they are already connected.

For node 9:
(9, 2, X)
<9, (2, X, Y)>, where X and Y can be any nodes except nodes 2 and 9.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
