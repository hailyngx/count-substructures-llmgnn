Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 3-star structures in this graph. Let's list them:

<1, (3, 4, 7)>
<2, (3, 4, 7)>
<3, (1, 2, 7)>
<4, (1, 2, 6)>
<7, (1, 2, 3)>
<8, (4, 7, 9)>

Count = [6]
