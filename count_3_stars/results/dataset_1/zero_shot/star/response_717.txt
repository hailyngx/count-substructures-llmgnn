Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are [8] 3-stars in the given graph. 
The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (6, 7, 8)>
<1, (6, 8, 0)>
<2, (3, 4, 5)>
<2, (7, 9, 2)>
<3, (2, 8, 9)>
<4, (2, 6, 0)>
<5, (2, 8, 0)>
<6, (0, 1, 4)>
