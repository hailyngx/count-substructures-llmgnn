Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are as follows:
[<0, (1, 3, 5)>, <1, (0, 4, 5)>, <3, (0, 2, 7)>, <4, (1, 2, 5)>, <5, (0, 1, 4)>, <8, (1, 5, 9)>, <9, (3, 8)>]
The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
