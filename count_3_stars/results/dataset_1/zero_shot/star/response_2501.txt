Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 3 3-stars in the given graph. 
So, the final answer is [3].
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (3, 6, 7)>
<2, (3, 4, 7)>
<4, (2, 5, 9)>
