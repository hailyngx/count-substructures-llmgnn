Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
The 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 7, 5)>
<2, (0, 7, 6)>
<5, (1, 2, 4)>
<6, (3, 2, 9)>

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
