Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.

<0, (5, 8, 1)>
<3, (5, 6, 8)>
<4, (2, 8, 5)>
