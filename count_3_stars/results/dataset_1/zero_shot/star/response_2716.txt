Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 6) 

Response:
The given graph contains the following 3-stars:
[<0, (1, 4, 7)>, <1, (0, 2, 7)>, <2, (1, 7, 8)>, <3, (5, 6, 7)>, <4, (0, 6, 8)>, <5, (3, 6, 7)>, <6, (3, 4, 7)>, <7, (0, 1, 2)>, <8, (2, 4, 6)>]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
