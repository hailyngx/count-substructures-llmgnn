Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [9] 3-stars in the given graph. 

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<1, (0, 2, 8)>
<2, (1, 4, 7)>
<3, (0, 5, 7)>
<4, (0, 1, 2)>
<5, (3, 8, 9)>
<6, (0, 4, 8)>
<7, (0, 2, 3)>
<9, (3, 4, 5)>
