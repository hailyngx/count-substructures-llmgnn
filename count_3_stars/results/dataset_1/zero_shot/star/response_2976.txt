Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 7, 9)>
<1, (2, 6, 8)>
<2, (0, 1, 8)>
<8, (1, 3, 6)>
So, the final answer is [4].
