Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 three-star graphs in the given graph. Here they are:

\[<0, (3, 7, 8)>\]

\[<1, (2, 3, 9)>\]

\[<3, (0, 1, 4)>\]

\[<3, (5, 6, 8)>\]

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
