Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 44 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 4 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are grouped and counted based on their central node:

- <0, (2, 4, 7)>
- <1, (2, 3, 9)>
- <2, (0, 4, 8)>
- <3, (1, 4, 8)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
