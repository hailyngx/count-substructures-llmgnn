Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are a total of 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are listed along with their central nodes and leaf nodes:
   
   <0, (3, 4, 5)>
   <1, (4, 7, 9)>
   <2, (3, 6, 9)>
   <3, (0, 2, 5)>
   <4, (0, 1, 5)>
   <7, (1, 2, 9)>
   
   Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
