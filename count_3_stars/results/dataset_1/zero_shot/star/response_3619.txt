Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be calculated by counting the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

After examining the provided edges, we can determine the following 3-stars in the graph:
- <0, (1, 5, 8)>
- <9, (0, 2, 4)>
- <7, (5, 8, 9)>

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
