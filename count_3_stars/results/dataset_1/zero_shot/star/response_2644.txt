Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
    
    Unique 3-stars:
    <0, (5, 8, 1)>
    <1, (8, 3, 2)>
    <2, (7, 1, 5)>
    <3, (7, 1, 9)>
    <5, (2, 0, 4)>
    <7, (8, 2, 3)>
    <8, (7, 1, 0)>
    <9, (3, 1, 7)>
    <4, (5, 0, 6)>
