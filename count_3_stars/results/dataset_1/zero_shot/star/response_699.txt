Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are:

<2, (6, 5, 8)>
<3, (9, 4, 0)>
<4, (7, 9, 5)>
<5, (6, 9, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
