Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are [12] 3-stars in the given graph. 

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (5, 9, 2)>
<2, (5, 6, 8)>
<6, (2, 3, 8)>
<9, (0, 1, 3)>
