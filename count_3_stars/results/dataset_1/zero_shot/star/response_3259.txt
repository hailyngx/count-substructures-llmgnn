Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of 5 unique 3-stars in this graph. 

The 3-stars are:
<0, (5, 8, 1)>
<1, (9, 7, 6)>
<3, (6, 8, 1)>
<4, (9, 7, 1)>
<9, (1, 8, 7)>

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
