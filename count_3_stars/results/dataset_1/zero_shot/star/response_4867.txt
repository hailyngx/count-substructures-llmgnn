Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 6, 2)>
<1, (0, 4, 5)>
<1, (5, 6, 7)>
<6, (0, 5, 3)>
