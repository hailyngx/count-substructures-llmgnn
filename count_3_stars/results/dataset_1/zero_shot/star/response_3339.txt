Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph, and the count is [6].  
The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<1, (6, 4, 3)>
<2, (0, 1, 4)>
<3, (1, 6, 7)>
<4, (1, 2, 0)>
<5, (0, 7, 9)>
