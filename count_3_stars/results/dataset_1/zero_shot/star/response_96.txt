Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 3-star structures present in the given graph. Here is the list of unique 3-stars: 

    <0, (2, 4, 7)>
    <4, (0, 1, 7)>
    <7, (0, 4, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
