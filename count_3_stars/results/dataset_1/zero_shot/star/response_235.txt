Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
The 3-star in this graph is formed by the following node combinations:
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<0, (4, 7, 9)>
<0, (5, 2, 9)>
<1, (0, 6, 9)>
<4, (0, 7, 8)>
<5, (0, 2, 6)>
<6, (1, 3, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
