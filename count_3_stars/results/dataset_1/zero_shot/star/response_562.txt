Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in this graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<1, (0, 6, 7)>
<3, (0, 5, 8)>
<6, (0, 1, 8)>
