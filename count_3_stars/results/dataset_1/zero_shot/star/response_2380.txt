Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are [3] 3-stars in the given graph. 
The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<2, (5, 6, 9)>
<3, (1, 6, 7)>
