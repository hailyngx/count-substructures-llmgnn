Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of [3] 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 7, 8)>
<1, (4, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 1, 9)>
