Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:
[<1, (2, 5, 6)>, <3, (1, 4, 5)>, <4, (3, 5, 7)>, <5, (1, 4, 6)>, <6, (1, 5, 9)>, <9, (1, 6, 7)>]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
