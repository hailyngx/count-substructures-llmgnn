Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 4, 7)>
<3, (6, 8, 9)>
<4, (0, 1, 2)>
<4, (1, 0, 2)>
<9, (5, 8, 9)>
