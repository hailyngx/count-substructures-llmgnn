Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be calculated by determining the number of connected triples that form 3-stars.

Out of the 10 nodes in the graph, the nodes that have degree 3 can be considered as potential centers of 3-stars (since each 3-star has a central node connected to exactly 3 other nodes).

From the given edge list:
- Node 1 has degree 5.
- Node 3 has degree 4.
- Node 4 has degree 4.
- Node 5 has degree 5.
- Node 6 has degree 4.
- Node 7 has degree 4.
- Node 9 has degree 5.

Now, we identify the nodes which can act as the central node of a 3-star. These are nodes 3, 4, 6, 7. 
Next, we determine the number of 3-stars for each of these central nodes.

For node 3:
<3, (4, 5, 7)>
<3, (4, 5, 9)>

For node 4:
<4, (1, 5, 7)>
<4, (1, 5, 3)>

For node 6:
<6, (0, 1, 7)>
<6, (0, 1, 2)>

For node 7:
<7, (1, 3, 4)>
<7, (1, 3, 6)>

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
