Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here is the list of 3-stars with their central nodes and leaves:

<0, (4, 7, 8)>
<1, (3, 4, 9)>
<2, (4, 5, 6)>
<4, (0, 1, 2)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
