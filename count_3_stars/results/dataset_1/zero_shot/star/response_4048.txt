Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [4] unique 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<1, (0, 5, 9)>
<2, (0, 6, 7)>
<9, (1, 2, 7)>
