Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are as follows:
[<0, (1, 2, 8)>, <1, (0, 3, 4)>, <2, (0, 1, 6)>, <3, (1, 5, 6)>, <4, (1, 5, 6)>, <5, (1, 3, 6)>, <6, (1, 2, 3)>, <7, (6, 9, 8)>, <8, (2, 9, 0)>, <9, (6, 7, 8)>]
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
