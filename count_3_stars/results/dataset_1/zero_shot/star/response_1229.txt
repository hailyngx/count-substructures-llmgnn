Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 2) (6, 4) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be calculated by counting the number of nodes which could potentially be center nodes, and for each center node, counting the number of valid 3-stars. 
Given that a 3-star consists of a central node connected to three other nodes, we need to find all sets of three nodes that are connected to a specific central node. 

Here are the unique 3-stars in the given graph:
<2, (0, 3, 4)>
<3, (0, 2, 9)>
<4, (1, 2, 6)>
<9, (1, 2, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
