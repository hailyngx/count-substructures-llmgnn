Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in this graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (6, 9, 1)>
<2, (3, 6, 9)>
<3, (1, 2, 6)>
<4, (7, 8, 9)>
