Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) 

Response:
The given graph is:  
- Node 0 is connected to node 1.  
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7.  
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1 and 3.  
- Node 3 is connected to node 2.  
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 6, and 8.  
- Node 5 is connected to node 1.  
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 8.  
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1 and 2.   
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 4 and 6. 

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars in this graph:

There are 5 unique 3-star configurations, which are:
<1, (0, 4, 5)>
<1, (2, 6, 7)>
<1, (4, 6, 8)>
<2, (1, 3, 7)>
<4, (1, 6, 8)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [5].
