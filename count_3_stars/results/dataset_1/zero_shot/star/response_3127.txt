Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are:

<0, (4, 5, 8)>
<1, (2, 4, 9)>

Therefore, the final answer is [2].
