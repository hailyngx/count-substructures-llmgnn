Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [2] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 6, 9)>
<6, (0, 7, 9)>
