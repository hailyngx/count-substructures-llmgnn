Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:
\[<0, (2, 4, 5)> \quad <0, (4, 5, 7)> \quad <0, (5, 1, 3)> \quad <0, (5, 4, 7)> \quad <0, (5, 7, 4)> \quad <0, (5, 7, 8)> \quad <0, (5, 8, 2)> \quad <0, (5, 8, 3)> \quad <0, (5, 8, 9)>\]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
