Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of 3-star subgraphs in this given graph is [1].

The unique 3-star found in the graph is <7, (0, 1, 2)>.
