Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
The 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 4, 7)>
<1, (0, 7, 9)>
<2, (8, 9, 3)>
<3, (5, 8, 2)>
<4, (0, 7, 8)>
<5, (3, 8, 0)>
