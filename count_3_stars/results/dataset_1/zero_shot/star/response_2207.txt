Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (4, 8, 2)>
<4, (0, 9, 3)>
<6, (1, 9, 7)>
