Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be found by identifying the central node for each 3-star in the graph and counting how many leaves are connected to each central node. 

Based on the given graph, the 3-stars are as follows:
<0, (3, 6, 9)>
<1, (2, 4, 5)>
<2, (1, 4, 9)>
<3, (0, 4, 6)>
<4, (1, 2, 3)>
<5, (1, 6, 7)>
<6, (0, 4, 5)>
<7, (1, 5, 6)>
<8, (5, 6, 7)>
<9, (0, 1, 4)>

Therefore, there are a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
