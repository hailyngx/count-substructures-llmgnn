Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph consists of the following 3-stars:

[<0, (3, 7, 8)>, <1, (5, 7, -)>, <2, (3, -, -)>, <4, (6, 7, 8)>, <5, (1, 6, -)>, <9, (8, -, -)>]

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
