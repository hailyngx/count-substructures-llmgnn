Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are a total of [4] 3-stars in this graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 5, 7)>
<0, (4, 1, 9)>
<3, (2, 4, 5)>
<4, (0, 1, 8)>
