Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<3, (0, 8, 6)>
<4, (5, 6, 7)>
<5, (0, 4, 7)>
