Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The number of 3-star graphs in the given graph can be calculated by finding all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go ahead and list all the 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (2, 5, 6)>
<2, (0, 1, 5)>
<3, (2, 8, 9)>
<4, (1, 5, 8)>
<5, (0, 2, 4)>
<8, (1, 3, 5)>
<9, (3, 5, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [(7)].
