Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in this graph. Here they are:

<0, (2, 4, 8)>
<0, (2, 8, 9)>
<2, (0, 4, 8)>
<2, (4, 7, 9)>
<4, (0, 2, 8)>
<8, (0, 2, 7)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
