Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
The 3-stars are as follows: 
<0, (6, 9, 1)>
<1, (6, 4, 7)>
<3, (6, 5, 8)>
<4, (1, 7, 8)>
<5, (3, 9, 8)>
<6, (0, 1, 3)>
