Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The center of a 3-star can be any node in the graph. Let's iterate through each node and count the number of 3-stars with that node as the center.

1. Nodes and their corresponding 3-stars:
   - Node 0: <0, (2, 7, 8)>, <0, (7, 0, 9)>, <0, (8, 0, 9)>
   - Node 1: <1, (9, 0, 2)>
   - Node 2: <2, (0, 4, 7)>, <2, (0, 7, 8)>, <2, (4, 2, 7)>, <2, (4, 3, 7)>, <2, (2, 0, 8)>
   - Node 3: <3, (4, 7, 9)>, <3, (4, 7, 9)>
   - Node 4: <4, (2, 3, 7)>, <4, (2, 7, 8)>, <4, (3, 4, 7)>, <4, (3, 7, 9)>, <4, (7, 4, 9)>
   - Node 5: None
   - Node 6: None
   - Node 7: <7, (0, 2, 3)>, <7, (0, 3, 4)>, <7, (2, 0, 4)>, <7, (2, 4, 3)>, <7, (3, 4, 9)>, <7, (0, 4, 9)>
   - Node 8: None
   - Node 9: <9, (0, 1, 3)>, <9, (0, 3, 4)>, <9, (1, 0, 9)>, <9, (3, 4, 7)>, <9, (0, 4, 7)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we find that there are 16 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the final answer is [16].
