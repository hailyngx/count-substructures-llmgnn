Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 3) (6, 3) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 2) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph. Here are the unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 4, 8)>
<1, (0, 3, 5)>
<2, (3, 7, 8)>
<3, (1, 2, 4)>
