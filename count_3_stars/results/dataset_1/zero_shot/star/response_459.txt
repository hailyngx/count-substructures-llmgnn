Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].

The 3-stars in the graph are:
<0, (2, 6, 9)>
<1, (2, 4, 0)>
<2, (0, 6, 1)>
<4, (1, 6, 9)>
<6, (0, 2, 4)>
<9, (0, 4, 8)>
<5, (9, 8, 0)>
<7, (2, 6, 0)>
