Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<1, (0, 3, 9)>
<2, (6, 8, 9)>
<3, (0, 1, 9)>
<4, (5, 6, 9)>
<5, (0, 4, 9)>
<6, (2, 4, 9)>
<9, (1, 3, 5)>
