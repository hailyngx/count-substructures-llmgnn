Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are two 3-stars in the given graph. 
Therefore, the answer is [2]. 
The unique 3-stars found are <0, (1, 2, 3)> and <0, (4, 6, 9)>.
