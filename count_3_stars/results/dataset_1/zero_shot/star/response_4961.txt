Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 9) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph.  
The unique 3-stars are:  
<0, (3, 9, 1)>  
<3, (0, 7, 9)>  
<7, (3, 6, 9)>  
<9, (0, 1, 3)>  
<1, (2, 9, 0)>  
<2, (1, 9, 9)>
