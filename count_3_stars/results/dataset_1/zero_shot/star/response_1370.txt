Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of 3-star graphs can be found by counting all possible combinations of nodes where one node is connected to exactly three other nodes in the graph. 

In this given graph, the nodes with degrees as follows:
- Node 0: degree 3
- Node 1: degree 2
- Node 2: degree 1
- Node 3: degree 3
- Node 4: degree 1
- Node 5: degree 1
- Node 7: degree 1
- Node 8: degree 4
- Node 9: degree 2

Therefore, the 3-star graphs in this given graph are as follows:
- <0, (2, 8, 9)>
- <3, (1, 5, 8)>
- <8, (0, 1, 3)>
- <9, (0, 7, 8)>

Thus, there are a total of [4] 3-star graphs in the given graph.
