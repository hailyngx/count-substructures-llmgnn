Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [3] 3-stars in the given graph.
  
The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<4, (0, 8, 9)>
<7, (2, 5, 6)>
