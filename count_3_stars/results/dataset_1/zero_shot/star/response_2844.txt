Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 6 3-stars in the given graph. The unique 3-stars are:

<0, (1, 4, 9)>
<1, (0, 5, 9)>
<2, (8, 9, 3)>
<3, (5, 6, 9)>
<4, (0, 6, 9)>
<6, (3, 4, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [6].
