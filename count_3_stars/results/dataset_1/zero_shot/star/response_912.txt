Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<1, (0, 5, 6)>
<5, (1, 6, 7)>
<6, (0, 1, 7)>
<7, (5, 6, 8)>
<8, (2, 7, 8)>
