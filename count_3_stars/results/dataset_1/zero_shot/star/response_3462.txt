Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph. 

<0, (3, 5, 1)>
<3, (0, 8, 1)>
<5, (0, 1, 6)>
<8, (2, 3, 6)>
<7, (4, 9, 8)>
<9, (4, 5, 8)>
