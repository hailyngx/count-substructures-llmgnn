Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:

[<0, (1, 2, 4)>, <1, (0, 5, 6)>, <1, (5, 6, 7)>, <2, (0, 5, 9)>, <3, (5, 6, 9)>, <7, (1, 6, 8)>, <7, (6, 8, 9)>, <9, (2, 3, 7)>]

Therefore, there are 8 unique 3-stars in the graph. The final answer is [8].
