Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are two 3-stars in the given graph based on the definition provided. Here they are:

<0, (2, 6, 2)>
<1, (3, 4, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
