Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the graph.  

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 7, 9)>
<1, (3, 6, 7)>
<2, (0, 7, 9)>
<7, (0, 1, 2)>
