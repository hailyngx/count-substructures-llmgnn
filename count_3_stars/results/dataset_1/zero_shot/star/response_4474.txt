Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:
[<0, (1, 8, 9)>, <2, (5, 9, 8)>, <4, (1, 0, 9)>]
