Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be calculated by examining each node as a potential center node and counting the number of 3-stars formed around it. Let's go through this process:

1. For node 0:
    - (0, 2), (0, 5), (0, 8) forms a 3-star: <0, (2, 5, 8)>

2. For node 1:
    - (1, 2), (1, 5), (1, 8) forms a 3-star: <1, (2, 5, 8)>
    - (1, 9) is not part of any 3-star.

3. For node 2:
    - (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4) forms a 3-star: <2, (0, 1, 4)>
    - (2, 7) is not part of any 3-star.

4. For node 3:
    - (3, 4), (3, 7) are not part of any 3-star.

5. For node 4:
    - (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5) forms a 3-star: <4, (2, 3, 5)>
    - (4, 6) is not part of any 3-star.

6. For node 5:
    - (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 4) forms a 3-star: <5, (0, 1, 4)>
    - (5, 6) is not part of any 3-star.
    - (5, 7) forms a 3-star: <5, (6, 7, 9)>
    - (5, 9) is not part of any 3-star.

7. For node 6:
    - (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 8) forms a 3-star: <6, (4, 5, 8)>
    - (6, 9) is not part of any 3-star.

8. For node 7:
    - (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 5) forms a 3-star: <7, (2, 3, 5)>
    - (7, 8) is not part of any 3-star.

9. For node 8:
    - (8, 0), (8, 1), (8, 6) forms a 3-star: <8, (0, 1, 6)>
    - (8, 7) is not part of any 3-star.

10. For node 9:
    - (9, 1), (9, 5), (9, 6) forms a 3-star: <9, (1, 5, 6)>

Therefore, the 3-stars in the given graph are: <<0, (2, 5, 8)>, <1, (2, 5, 8)>, <2, (0, 1, 4)>, <4, (2, 3, 5)>, <5, (0, 1, 4)>, <5, (6, 7, 9)>, <6, (4, 5, 8)>, <7, (2, 3, 5)>, <8, (0, 1, 6)>, <9, (1, 5, 6)>>. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
