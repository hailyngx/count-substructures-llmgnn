Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [4] unique 3-stars in the given graph.

The 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 3, 6)>
<1, (4, 6, 8)>
<3, (0, 6, 8)>
<8, (1, 6, 9)>
