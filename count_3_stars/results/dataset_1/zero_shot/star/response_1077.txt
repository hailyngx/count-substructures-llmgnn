Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 5, 7)>
<2, (1, 4, 5)>
<3, (0, 4, 5)>
<4, (2, 3, 5)>
<5, (0, 2, 3)>
<9, (0, 2, 6)>
