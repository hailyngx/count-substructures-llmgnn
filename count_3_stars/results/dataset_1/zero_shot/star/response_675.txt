Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<1, (0, 3, 6)>
<2, (0, 5, 7)>
<6, (1, 2, 7)>
