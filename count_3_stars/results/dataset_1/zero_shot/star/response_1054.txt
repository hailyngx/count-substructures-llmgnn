Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [8].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<1, (0, 4, 9)>
<2, (0, 4, 6)>
<4, (1, 2, 7)>
<6, (2, 8, 9)>
<8, (5, 6, 8)>
<9, (1, 6, 9)>
<7, (4, 6, 7)>
