Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (7, 9, 0)>
<1, (3, 4, 6)>
<1, (4, 1, 8)>
<1, (6, 1, 2)>
<1, (8, 1, 3)>
<2, (4, 6, 8)>
<2, (6, 2, 8)>
<3, (1, 5, 7)>
