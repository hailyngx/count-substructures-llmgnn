Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 3-stars in this graph. The count is [7].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 5, 6)>
<1, (8, 9, 4)>
<2, (0, 3, 8)>
<3, (2, 7, 0)>
<4, (8, 9, 7)>
<5, (0, 6, 2)>
<9, (1, 7, 4)>
