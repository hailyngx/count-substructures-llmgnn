Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:
<0, (4, 6, 9)>
<1, (6, 7, 9)>
<2, (3, 4, 5)>
<6, (0, 1, 7)>
<9, (0, 1, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
