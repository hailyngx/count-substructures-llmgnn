Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (9, 0) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The answer is [4].

The unique 3-stars are as follows:
<0, (6, 7, 9)>
<1, (3, 4, 5)>
<2, (3, 7, 8)>
<7, (0, 2, 6)>
