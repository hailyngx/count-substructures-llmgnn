Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be calculated by counting the total number of 3-star configurations. 

Let's determine the number of 3-star configurations:
1. Node 0: (0, 1, 2), (0, 1, 3), (0, 1, 7) - 3 configurations
2. Node 1: (1, 0, 4), (1, 0, 8), (1, 0, 9) - 3 configurations
3. Node 2: (2, 0, 5), (2, 0, 7), (2, 0, 9) - 3 configurations
4. Node 3: (3, 0, 5), (3, 0, 6) - 2 configurations
5. Node 4: (4, 1, 7), (4, 1, 8) - 2 configurations
6. Node 5: (5, 2, 3) - 1 configuration
7. Node 6: No 3-star configuration
8. Node 7: (7, 0, 4) - 1 configuration
9. Node 8: No 3-star configuration
10. Node 9: No 3-star configuration

After counting the 3-star configurations, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 15.

Therefore, the final answer is [15], and the unique 3-stars are <0, (1, 2, 3)>, <1, (0, 4, 8)>, <2, (0, 5, 7)>, <3, (0, 5, 6)>, <4, (1, 7, 8)>, <5, (2, 3)>, <7, (0, 4)>.
