Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:
[<0, (5, 8, 3)>, <1, (4, 9, 3)>, <2, (7, 4, 1)>, <3, (8, 9, 1)>, <5, (0, 8, 4)>, <6, (9, 8, 3)>, <7, (2, 4, 8)>, <9, (1, 3, 6)>]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
