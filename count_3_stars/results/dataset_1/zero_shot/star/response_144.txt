Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) 

Response:
There are 3-stars existing in this graph. The list of unique 3-stars found is as follows:

<1, (3, 5, 6)>
<3, (1, 4, 7)>
<5, (1, 4, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
