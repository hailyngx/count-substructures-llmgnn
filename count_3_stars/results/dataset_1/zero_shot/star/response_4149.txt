Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in this graph can be obtained by counting the number of times each node acts as the central node of a 3-star. 

Based on the given edges, we can identify the following unique 3-stars:
<0, (5, 6, 7)>
<1, (2, 8, -)>
<2, (1, 4, 6)>
<4, (2, 5, 7)>
<5, (0, 4, 7)>
<6, (0, 2, 7)>
<7, (0, 4, 5)>
<8, (0, 1, 7)>
<9, (0, 6, 7)>

Counting the occurrences of each central node, we find that there are a total of [9] 3-stars in this graph.
