Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The given graph consists of the following 3-stars:
<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<1, (0, 2, 5)>
<2, (0, 1, 5)>
<3, (6, 9, _)>
<4, (1, _, _)>
<5, (0, 1, 2)>
<6, (3, _, _)>
<7, (1, 2, 5)>
<8, (0, _, _)>
<9, (3, 5, _)>
