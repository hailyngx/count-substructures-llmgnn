Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 5, 7)>
<0, (3, 8, 9)>
<0, (5, 7, 8)>
<0, (7, 2, 9)>
<0, (8, 9, 2)>
<0, (9, 4, 8)>
