Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 9) (2, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 5, 7)>
<9, (1, 2, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
