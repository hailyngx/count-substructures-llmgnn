Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The given graph contains the following 3-star structures:
[<0, (5, 7, 8)>, <1, (2, 4, 7)>, <2, (1, 6, 7)>, <3, (6, 7, 8)>, <4, (1, 5, 8)>, <5, (0, 4, 7)>, <6, (2, 3, 7)>, <7, (0, 1, 2)>, <8, (0, 3, 4)>, <9, (1, 2, 5)>]
There are a total of 10 unique 3-stars in this graph.  
So, the final answer is [10].
