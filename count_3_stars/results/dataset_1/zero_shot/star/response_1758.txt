Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (3, 6, 9)>
<3, (1, 2, 6)>
<5, (0, 2, 8)>
<6, (1, 3, 5)>
