Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are 5 different 3-stars in the given graph. Here is the list of unique 3-stars:
<1, (2, 8, 9)>
<3, (1, 4, 5)>
<4, (3, 9, 6)>
<5, (3, 7, 0)>
<7, (5, 8, 6)>
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
