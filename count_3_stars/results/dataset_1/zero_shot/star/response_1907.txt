Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 5) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) 

Response:
There are [3] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (4, 9, 3)>
<1, (6, 7, 8)>
<5, (2, 4, 8)>
