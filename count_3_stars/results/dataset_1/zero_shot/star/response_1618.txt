Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph, which can be listed as follows:

<0, (4, 5, 9)>
<1, (6, 8,  )
<3, (5, 9, )
<4, (0, 6, )
<5, (0, 3, )
<8, (1, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
