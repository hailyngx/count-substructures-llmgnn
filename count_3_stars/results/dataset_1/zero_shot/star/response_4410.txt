Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 0) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The graph contains two 3-stars. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 6, 0)>
<2, (0, 4, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
