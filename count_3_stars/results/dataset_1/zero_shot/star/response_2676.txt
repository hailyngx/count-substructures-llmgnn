Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as:

```
    0 -- 6
    |    |
    6 -- 1 -- 5 -- 8
    |    |    |    |
    7 -- 5 -- 3 -- 8
         |    |    |
         9 -- 4 -- 3
         |    |    |
         2    9 -- 7
                  |
                  4
```

Given the graph, we can identify the following unique 3-stars:

1. <0, (6, 1, 6)>
2. <1, (5, 3, 8)>
3. <2, (9, 3, 4)>
4. <3, (5, 9, 4)>
5. <4, (3, 9, 7)>
6. <5, (1, 3, 8)>
7. <6, (1, 3, 7)>
8. <7, (5, 6, 9)>
9. <8, (1, 5, 3)>
10. <9, (3, 4, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
