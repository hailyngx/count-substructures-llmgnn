Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) 

Response:
There are <0, (2, 4, 6)>, <1, (3, 4, 5)>, and <7, (5, 6, 7)> 3-stars in this graph.
Therefore, there are [3] 3-stars in the given graph.
