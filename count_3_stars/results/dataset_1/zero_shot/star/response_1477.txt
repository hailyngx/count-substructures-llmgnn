Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are:

<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<2, (0, 1, 7)>
<2, (4, 5, 9)>
<3, (4, 6, 7)>
<7, (0, 1, 8)>
<8, (3, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [6].
