Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph contains the following unique 3-stars:
<0, (2, 4, 9)>
<2, (0, 3, 9)>
<4, (0, 6, 9)>
<5, (1, 7, 9)>
<6, (4, 7, 9)>
<7, (5, 6, 9)>

There are a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
