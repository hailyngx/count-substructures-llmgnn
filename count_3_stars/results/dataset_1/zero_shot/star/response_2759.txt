Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the graph can be calculated by focusing on the central nodes. Since each 3-star has one central node, we will count the number of nodes that are the center of a 3-star.

Looking at the provided edges, we can list the central nodes and their connected leaves:

1: 5, 6, 7, 8
2: 3, 6, 7
3: 2, 6, 7
4: 5, 9
5: 1, 4, 7
6: 1, 2, 3
7: 1, 2, 3, 5
8: 1, 9
9: 4, 8

From the list above, we can identify the unique 3-stars:
<1, (5, 6, 7)>
<1, (5, 7, 8)>
<2, (3, 6, 7)>
<4, (5, 9)>
<5, (1, 4, 7)>

There are 5 unique 3-stars in this graph. Therefore, the answer is [5].
