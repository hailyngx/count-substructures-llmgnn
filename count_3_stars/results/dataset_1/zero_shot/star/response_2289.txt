Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 5, 8)>
<0, (4, 5, 9)>
<1, (9, 4, 5)>
<2, (6, 7, 8)>
<2, (7, 2, 8)>
<4, (0, 5, 9)>
