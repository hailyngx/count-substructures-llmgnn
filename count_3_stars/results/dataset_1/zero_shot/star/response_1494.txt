Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 3-star structures in this graph. Here is the list of unique 3-stars found:
    <1, (0, 6, 7)>
    <1, (2, 4, 9)>
    <1, (3, 6, 7)>
    <1, (4, 2, 7)>
    <1, (6, 0, 7)>
    <2, (1, 4, 9)>
    <2, (4, 1, 7)>
    <2, (5, 3, 6)>
    <3, (1, 5, 7)>
    <4, (2, 1, 9)>
    <4, (7, 1, 2)>
    <5, (2, 3, 6)>
    <7, (1, 3, 5)>
