Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 2 different 3-stars in the given graph.  
The 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 5, 1)>
<6, (4, 9, 3)>  

Therefore, the final answer is [2].
