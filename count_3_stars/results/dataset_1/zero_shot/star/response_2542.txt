Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are a total of 6 unique 3-stars in this graph. The final count is [6].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<1, (6, 8, 9)>
<2, (0, 5, 7)>
<3, (0, 8, 4)>
<4, (0, 7, 9)>
<5, (0, 2, 9)>
