Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 6 3-stars in this graph. The unique 3-stars are:

<0, (3, 8, 2)>
<3, (0, 2, 4)>
<5, (1, 2, 7)>
<6, (2, 8, 9)>
<7, (3, 5, 9)>
<9, (1, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the final answer is [6].
