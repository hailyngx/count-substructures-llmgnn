Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph. The unique 3-stars are <0, (1, 3, 5)>, <1, (0, 3, 6)>, <2, (7, 8, 3)>, <3, (0, 1, 7)>, <4, (3, 9, 7)>, and <9, (4, 7, 8)>.
