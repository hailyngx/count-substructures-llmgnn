Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are:
   
   <0, (1, 4, 9)>
   <1, (0, 3, 9)>
   <3, (1, 7, 9)>
   <4, (0, 9, 5)>
   <7, (3, 5, 6)>
   
The total number of 3-stars is therefore [5].
