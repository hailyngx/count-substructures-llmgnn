Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of 3-star configurations. The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
   
1. <0, (1, 2, 4)>
2. <1, (0, 2, 4)>
3. <2, (0, 1, 4)>
4. <3, (0, 2, 5)>
5. <4, (0, 1, 2)>
6. <5, (3, 7, 8)>
7. <6, (1, 9, 6)>
8. <7, (5, 8, 7)>
9. <8, (7, 9, 8)>
10. <9, (0, 1, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
