Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:
  - <0, (1, 5, 6)>
  - <2, (4, 0, 9)>
  - <3, (0, 6, 9)>
  - <4, (2, 0, 5)>

There are a total of 4 unique 3-stars in the graph. Hence, the final answer is [4].
