Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of 6 unique 3-stars in this graph. The count of 3-stars is [6].
  
The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (4, 9, 1)>
<1, (4, 7, 8)>
<2, (3, 7, 4)>
<3, (2, 4, 5)>
<4, (0, 1, 2)>
<5, (1, 3, 6)>
