Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the graph can be found by counting the number of ways we can choose 3 nodes out of the 10 nodes as the center node. 

From the given edges, the unique 3-stars in the graph are:
<0, (4, 7, 9)>
<1, (2, 9, 3)>
<2, (1, 3, 5)>
<3, (2, 6, 8)>
<4, (0, 7, 9)>
<5, (2, 9, 7)>
<6, (3, 7, 9)>
<7, (0, 4, 6)>
<8, (3, 9, 7)>
<9, (0, 1, 3)>

There are 10 possible ways to choose the center node. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
