Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph, which are:
<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<1, (0, 2, 5)>
<2, (1, 4, 5)>
<5, (0, 1, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
