Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 7, 8)>
<2, (6, 7, 8)>
<3, (0, 4, 5)>
<6, (2, 5, 7)>
<7, (0, 2, 6)>
<8, (0, 6, 7)>
