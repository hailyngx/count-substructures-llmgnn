Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of unique 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 5, 8)>
<1, (3, 6, 8)>
<3, (0, 1, 4)>
<6, (1, 2, 4)>
