Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 9) (7, 2) (8, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 3 3-stars in the given graph. The unique 3-stars found are:

<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<3, (0, 1, 4)>
<9, (5, 9, -)> 

Therefore, the final answer is [3].
