Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<3, (2, 4, 5)>
<8, (0, 4, 9)>
