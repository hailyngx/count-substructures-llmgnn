Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 3-star structures in the given graph. The number of 3-stars can be calculated by determining the number of times a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Here is the list of unique 3-stars in the given graph:
<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<2, (0, 3, 4)>
<3, (2, 4, 5)>
<4, (2, 3, 7)>
<5, (0, 3, 6)>
<6, (2, 5, 7)>
<8, (0, 1, 3)>
<9, (8)>  

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
