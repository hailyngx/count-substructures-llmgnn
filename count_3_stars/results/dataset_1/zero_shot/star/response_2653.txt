Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 3 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
The 3-stars are: 
<0, (2, 5, 9)>
<1, (2, 5, 6)>
<4, (6, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
