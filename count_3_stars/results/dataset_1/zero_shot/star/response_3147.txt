Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has <0, (5, 6, 4)>, <1, (4, 6, 2)>, <2, (4, 6, 1)>, <3, (6, 4, 8)>, <4, (1, 2, 6)>, <5, (0, 4, 8)>, <6, (0, 1, 2)>, and <8, (4, 5, 9)> as the unique 3-stars.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
