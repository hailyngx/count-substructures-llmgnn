Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (7, 6, 8)>
<1, (5, 2, 6)>
<2, (4, 5, 9)>
<2, (5, 8, 4)>
<2, (8, 3, 5)>
