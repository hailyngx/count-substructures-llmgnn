Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 5) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in this graph. The count is as follows:

[6]
  
The unique 3-stars are:
  
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<1, (0, 3, 9)>
<2, (3, 6, 9)>
<3, (1, 2, 6)>
<4, (0, 1, 9)>
<5, (0, 6, 8)>
