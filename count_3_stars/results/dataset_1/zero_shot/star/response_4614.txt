Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are [5] 3-stars in the given graph. The unique 3-stars are <0, (4, 5, 9)>, <1, (2, 5, 6)>, <2, (1, 6, 8)>, <3, (5, 6, 7)>, and <6, (1, 2, 8)>.
