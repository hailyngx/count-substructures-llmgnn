Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (5, 1) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
Since a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can search for all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify all the 3-stars in the given graph:

- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 7, and 8. <0, (1, 7, 8)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 5, and 7. <1, (0, 5, 7)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 7, and 8. <2, (3, 7, 8)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 6, and 9. <3, (2, 6, 9)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we find that there are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.
