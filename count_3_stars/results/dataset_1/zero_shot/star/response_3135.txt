Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph. 

<0, (2, 8, 6)>
<1, (3, 4, 7)>
<2, (0, 6, 8)>
<3, (1, 7, 9)>
<4, (1, 5, 7)>
<5, (4, 8, 7)>
