Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are a total of [2] unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are:

<1, (2, 5, 6)>
<3, (2, 4, 6)>
