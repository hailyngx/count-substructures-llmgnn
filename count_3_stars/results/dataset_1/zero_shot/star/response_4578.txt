Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 3 3-stars in the given graph. Here are the unique 3-stars found:
    <0, (1, 3, 6)>
    <2, (1, 6, 9)>
    <5, (2, 3, 4)>
    
    Therefore, the final answer is [3].
