Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 5 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are listed below:

<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<0, (5, 8, 9)>
<3, (5, 6, 8)>
<4, (8, 9, 0)>
<9, (4, 5, 8)>

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
