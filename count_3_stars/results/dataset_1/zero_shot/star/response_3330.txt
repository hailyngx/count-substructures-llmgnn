Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) 

Response:
There are 3-stars with the following central nodes and leaves in the given graph:
      
    <0, (1, 8, 4)>
    <1, (0, 2, 6)>
    <2, (1, 6, 7)>
    <3, (4, 5, 6)>
    <4, (3, 6, 8)>
    <5, (3, 6, 7)>
    <6, (1, 2, 4)>
    <7, (2, 5, 8)>
    <8, (0, 4, 7)>
    
    Therefore, there are [9] total 3-stars in the given graph.
