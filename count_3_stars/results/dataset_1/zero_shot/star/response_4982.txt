Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<4, (2, 3, 5)>
<6, (3, 5, 9)>
<9, (4, 6, 7)>
