Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 0) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in this graph. Here they are listed below:

<1, (4, 8, 3)>
<3, (4, 6, 7)>
<4, (1, 3, 5)>
<8, (1, 3, 5)>

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
