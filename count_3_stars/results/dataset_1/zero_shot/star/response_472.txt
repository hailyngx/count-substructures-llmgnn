This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (3, 7, 8)>
<3, (1, 2, 5)>
