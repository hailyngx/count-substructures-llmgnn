Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (2, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.  

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 8, 9)>
<3, (6, 8, 9)>
<4, (6, 9, 7)>
<5, (7, 9, 8)>
