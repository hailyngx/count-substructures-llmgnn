Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are:

<0, (6, 7, 9)>
<1, (2, 3, 4)>
<3, (1, 7, 9)>
<4, (1, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
