Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].

The unique 3-stars are: <0, (6, 9, 0)>, <1, (2, 4, 6)>, <1, (4, 1, 9)>.
