Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph contains the following 3-stars: 

<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<3, (4, 7, 9)>
<4, (0, 5, 9)>
<5, (0, 1, 4)>
<9, (2, 4, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
