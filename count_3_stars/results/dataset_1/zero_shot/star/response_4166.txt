Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are:
[<0, (1, 5, 0)>, <1, (0, 2, 4)>, <3, (4, 8, 9)>, <4, (1, 3, 6)>, <8, (1, 3, 9)>, <9, (1, 4, 6)>]

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
