Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph: 

    <0, (9, 1, 4)>
    <1, (3, 2, 9)>
    <2, (3, 6, 7)>
    <3, (1, 2, 5)>

This graph contains a total of [4] 3-stars.
