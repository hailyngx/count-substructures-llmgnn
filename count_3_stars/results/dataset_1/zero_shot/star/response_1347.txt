Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
The graph contains the following 3-stars:
[<0, (1, 2, 3)>, <2, (0, 3, 5)>, <3, (0, 2, 4)>]
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
