Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 3 unique 3-stars in this graph. Here they are:

<0, (5, 8, 9)>
<2, (3, 4, 8)>
<4, (2, 5, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
