Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are three 3-stars in the given graph. Here are the unique 3-stars:
    
    <0, (1, 4, 5)>
    <1, (0, 7, 9)>
    <2, (3, 5, 6)>
    
    Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
