Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are:
    
    <0, (3, 7, 8)>
    <0, (3, 7, 9)>
    <0, (3, 8, 9)>
    <0, (7, 8, 9)>
    <3, (0, 7, 9)>
    <9, (0, 3, 4)>
    
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
