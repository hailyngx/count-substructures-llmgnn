Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of 3-star graphs in the given graph can be counted by looking at each node and determining how many 3-stars are connected to it. 

The 3-stars in the graph are as follows:
<0, (1, 4, 8)>
<1, (0, 2, 6)>
<2, (1, 5, 6)>
<3, (7, 9, not connected)>
<4, (0, 5, 8)>
<5, (2, 4, 6)>
<6, (1, 2, 7)>
<7, (1, 3, 6)>
<8, (0, 4, 5)>
<9, (1, 3, 7)>

Thus, there are a total of [10] 3-star graphs in the given graph.
