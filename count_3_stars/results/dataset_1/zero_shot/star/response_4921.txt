Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The 3-stars are as follows:

<0, (2, 5, 8)>
<3, (5, 6, 7)>
<4, (0, 1, 5)>
<5, (0, 3, 8)>
<6, (1, 3, 9)>
<9, (6, 7, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
