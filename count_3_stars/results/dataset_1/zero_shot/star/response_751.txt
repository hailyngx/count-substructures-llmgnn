Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are a total of [7] 3-stars in the given graph.  

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<<0, (3, 1, 5)>, <4, (5, 1, 6)>, <4, (5, 4, 9)>, <5, (1, 5, 9)>, <6, (1, 6, 7)>, <6, (4, 6, 8)>, <7, (1, 7, 9)>>.
