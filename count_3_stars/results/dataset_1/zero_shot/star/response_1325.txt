Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph:
<0, (8, 9, 0)>
<1, (2, 4, 5)>
<2, (1, 5, 9)>
<4, (1, 6, 9)>
<5, (1, 2, 5)>
<9, (0, 2, 4)>
