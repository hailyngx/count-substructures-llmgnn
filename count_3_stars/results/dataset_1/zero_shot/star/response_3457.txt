Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph. 
The unique 3-star configurations are as follows:
<0, (1, 7, 8)>
<3, (4, 5, 7)>
<4, (3, 6, 8)>
<6, (0, 4, 5)>
<7, (0, 3, 9)>
<8, (0, 4, 6)>
