Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are two 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 7, 8)>
<8, (0, 3, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
