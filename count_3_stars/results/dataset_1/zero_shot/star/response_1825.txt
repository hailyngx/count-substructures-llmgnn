Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 6) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph.  
The 3-stars are:
- <2, (0, 8, 9)>
- <6, (1, 3, 4)>
- <6, (5, 7, 4)>
- <6, (3, 4, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
