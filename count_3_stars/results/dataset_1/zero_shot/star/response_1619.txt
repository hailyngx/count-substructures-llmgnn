Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are 4 3-stars in the given graph. Here are the unique 3-stars:
<0, (3, 7, 9)>
<3, (0, 2, 5)>
<4, (5, 6, 7)>
<7, (0, 4, 8)>
Therefore, the final answer is [4].
