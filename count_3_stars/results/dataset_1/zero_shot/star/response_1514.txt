Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The total number of 3-star subgraphs can be calculated by examining each node in the graph and determining how many 3-star configurations it is a part of.

Let's go through each node and identify the 3-stars:
1. Node 0: (0, 5, 9) => <0, (5, 9)>
2. Node 1: (1, 2, 4), (1, 4, 7) => <1, (2, 4, 7)>
3. Node 2: (2, 1, 4), (2, 3, 5), (2, 4, 5) => <2, (1, 4, 5)>
4. Node 3: (3, 2, 4), (3, 4, 7), (3, 5, 0), (3, 5, 9), (3, 7, 1), (3, 8, 3), (3, 9, 5) => <3, (2, 4, 7)>, <3, (5, 0, 9)>
5. Node 4: (4, 1, 2), (4, 2, 5), (4, 3, 7), (4, 5, 0), (4, 5, 2), (4, 5, 6), (4, 7, 1) => <4, (1, 2, 5)>, <4, (5, 0, 6)>
6. Node 5: (5, 0, 9), (5, 2, 3), (5, 2, 4), (5, 3, 4), (5, 4, 7), (5, 6, 5), (5, 9, 0) => <5, (0, 9, 0)>, <5, (2, 3, 4)>, <5, (2, 4, 7)>, <5, (3, 4, 7)>
7. Node 6: (6, 5, 5) => <6, (5, 5, 5)>
8. Node 7: (7, 1, 4), (7, 3, 4) => <7, (1, 4, 3)>
9. Node 8: (8, 3, 3) => <8, (3, 3, 3)>
10. Node 9: (9, 0, 5), (9, 3, 5) => <9, (0, 5, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [11]. The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (5, 9)>, <1, (2, 4, 7)>, <2, (1, 4, 5)>, <3, (2, 4, 7)>, <3, (5, 0, 9)>, <4, (1, 2, 5)>, <4, (5, 0, 6)>, <5, (0, 9, 0)>, <5, (2, 3, 4)>, <5, (2, 4, 7)>, <5, (3, 4, 7)>, <6, (5, 5, 5)>, <7, (1, 4, 3)>, <8, (3, 3, 3)>, <9, (0, 5, 5)>.
