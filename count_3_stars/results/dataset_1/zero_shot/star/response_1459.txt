Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph.

<0, (4, 5, 9)>
<1, (6, 7, 8)>
<2, (7, 9, 9)>
<3, (4, 7, 7)>
<4, (0, 0, 3)>
<5, (6, 9, 9)>
