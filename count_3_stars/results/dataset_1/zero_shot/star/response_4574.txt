Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here are the unique 3-stars found:

<0, (1, 3, 7)>
<1, (0, 4, 5)>
<4, (1, 2, 9)>
<9, (3, 4, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
