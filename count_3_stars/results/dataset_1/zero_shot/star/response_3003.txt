Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are a total of [10] nodes and [22] edges in the given graph.

Let's find the 3-stars:

1. <0, (3, 9, 1)>
2. <1, (5, 6, 9)>
3. <3, (0, 9, 4)>
4. <4, (6, 9, 7)>
5. <5, (1, 7, 9)>
6. <6, (1, 4, 7)>
7. <7, (5, 6, 9)>
8. <9, (0, 1, 3)>

Therefore, there are [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
