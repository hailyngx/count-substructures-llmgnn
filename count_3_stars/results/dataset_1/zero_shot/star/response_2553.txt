Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in this given graph is [8].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (5, 8, 9)>
<1, (6, 7, 9)>
<2, (3, 4, 9)>
<3, (2, 4, 6)>
<4, (2, 3, 5)>
<5, (0, 4, 6)>
<6, (1, 3, 5)>
<7, (1, 2, 9)>
