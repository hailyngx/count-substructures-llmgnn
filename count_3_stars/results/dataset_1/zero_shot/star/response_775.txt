Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be calculated by looking at each node in the graph and checking if it forms a 3-star with its adjacent nodes. 

Let's list the 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (4, 9, _)>  
<1, (2, 5, 9)>  
<2, (1, 4, 5)>  
<4, (0, 2, 5)>  
<5, (1, 2, 4)>  
<6, (5, 7, _)>  
<7, (4, 6, _)>  
<8, (9, _, _)>  

There are a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
