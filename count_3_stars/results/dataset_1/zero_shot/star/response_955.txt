Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [7] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 5, 7)>
<2, (0, 4, 9)>
<4, (2, 5, 9)>
<5, (0, 4, 6)>
<6, (3, 4, 8)>
<7, (0, 9, -)>
<9, (1, 2, 4)>
