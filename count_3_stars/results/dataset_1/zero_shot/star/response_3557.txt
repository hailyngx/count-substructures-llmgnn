Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph. 
The unique 3-stars are <3, (0, 4, 6)>, <4, (3, 5, 6)>, <5, (2, 4, 7)>, and <6, (3, 4, 8)>.
