Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here is the list of those 3-stars:

<0, (3, 4, 6)>
<1, (2, 4, 5)>
<3, (0, 1, 8)>
<4, (0, 1, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
