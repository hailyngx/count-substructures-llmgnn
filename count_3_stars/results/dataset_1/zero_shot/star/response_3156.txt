Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 2) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
The 3-star graphs present in the given graph are:
[<0, (2, 9, 1)>, <2, (0, 1, 4)>, <2, (1, 4, 7)>, <2, (4, 7, 0)>, <3, (4, 6, 8)>, <3, (5, 9, 8)>, <4, (2, 6, 3)>]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
