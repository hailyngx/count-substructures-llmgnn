Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (5, 3) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) 

Response:
There are 2 unique 3-stars in this graph, which are as follows:
1. <1, (0, 7, 8)>
2. <3, (4, 5, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
