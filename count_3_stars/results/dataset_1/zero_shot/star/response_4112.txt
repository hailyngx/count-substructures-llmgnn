Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in this graph can be found by identifying the central node and its connections. Here, node 0, 1, and 6 are central nodes. 
Let's list the 3-stars:

<0, (5, 6, 8)>
<1, (2, 3, 7)>
<6, (1, 3, 8)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
