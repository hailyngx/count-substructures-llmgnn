Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are a total of 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here is the breakdown: 
- 3-star 1: <0, (1, 2, 8)>
- 3-star 2: <1, (0, 5, 7)>
- 3-star 3: <2, (0, 8, 1)>
- 3-star 4: <8, (0, 3, 4)>
Therefore, the final answer is [4].
