Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph. 

<0, (5, 9, 4)>
<2, (6, 7, 9)>
<4, (5, 7, 9)>
<5, (0, 4, 9)>
<6, (2, 8, 9)>
<9, (0, 2, 5)>
