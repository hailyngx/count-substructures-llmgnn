Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 3 unique 3-stars in this graph. 
The 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 9, 9)>
<3, (8, 9, 5)>
<9, (0, 3, 4)>

So the final answer is [3].
