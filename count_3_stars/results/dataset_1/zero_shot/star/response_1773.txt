Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be counted by checking for each node if it forms a 3-star. We will list out the unique 3-stars found in the graph. 

Here are the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (3, 5, 8)>
<1, (3, 4, 8)>
<2, (7, 6, 9)>
<3, (0, 1, 4)>
<4, (1, 3, 8)>
<5, (0, 8, 3)>
<6, (7, 8, 3)>
<7, (2, 3, 6)>
<8, (1, 5, 3)>
<9, (7, 8, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
