Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 3-star structures in the given graph. Here is the list with their central nodes and leaves:
    
<0, (6, 9)>
<1, (2, 8)>
<2, (1, 3, 7)>
<4, (7, 9)>
<5, (7, 9)>
<6, (0, 9)>
<7, (2, 4, 5)>
<8, (1, 7)>
<9, (0, 2, 4, 5, 6)>

Therefore, there are a total of [9] 3-stars in the graph.
