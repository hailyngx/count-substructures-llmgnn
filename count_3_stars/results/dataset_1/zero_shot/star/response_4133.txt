Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are:
[<0, (7, 8, 9)>, <1, (4, 6, 7)>, <2, (4, 7, 9)>]

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
