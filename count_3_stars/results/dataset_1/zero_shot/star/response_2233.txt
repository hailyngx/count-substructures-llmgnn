Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) 

Response:
There are a total of [10] nodes and [34] edges in the given graph. 

To find the number of 3-stars, we need to identify the unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Starting from each node in the graph, we find the 3-stars:  

From node 0:  
- Since node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 7, and 9, it forms the 3-star <0, (1, 4, 7)>.

From node 1:  
- Since node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8, it forms the 3-stars <1, (2, 3, 4)> and <1, (6, 8, 0)>.

From node 2:
- Since node 2 is connected to nodes 1 and 5, it cannot form a 3-star.

From node 3:
- Since node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 6, and 7, it forms the 3-star <3, (4, 6, 7)>.

From node 4:
- Since node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, and 5, it forms the 3-star <4, (0, 1, 3)>.

From node 5:
- Since node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 6, it forms the 3-star <5, (2, 4, 6)>.

From node 6:
- Since node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 5, and 8, it forms the 3-star <6, (1, 3, 5)>.

From node 7:
- Since node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 3, it cannot form a 3-star.

From node 8:
- Since node 8 is connected to nodes 1 and 6, it cannot form a 3-star.

From node 9:
- Since node 9 is connected to node 0, it cannot form a 3-star.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are <0, (1, 4, 7)>, <1, (2, 3, 4)>, <1, (6, 8, 0)>, <3, (4, 6, 7)>, <4, (0, 1, 3)>, <5, (2, 4, 6)>, and <6, (1, 3, 5)>. 

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
