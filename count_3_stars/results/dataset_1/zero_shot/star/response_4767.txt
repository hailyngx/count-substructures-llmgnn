Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are a total of 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are listed inside <>:
<0, (2, 5, 6)>
<1, (4, 7, -)>
<2, (0, 3, 8)>
<3, (0, 2, 9)>
<4, (1, 3, 5)>
<5, (0, 4, 6)>

Therefore, the final answer is [6].
