Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 5 different 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are:

<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<3, (0, 4, 7)>
<4, (1, 3, 5)>
<5, (2, 4, 8)>
<9, (4, 5, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
