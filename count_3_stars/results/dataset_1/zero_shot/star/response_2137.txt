Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (4, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are listed inside <>:

<0, (6, 7, 9)>
<2, (1, 6, 7)>
<6, (0, 2, 3)>
<7, (0, 2, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
