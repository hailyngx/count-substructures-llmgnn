Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-star subgraphs in the given graph is [3].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<2, (1, 4, 8)>
<3, (2, 5, 7)>
<9, (6, 8, 3)>
