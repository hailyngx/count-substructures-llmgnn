Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (6, 7, 9)>
<1, (8, 2, 5)>
<2, (5, 1, 8)>
<4, (5, 9, 6)>
<5, (2, 4, 9)>
<6, (0, 3, 9)>
<7, (0, 8, 6)>
<8, (1, 7, 0)>
