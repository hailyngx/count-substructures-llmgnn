Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the graph can be calculated based on the total number of triangles formed by nodes. In this case, we will need to find the 3-stars in the graph.

We can see that there are a total of 5 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are:

<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<0, (5, 6, 7)>
<2, (4, 8, 9)>
<4, (2, 6, 7)>
<5, (0, 1, 6)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
