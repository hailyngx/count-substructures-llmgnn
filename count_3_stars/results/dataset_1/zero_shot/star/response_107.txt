Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in this graph is [7]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 8, 8)>
<1, (0, 3, 6)>
<2, (5, 9, 9)>
<3, (1, 7, 8)>
<5, (2, 8, 8)>
<6, (1, 9, 9)>
<8, (0, 1, 5)>
