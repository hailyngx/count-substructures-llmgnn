Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph.

<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<2, (0, 3, 8)>
<3, (2, 5, 9)>
<4, (0, 5, 8)>
<5, (2, 3, 4)>
<9, (3, 4,  )]
