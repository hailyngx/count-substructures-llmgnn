Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are a total of [12] 3-stars in the given graph.  

Here are the unique 3-stars: 
<1, (2, 3, 8)>
<2, (1, 5, 9)>
<3, (1, 7, 8)>
<4, (7, 8, 6)>
<5, (0, 2, 9)>
<6, (7, 8, 9)>
