Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, 5, and 8.
Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 7, 8, and 9.
Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 4.
Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 6, and 7.
Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 6, 8, and 9.
Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 6, and 9.
Node 6 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 5, and 9.
Node 7 is connected to nodes 1 and 3.
Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, and 9.
Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 5, 6, and 8.

In this graph, there are 6 different 3-stars: 
<[0, (1, 4, 8)]>, 
<[1, (0, 4, 8)]>, 
<[2, (0, 4, 3)]>, 
<[3, (2, 4, 6)]>, 
<[4, (0, 1, 8)]>, 
<[6, (3, 4, 9)]>. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
