Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The central nodes of the 3-stars in this graph can be identified by counting the nodes with degree 3. Since each 3-star has 3 leaves connected to the central node, counting the central nodes is sufficient to find the total number of 3-stars.

After examining the given edges, we find that the nodes with degree 3 are: 1, 4, 6, and 9.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in this graph are:
<1, (6, 8, 9)>
<4, (6, 8, 9)>
<6, (1, 4, 9)>
<9, (1, 4, 6)>

Hence, there are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.
