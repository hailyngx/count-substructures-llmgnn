Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) 

Response:
There are 3-star graphs in the given graph. Let's identify them:

1. <0, (3, 4, 7)>
2. <3, (0, 2, 4)>
3. <4, (0, 1, 3)>
4. <5, (1, 2, 3)>
5. <6, (5, 7, 8)>
6. <7, (0, 1, 3)>
7. <8, (3, 6, 8)>
8. <9, (0)>

Therefore, there are a total of [8] 3-star graphs in the given graph.
