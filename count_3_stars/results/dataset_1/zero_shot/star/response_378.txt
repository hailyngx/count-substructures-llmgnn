Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 8 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

The 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 6, 9)>
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<2, (1, 3, 5)>
<3, (1, 2, 8)>
<4, (8, 9, -)>
<5, (2, -, -)>
<6, (0, 1, 7)>
<7, (6, 8, -)>

So, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
