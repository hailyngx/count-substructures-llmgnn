Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (5, 6, 9)>
<1, (3, 4, 2)>
<2, (3, 4, 6)>
<3, (1, 2, 6)>
<6, (0, 2, 3)>
<7, (2, 3, 1)>
<9, (0, 3, 8)>
