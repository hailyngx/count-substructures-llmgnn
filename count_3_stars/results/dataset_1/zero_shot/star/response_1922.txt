Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (4, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph consists of 10 nodes and 22 edges. Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

1. Count of 3-stars: [2]
2. Unique 3-stars:
   - <2, (4, 6, 7)>
   - <8, (5, 7, 9)>
