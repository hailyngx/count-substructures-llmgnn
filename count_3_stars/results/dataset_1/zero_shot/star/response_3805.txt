Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (3, 4, 6)>
<2, (4, 7, 8)>
<3, (1, 6, 7)>
<4, (1, 4, 6)>
<5, (4, 5, 8)>
<7, (2, 4, 9)>
