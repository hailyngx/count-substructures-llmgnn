Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The 3-stars are:

<0, (2, 8, 1)>
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<4, (7, 8, -)>
<1, (9, 2, -)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
