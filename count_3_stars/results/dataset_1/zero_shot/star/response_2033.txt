Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (8, 9, 5)>
<2, (3, 7, 4)>
<2, (4, 7, 5)>
<2, (5, 4, 7)>
<3, (2, 7, 9)>
<4, (2, 9, 7)>
