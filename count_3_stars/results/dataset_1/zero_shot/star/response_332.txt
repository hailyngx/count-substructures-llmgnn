Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<2, (3, 5, 7)>
<3, (2, 4, 5)>
<4, (3, 5, 6)>
<5, (3, 4, 7)>
<6, (4, 8, 9)>
<8, (4, 6, 9)>
