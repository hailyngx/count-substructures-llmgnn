Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are <0, (1, 3, 9)>, <1, (0, 2, 5)>, <2, (1, 3, 6)>, <3, (0, 2, 4)>, <4, (3, 5, 6)>, <5, (1, 3, 4)>, <6, (2, 3, 4)>, <8, (3, 6, 9)>, and <9, (0, 2, 8)>.

Therefore, there are [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
