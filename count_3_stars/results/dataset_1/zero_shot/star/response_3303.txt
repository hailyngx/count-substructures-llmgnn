Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The count is simply determined by identifying the nodes with exactly three edges. Below are the unique 3-stars:

<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<1, (2, 3, 5)>
<2, (0, 1, 4)>
<3, (1, 2, 9)>
<4, (0, 2, 8)>
<8, (2, 4, 7)>

So, the final answer is [6].
