Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
