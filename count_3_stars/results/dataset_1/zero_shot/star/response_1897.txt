Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are six 3-stars in this given graph. Here they are:

<0, (3, 6, 9)>
<1, (3, 6, 8)>
<2, (1, 3, 5)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<4, (7, 6, 9)>
<5, (2, 6, 9)>

Therefore, the final answer is [6].
