Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.  
The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (7, 9, 0)>
<1, (8, 1, 0)>
<2, (4, 2, 0)>
<3, (6, 9, 3)>
