Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 3-star patterns in this graph. Let's list them and count how many there are.

1. <0, (1, 4, 6)>
2. <2, (3, 5, 6)>
3. <2, (3, 6, 7)>
4. <2, (5, 6, 9)>
5. <7, (0, 2, 3)>

Therefore, there are a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
