Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
There are a total of [4] 3-stars in the given graph.
The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<1, (0, 2, 9)>
<2, (0, 1, 6)>
<3, (0, 1, 5)>
