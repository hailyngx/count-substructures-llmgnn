Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph. The unique 3-stars are as follows:
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<0, (2, 3, 5)>
<0, (3, 5, 8)>
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<7, (1, 5, 6)>
<7, (5, 6, 7)>
