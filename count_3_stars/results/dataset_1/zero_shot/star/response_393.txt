Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are some duplicate edges provided in the input. Here is the corrected list of edges for the given graph:
- (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 8)
- (1, 0)
- (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 6), (2, 8)
- (3, 0), (3, 2)
- (4, 9)
- (5, 7)
- (6, 2), (6, 7)
- (7, 5), (7, 6), (7, 9)
- (8, 0), (8, 2), (8, 9)
- (9, 4), (9, 7), (9, 8)

Now let's identify the 3-star subgraphs in the given graph.

The 3-star subgraphs are as follows:
1. <0, (1, 2, 3)>
2. <2, (0, 3, 8)>
3. <6, (2, 7, 7)>
4. <7, (5, 6, 9)>
5. <8, (0, 2, 9)>
6. <9, (4, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
