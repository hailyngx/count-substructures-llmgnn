Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

The 3-stars are:
<1, (2, 4, 8)>
<2, (1, 3, 9)>
<3, (2, 4, 5)>
<9, (1, 2, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
