Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-star subgraphs in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<3, (6, 4, 8)>
<4, (6, 7, 9)>
<6, (3, 4, 9)>
<7, (1, 2, 4)>
