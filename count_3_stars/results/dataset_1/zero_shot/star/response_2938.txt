Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The 3-stars are:
    <0, (8, 7, 9)>
    <9, (0, 3, 6)>
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
