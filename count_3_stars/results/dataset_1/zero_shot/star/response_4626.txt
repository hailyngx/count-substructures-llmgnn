Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

The 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 2, 9)>
<1, (0, 4, 5)>
<2, (0, 6, 7)>
<7, (2, 4, 9)>

So, the final answer is [4].
