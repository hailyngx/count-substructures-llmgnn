Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The count is shown below:

[4]

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<4, (3, 5, 6)>
<5, (0, 4, 8)>
<8, (1, 5, 7)>
