Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph can be calculated by counting the number of combinations of 3 leaves connected to the center node. Since the graph is undirected, the order of the leaves does not matter. 

Given the edge list, we can identify the 3-stars. Let's list them:

<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<1, (2, 3, 8)>
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<2, (5, 8, 9)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<3, (7, 8, 2)>
<4, (0, 7, 7)>
<7, (3, 4, 6)>
<8, (1, 2, 3)>
<8, (7, 3, 9)>
<9, (2, 5, 6)>
<9, (8, 6, 5)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we find 12 in total.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
