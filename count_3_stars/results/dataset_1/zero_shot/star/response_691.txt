Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a central node is connected to three other nodes. Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<3, (5, 6, 8)>

Therefore, there is 1 unique 3-star in the given graph, which is [1].
