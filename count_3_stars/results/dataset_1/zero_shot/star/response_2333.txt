Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be counted by looking at each node and checking how many 3-stars can be formed using that node as the center. Since a 3-star has 3 leaves, we need to find nodes that are connected to exactly 3 other nodes.

The nodes with 3 connections are: 1, 8, 9

Let's list the 3-stars:
<1, (5, 7, 8)>
<8, (1, 3, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 8)>

There are [3] 3-stars in the given graph.
