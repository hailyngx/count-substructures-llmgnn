Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 6 three-stars in the given graph. Here they are listed inside brackets:

[6]

And the unique 3-stars found are:

<0, (2, 6, 9)>
<1, (2, 5, 8)>
<2, (0, 1, 8)>
<3, (7, 9, 3)>
<4, (1, 6, 8)>
<5, (1, 7, 8)>
