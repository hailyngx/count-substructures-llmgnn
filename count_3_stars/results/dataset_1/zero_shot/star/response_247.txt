Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 2 3-stars in the given graph: 

<0, (4, 7, 1)>
<2, (3, 9, 5)>

Therefore, the final answer is [2].
