Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 46 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 2 three-stars in the given graph. Here they are listed below:

<0, (2, 5, 6)>
<2, (0, 6, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
