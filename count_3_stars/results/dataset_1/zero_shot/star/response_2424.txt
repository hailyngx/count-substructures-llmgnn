Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 4, 8)>
<3, (1, 4, 8)>
<4, (0, 2, 5)>
<4, (2, 3, 8)>
<4, (3, 5, 7)>
<8, (2, 3, 5)>
