Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 9) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [3] 3-stars in the given graph. 
The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 6, 9)>
<2, (6, 8, 9)>
<9, (1, 3, 6)>
