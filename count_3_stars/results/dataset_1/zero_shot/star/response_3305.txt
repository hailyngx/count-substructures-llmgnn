Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

Here are the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (7, 8, 9)>
<2, (4, 6, 7)>
<3, (5, 9, 7)>
<4, (2, 5, 7)>
