Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph. The unique 3-stars are <0, (1, 2, 5)>, <1, (0, 3, 6)>, <5, (1, 2, 4)>, and <6, (1, 5, 7)>.
