Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 3 unique 3-stars in this graph. The count of 3-stars is [3].
The unique 3-stars are <0, (6, 7, 8)>, <1, (4, 9, 7)>, and <2, (3, 6, 9)>.
