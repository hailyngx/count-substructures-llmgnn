Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the nodes connected in a 3-star pattern. Since 3-stars have a center with exactly three leaves, we look for nodes with three incident edges.

Looking at the provided edges, we can identify the following 3-star structures:
<1, (0, 4, 6)>
<4, (0, 1, 6)>
<5, (2, 3, 7)>
<7, (1, 5, 8)>
<9, (4, 5, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
