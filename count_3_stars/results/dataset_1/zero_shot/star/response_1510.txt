Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are as follows:
- <6, (1, 2, 3)>
- <6, (1, 2, 5)>
- <6, (1, 3, 5)>
- <6, (2, 3, 5)>
- <8, (3, 4, 5)>
- <9, (3, 5, 6)>

There are a total of 6 unique 3-stars in the graph. Therefore, the final answer is [6].
