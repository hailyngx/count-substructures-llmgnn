Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The answer is [6].
   
   The unique 3-stars are:
   <1, (5, 8, 9)>
   <2, (4, 6, 9)>
   <4, (2, 6, 9)>
   <5, (1, 2, 9)>
   <6, (2, 4, 7)>
   <8, (1, 3, 4)>
