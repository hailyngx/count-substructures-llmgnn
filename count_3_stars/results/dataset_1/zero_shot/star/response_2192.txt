Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be found by examining the nodes and their connections. 

Given the information provided, we see that the possible 3-star configurations involve a center node connected to three other nodes. Let's list the unique 3-stars below:

<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<2, (7, 8, 4)>
<4, (0, 5, 7)>
<5, (0, 1, 4)>
<8, (2, 4, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
