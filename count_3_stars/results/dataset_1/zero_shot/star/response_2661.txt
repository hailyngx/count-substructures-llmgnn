Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 5, 9)>
<2, (3, 4, 6)>
<2, (0, 6, 8)>
<2, (0, 3, 8)>
<9, (1, 3, 7)>
