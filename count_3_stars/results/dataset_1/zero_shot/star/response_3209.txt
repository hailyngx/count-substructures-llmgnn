Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
There are 5 3-stars in the given graph. Here are the unique 3-stars found:
   
   <0, (2, 9, 0)>
   <2, (0, 6, 9)>
   <3, (2, 5, 7)>
   <4, (1, 5, 7)>
   <8, (3, 5, 6)>
   
The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
