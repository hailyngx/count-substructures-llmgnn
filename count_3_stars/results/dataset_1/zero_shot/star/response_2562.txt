Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are:

<0, (3, 9, 1)>  
<1, (2, 4, 6)>  
<4, (1, 8, 9)>  
<9, (0, 4, 5)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
