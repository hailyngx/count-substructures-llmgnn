Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of 12 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are:

[<0, (7, 9)>]
[<1, (7, 2)>]
[<2, (5, 6)>]
[<3, (4, 5)>]
[<4, (3, 6)>]
[<5, (2, 3)>]
[<6, (2, 5)>]
[<7, (0, 1)>]
[<8, (9, 9)>]
[<9, (0, 3)>]
[<9, (4, 8)>]
[<9, (7, 9)>]
