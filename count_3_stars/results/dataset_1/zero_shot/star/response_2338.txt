Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (4, 7, 9)>
<1, (7, 8, 9)>
<2, (5, 6, 8)>
<3, (6, 8, 9)>
<4, (0, 7, 8)>
<5, (2, 8, 9)>
