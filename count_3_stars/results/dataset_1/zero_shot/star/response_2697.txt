Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph contains the following 3-stars:

[<2, (4, 5, 7)>, <4, (1, 2, 3)>, <7, (0, 8, 9)>] 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
