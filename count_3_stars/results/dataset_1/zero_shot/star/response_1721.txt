Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in this graph can be found by first identifying all the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 
From the given edges, we see that nodes 0, 4, and 6 are connected to three other nodes, meeting the criteria for being the central nodes of 3-stars. 

Next, we need to find the leaves connected to these central nodes:

For central node 0:
- <0, (3, 7, 8)>
  
For central node 4:
- <4, (3, 5, 7)>
- <4, (3, 6, 7)>
- <4, (5, 6, 7)>

For central node 6:
- <6, (3, 4, 7)>
- <6, (4, 5, 7)>
- <6, (4, 7, 9)>

Counting the unique 3-stars identified, we find a total of [7].
