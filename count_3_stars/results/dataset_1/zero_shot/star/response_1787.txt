Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph contains the following 3-stars:
- <1, (3, 5, 6)>
- <3, (1, 4, 7)>
- <4, (3, 5, 9)>
- <5, (1, 4, 6)>
- <7, (3, 4, 8)>
- <8, (3, 7, 9)>
- <9, (4, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
