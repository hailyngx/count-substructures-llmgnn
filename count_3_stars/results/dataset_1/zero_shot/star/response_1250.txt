Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 6, 9)>
<1, (0, 2, 8)>
<6, (0, 7, 9)>
<7, (3, 6, 8)>
