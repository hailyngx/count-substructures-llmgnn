Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:
- <0, (1, 4, 7)>
- <1, (0, 4, 3)>
- <2, (3, 4, 8)>
- <3, (1, 2, 1)>
- <4, (0, 1, 2)>
- <5, (7, 7, 9)>
- <6, (8, 9, 7)>
- <7, (0, 5, 8)>
- <8, (2, 6, 7)>
- <9, (6, 7, 9)>

Therefore, there are a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
