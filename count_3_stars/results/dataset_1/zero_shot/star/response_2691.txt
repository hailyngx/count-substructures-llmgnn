Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<0, (4, 8, 9)>
<0, (5, 2, 3)>
<4, (0, 3, 8)>
<4, (3, 5, 8)>
<4, (5, 0, 3)>
