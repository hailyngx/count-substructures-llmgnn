Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are as follows:
- <0, (4, 5, 6)>
- <4, (0, 3, 6)>
- <5, (0, 1, 3)>
- <6, (0, 1, 4)>
- <7, (6, 8, 9)>
- <8, (7, 6, 0)>
- <9, (6, 7, 0)>

Count of 3-stars in the graph: [7]
