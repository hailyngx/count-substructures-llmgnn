Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in this graph.  

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (7, 2, 9)>
<1, (2, 9, 3)>
<2, (1, 9, 3)>
<3, (2, 9, 6)>
<4, (9, 6, 5)>
<6, (9, 4, 3)>
