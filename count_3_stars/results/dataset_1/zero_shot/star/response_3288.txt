Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are two 3-stars in the given graph. 
The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (2, 6, 7)>
<2, (1, 0, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
