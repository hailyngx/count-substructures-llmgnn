Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here are the unique 3-stars:

<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<1, (0, 4, 7)>
<4, (1, 2, 9)>
<5, (0, 3, 6)>

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
