Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in this graph. The 3-stars are:

<2, (1, 4, 7)>
<3, (4, 6, 7)>
<4, (2, 3, 7)>
<7, (1, 4, 5)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
