Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has 3 3-stars. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 2, 7)>
<1, (0, 2, 5)>
<2, (0, 1, 4)>

Therefore, the final answer is [3].
