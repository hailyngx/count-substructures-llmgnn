Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (8, 2) (9, 2) 

Response:
The unique 3-stars in the given graph are as follows:
<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<1, (2, 6, 0)>
<3, (0, 4, 6)>
<4, (0, 3, 5)>
<6, (1, 3, 0)>
[(0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)]
