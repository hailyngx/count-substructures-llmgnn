Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
There are [3] 3-stars in the given graph.
    
    <8, (2, 3, 4)>
    <6, (1, 3, 5)>
    <7, (1, 4, 8)>
