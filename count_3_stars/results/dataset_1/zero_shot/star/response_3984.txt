Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are [2] 3-stars in the given graph.  

The unique 3-stars are:  
<3, (4, 6, 9)>  
<4, (3, 6, 8)>
