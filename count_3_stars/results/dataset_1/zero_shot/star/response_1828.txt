Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
The structure of the graph can be visualized as follows:
```
     1 - 4 - 9
     | \ |     
     3 - 0 - 6  
       \ | /    
         5      
         |      
         7 - 8  
```

To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify all the central nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. In this case, there are two such 3-stars:

1. \( <0, (3, 4, 6)> \)
2. \( <3, (0, 1, 5)> \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
