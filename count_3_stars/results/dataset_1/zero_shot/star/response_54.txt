Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:
\[<0, (2, 5, 8)> <1, (3, 4, 8)> <2, (0, 4, 5)> <3, (1, 8, 9)> <4, (1, 2, 5)> <5, (0, 2, 4)> <8, (0, 1, 3)>\]
Count of 3-stars: [7]
