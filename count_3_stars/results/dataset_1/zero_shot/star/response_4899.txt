Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are:

<0, (3, 8, 2)>
<1, (6, 7, 9)>
<2, (4, 9, 5)>
<9, (2, 5, 7)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
