Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be found by counting the unique sets of a central node and three leaf nodes.

To find the 3-stars, we will look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

Here are the 3-stars found in the given graph:
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<1, (7, 8, 6)>
<3, (7, 9, -)>
<4, (0, 8, -)>
<7, (1, 3, 6)>
<8, (1, 4, 9)>
<9, (3, 8, -)>

Counting the unique 3-stars gives us a total of [7].
