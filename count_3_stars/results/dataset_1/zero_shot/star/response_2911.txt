Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-star structures:
[<0, (5, 6, 8)>, <1, (4, 5, 7)>, <2, (3, 5, 9)>, <3, (2, 4, 6)>]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
