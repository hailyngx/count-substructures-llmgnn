Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (6, 7, 8)>
<1, (6, 7, 8)>
<2, (3, 9, 4)>
<3, (2, 7, 8)>
<4, (5, 9, 2)>
<5, (4, 9, 2)>
