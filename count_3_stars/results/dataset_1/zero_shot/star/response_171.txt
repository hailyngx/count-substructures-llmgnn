Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 5, 9)>
<1, (2, 5, 7)>
<3, (4, 7, 8)>
<4, (0, 3, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4.  
The final answer is [4].
