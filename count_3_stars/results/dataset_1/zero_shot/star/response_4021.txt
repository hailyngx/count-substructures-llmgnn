Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are [3] 3-stars in the given graph.  
The unique 3-stars found are:  
<0, (1, 4, 5)>  
<4, (0, 3, 6)>  
<7, (0, 8, -)>
