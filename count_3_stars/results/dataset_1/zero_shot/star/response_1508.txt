Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be found by counting the number of unique sets of 3 leaves connected to a common center node.

Counting the 3-stars in the graph:
1. Center node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 6, 8, and 9. Among these, there are 4 unique 3-stars: <0, (1, 4, 6)>, <0, (1, 4, 8)>, <0, (1, 6, 9)>, <0, (4, 6, 8)>.
2. Center node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 6. Among these, there are no 3-stars as all possible combinations have been considered under center node 0.
3. Center node 2 is connected to nodes 1 and 7. Among these, there are no 3-stars.
4. Center node 3 is connected to nodes 4 and 7. Among these, there are no 3-stars.
5. Center node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 5, 7, and 8. Among these, there are 4 unique 3-stars: <4, (0, 3, 7)>, <4, (0, 5, 7)>, <4, (0, 7, 8)>, <4, (3, 5, 8)>.
6. Center node 5 is connected to nodes 4, 7, and 8. Among these, there are no 3-stars as all possible combinations have been considered under center node 4.
7. Center node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 7. Among these, there are no 3-stars as all possible combinations have been considered under center node 0.
8. Center node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 9. Among these, there are 4 unique 3-stars: <7, (2, 3, 7)>, <7, (2, 4, 5)>, <7, (3, 4, 5)>, <7, (4, 5, 6)>.
9. Center node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 5. Among these, there are no 3-stars as all possible combinations have been considered under center node 0.
10. Center node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 7. Among these, there are no 3-stars as all possible combinations have been considered under center node 0.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8] (found in the brackets).
