Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (2, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (5, 4, 9)>
<3, (4, 5, 9)>
<4, (3, 5, 7)>
<6, (7, 8, 9)>
<9, (3, 5, 6)>
