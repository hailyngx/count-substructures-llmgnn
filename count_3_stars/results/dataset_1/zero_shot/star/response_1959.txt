Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:

[<0, (2, 6, 8)>, <1, (2, 9, 9)>, <2, (0, 1, 5)>, <3, (4, 7, 7)>, <4, (3, 9, 9)>, <5, (2, 7, 7)>, <6, (0, 7, 7)>, <7, (3, 5, 6)>, <8, (0, 0, 0)>, <9, (1, 2, 4)>]

There are 10 unique 3-stars in total. The final count inside brackets is [10].
