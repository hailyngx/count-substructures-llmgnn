Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated by finding all occurrences of a node that is connected with exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph.

Given edges: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 5)

We can see that the possible 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 5, 1)>
<1, (0, 3, 8)>
<2, (4, 5, 8)>
<3, (1, 4, 1)>
<4, (2, 3, 6)>
<5, (0, 2, 6)>
<6, (4, 5, 7)>
<7, (5, 6, 5)>
<8, (1, 2, 4)>
<9, (4, 5, 5)>

After examining the graph, we find that there are 10 unique 3-stars. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [10].
