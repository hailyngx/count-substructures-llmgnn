Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<2, (3, 5, 8)>
<3, (2, 5, 6)>
<4, (2, 5, 6)>
<5, (2, 3, 4)>
<6, (2, 3, 4)>
