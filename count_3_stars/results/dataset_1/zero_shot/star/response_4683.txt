Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [2].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (7, 8, 9)>
<9, (0, 2, 4)>
