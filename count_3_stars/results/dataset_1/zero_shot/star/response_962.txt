Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 7) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [8] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<1, (0, 3, 8)>
<1, (0, 8, 9)>
<1, (3, 8, 9)>
<1, (8, 9, 2)>
<1, (8, 9, 7)>
<1, (8, 9, 6)>
<9, (2, 6, 7)>
