Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph:
<0, (3, 5, 6)>
