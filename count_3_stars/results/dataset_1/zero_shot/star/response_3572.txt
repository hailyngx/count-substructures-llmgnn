Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (2, 9, 1)>
<7, (1, 5, 8)>
<8, (4, 7, 3)>
<2, (9, 0, 6)>
<6, (1, 9, 7)>
<9, (0, 2, 6)>
