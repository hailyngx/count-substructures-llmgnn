Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are a total of [21] 3-stars in the given graph.

Here are the unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<2, (0, 4, 6)>
<2, (3, 6, 7)>
<2, (4, 7, 8)>
<5, (0, 4, 8)>
<5, (1, 4, 8)>
<5, (2, 8, 9)>
<6, (2, 9, 6)>
<9, (1, 5, 6)>
