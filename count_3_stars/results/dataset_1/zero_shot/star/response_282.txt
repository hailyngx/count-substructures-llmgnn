Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:
1. <0, (3, 5, 8)>
2. <0, (3, 5, 9)>
3. <0, (5, 2, 8)>
4. <0, (5, 2, 9)>
5. <2, (4, 6, 9)>
6. <2, (5, 6, 9)>
7. <4, (2, 7, 5)>
8. <9, (0, 8, 2)>

Therefore, there are a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
