Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 3 unique 3-stars in the given graph. They are:
<0, (8, 4, 6)>
<3, (4, 6, 9)>
<7, (5, 8, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
