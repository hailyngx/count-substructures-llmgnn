Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be calculated by identifying all possible combinations of a center node connected to three other nodes.

First, let's list all the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (7, 8, 9)>
<1, (7, 8, 9)>
<2, (3)>
<3, (2, 9)>
<4, (5, 7, 8)>
<5, (4, 6)>
<6, (5, 7, 9)>
<7, (0, 1, 4, 6, 8)>
<8, (0, 1, 4, 7)>
<9, (0, 1, 3, 6)>

Since there are 10 possible center nodes (0 through 9) and we have already listed all the unique 3-stars formed from these center nodes in the given graph, we can see that there are 10 3-stars in total.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
