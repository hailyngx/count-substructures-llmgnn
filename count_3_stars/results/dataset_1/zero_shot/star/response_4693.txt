Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of 3-star configurations in the given graph can be calculated by counting the number of nodes which, when taken as the central node, have exactly three adjacent nodes connected to them. 

From the given edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:

<0, (2, 9, 0)>
<1, (4, 8, 1)>
<2, (0, 4, 9)>, <2, (3, 4, 8)>
<3, (2, 5, 8)>
<4, (1, 2, 8)>
<5, (3, 6, 7)> (It's a 3-star with node 5 as the central node, and nodes 3, 6, and 7 as the leaves)
<6, (5, 8, 0)>
<7, (3, 5, 0)>
<8, (1, 3, 4)>, <8, (2, 6, 9)>
<9, (0, 2, 8)>

Counting all the unique 3-stars above, we find that there are [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
