Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 4) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The count inside brackets is [4].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 8, 4)>
<1, (5, 3, 6)>
<2, (0, 4, 7)>
<5, (1, 3, 6)>
