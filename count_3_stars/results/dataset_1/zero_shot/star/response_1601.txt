Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The 3-stars are as follows:

<0, (3, 9, 1)>
<3, (0, 2, 4)>
<6, (2, 5, 3)>
<9, (0, 1, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
