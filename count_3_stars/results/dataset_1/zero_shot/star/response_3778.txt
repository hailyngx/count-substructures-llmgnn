Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.  

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (3, 6, 2)>
<3, (1, 4, 7)>
<4, (3, 6, 9)>
<6, (1, 2, 4)>
