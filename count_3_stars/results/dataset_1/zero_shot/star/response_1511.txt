Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [5] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<2, (3, 4, 9)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<6, (3, 7, 8)>
<8, (6, 7, 9)>
