Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are a total of 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<1, (0, 3, 6)>
<2, (0, 3, 6)>
<4, (0, 6, 7)>
<6, (1, 2, 4)>
<8, (0, 5, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
