Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 2) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in this graph. The 3-stars are:
- <0, (5, 7, 1)>
- <2, (5, 9, 8)>
- <5, (0, 1, 2)>
- <6, (2, 3, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
