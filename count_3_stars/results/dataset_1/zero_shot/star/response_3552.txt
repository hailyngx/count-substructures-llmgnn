Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
The central nodes in a 3-star must have degree 3, meaning they must be connected to exactly 3 other nodes. Here are the unique 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (1, 3, 6)>
<1, (0, 2, 4)>
<4, (1, 7, 8)>
<5, (1, 6, 7)>
<8, (4, 7, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 8)>

Therefore, there are a total of [6] 3-stars in the graph.
