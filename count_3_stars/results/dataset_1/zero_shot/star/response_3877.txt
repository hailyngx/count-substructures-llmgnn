Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [16] 3-stars in the given graph.  

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<0, (5, 7, 9)>
<2, (0, 3, 4)>
<2, (3, 0, 7)>
<3, (2, 7, 9)>
<4, (0, 6, 9)>
<5, (0, 6, 7)>
<6, (5, 7, 8)>
<7, (0, 6, 8)>
<8, (7, 9, 5)>
