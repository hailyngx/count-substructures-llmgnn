Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 1) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 6) (9, 2) 

Response:
The given graph contains the following 3-stars:

[<1, (2, 4, 7)>, <1, (4, 6, 7)>, <2, (1, 6, 9)>, <3, (5, 6, 8)>, <4, (1, 6, 7)>, <5, (3, 6, 8)>] 

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
