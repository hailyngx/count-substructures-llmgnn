Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 3 unique 3-star subgraphs in the given graph. 

The 3-stars are: 
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<2, (0, 1, 5)>
<5, (2, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
