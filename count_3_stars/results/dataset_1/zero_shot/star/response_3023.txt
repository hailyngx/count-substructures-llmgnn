Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
There are [2] 3-stars in the given graph.  

The unique 3-stars are:  
<2, (0, 4, 7)>  
<3, (1, 4, 6)>
