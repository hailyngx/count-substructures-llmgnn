Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are <0, (4, 5, 6)>, <0, (4, 5, 7)>, and <4, (0, 5, 9)> 3-stars in the given graph.   
   
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
