Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be calculated by counting the number of 4-cliques (complete subgraphs with 4 nodes) in the graph. This is because each 3-star can be represented by a 4-clique where one of the nodes is the center of the 3-star.

First, let's list all the 4-cliques in the graph:
<0, 3, 4, 9>
<0, 4, 8, 9>
<0, 5, 6, 9>
<1, 3, 4, 8>
<2, 4, 9, 6>

Counting these, we find that there are 5 unique 4-cliques in the graph. Therefore, there are [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
