Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has 3-star configurations at the following central nodes:
[<2, (1, 3, 4)>, <3, (2, 6, 7)>, <4, (2, 8, 9)>, <8, (3, 4, 9)>, <9, (2, 5, 8)>]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
