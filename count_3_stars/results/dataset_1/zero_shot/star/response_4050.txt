Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of [10] nodes and [30] edges in the given graph.

To determine the number of 3-stars in the graph, we look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars present in the graph:

<0, (1, 3, 3)>
<1, (0, 2, 7)>
<3, (0, 1, 4)>
<4, (2, 3, 6)>
<5, (6, 9, 9)>
<6, (4, 5, 5)>
<7, (1, 3, 1)>
<8, (1, 3, 9)>
<9, (3, 5, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
