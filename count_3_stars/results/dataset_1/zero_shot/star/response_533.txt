Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) 

Response:
The given graph contains the following 3-stars:

[<0, (1, 3, 4)>, <3, (0, 1, 7)>, <6, (2, 7, 8)>, <7, (3, 6, 8)>, <8, (6, 7, 8)>]

Therefore, there are [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
