Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) 

Response:
There are 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The 3-stars are:
<1, (4, 5, 8)>
<6, (2, 7, 6)>
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
