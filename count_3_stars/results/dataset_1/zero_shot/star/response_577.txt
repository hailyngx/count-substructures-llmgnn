Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph.

The 3-stars are:
<2, (0, 3, 4)>
<4, (2, 5, 7)>
<5, (1, 4, 6)>
<6, (1, 2, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
