Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are:
    
    <0, (1, 4, 5)>
    <0, (1, 8, 9)>
    <1, (0, 6, 2)>
    <3, (2, 5, 9)>
    <3, (5, 7, 6)> 

Therefore, there are a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
