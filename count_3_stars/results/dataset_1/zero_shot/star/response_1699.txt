Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (3, 6, 0)>
<3, (0, 4, 8)>
<4, (3, 8, 7)>
<5, (1, 7, 9)>
<7, (5, 8, 9)>
<8, (4, 9, 7)>
