Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 4, 7)>
<1, (0, 3, 7)>
<2, (3, 6, 9)>
<8, (0, 5, 6)>
