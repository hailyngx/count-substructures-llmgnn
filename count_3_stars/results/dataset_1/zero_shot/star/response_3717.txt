Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are <0, (6, 8, 9)>, <2, (3, 4, 7)>, <3, (2, 6, 9)>, <4, (2, 8, 7)>, <6, (0, 3, 5)>, <7, (4, 6, 8)> as the 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
