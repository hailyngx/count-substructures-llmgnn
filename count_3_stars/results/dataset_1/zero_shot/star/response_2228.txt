Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<2, (1, 7, 9)>
<4, (2, 5, 8)>
<5, (0, 3, 4)>
<7, (0, 2, 8)>
