Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are a total of [4] 3-stars in the given graph.
<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<1, (4, 7, 8)>
<3, (0, 5, 6)>
