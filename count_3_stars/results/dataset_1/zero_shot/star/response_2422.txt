Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be found by checking each node as the potential center of the 3-star.  

Here are the 3-stars in the given graph:
[<0, (1, 6, 9)>, <1, (0, 3, 5)>, <4, (1, 2, 3)>, <5, (1, 2, 3)>]

There are 4 unique 3-stars. Therefore, the final answer is [4].
