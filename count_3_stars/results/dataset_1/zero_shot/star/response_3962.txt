Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are total of [4] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<2, (0, 4, 5)>
<3, (1, 2, 6)>
<5, (0, 2, 8)>
