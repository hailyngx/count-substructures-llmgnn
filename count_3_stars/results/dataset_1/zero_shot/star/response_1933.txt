Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 5) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph is as follows:
```
          3 ------ 5 ------ 7
         / \       / \
        /   \     /   \
       5     2   5     6
        \   /     \   /
         \ /       \ /
          4 ------- 9
           \       /
            \     /
              0
```

To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we first identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. We can see that nodes 0, 4, 6, and 8 each form a 3-star with their neighboring nodes. Let's list these 3-stars:
- <0, (8, 9)>
- <4, (1, 9, 5)>
- <6, (7, 9)>
- <8, (0, 5, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
