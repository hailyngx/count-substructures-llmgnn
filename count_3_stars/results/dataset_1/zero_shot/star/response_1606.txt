Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 3-star graphs in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<1, (0, 4, 8)>
<2, (0, 3, 4)>
<3, (0, 2, 4)>
<4, (1, 2, 3)>
<5, (2, 4, 8)>
<7, (5, 7, 9)>
<8, (1, 3, 4)>
<9, (1, 4, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
