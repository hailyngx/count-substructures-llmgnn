Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are as follows:
   
    <0, (7, 9, 0)>
    <1, (5, 8, 1)>
    <2, (3, 4, 2)>
    <2, (9, 8, 2)>
    <5, (6, 7, 5)>
    <5, (8, 1, 5)>
    <5, (9, 0, 5)>
    <7, (5, 6, 7)>
    <8, (1, 5, 8)>
    <9, (0, 2, 9)>
    
    So, there are [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
