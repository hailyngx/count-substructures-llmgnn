Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are [12] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 9, 2)>
<1, (6, 7, 8)>
<2, (3, 4, 7)>
<2, (4, 7, 8)>
<2, (7, 8, 9)>
<3, (0, 2, 7)>
<5, (6, 7, 9)>
<6, (1, 5, 7)>
<7, (1, 2, 5)>
<7, (1, 2, 3)>
<8, (1, 2, 7)>
<9, (0, 2, 5)>
