Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated by finding 4-cycles in the graph, as each 4-cycle contains two 3-stars. The total number of 4-cycles can be calculated using the formula: 
\[ \frac{1}{4} \sum_{i} deg(v_i)^2 - \sum_{ij} A_{ij}^2 \]

where \( deg(v_i) \) is the degree of node \( v_i \) and \( A_{ij} \) is the adjacency matrix of the graph.

After finding the 4-cycles, we can determine the number of 3-stars because each 3-star is formed by removing one edge from each 4-cycle.

Now, let's determine the 3-stars in the given graph using the given edge information: 
1. <0, (1, 5, 6)>
2. <2, (3, 4, 5)>
3. <3, (2, 4, 6)>
4. <4, (2, 3, 9)>
5. <5, (0, 2, 8)>
6. <6, (0, 3, 4)>
7. <7, (3, 5, 8)>
8. <8, (0, 2, 7)>
9. <9, (0, 4, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
