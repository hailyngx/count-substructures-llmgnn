Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 3) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.  

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (2, 4, 5)>
<3, (2, 7, 9)>
<6, (0, 1, 9)>
<9, (3, 6, 8)>
