Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
There are total of [7] 3-stars in this graph.

<0, (2, 8, 9)>
<2, (0, 6, 9)>
<3, (6, 8, 3)>
<4, (1, 6, 4)>
<6, (2, 3, 4)>
<8, (0, 3, 7)>
<9, (0, 2, 6)>
