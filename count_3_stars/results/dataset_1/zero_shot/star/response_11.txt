Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 3-stars in the given graph. Here are the unique 3-stars found:

<0, (1, 4, 8)>
<1, (0, 5, 9)>
<3, (0, 4, 8)>
<4, (0, 3, 8)>
<5, (1, 6, 9)>
<6, (1, 5, 9)> 
<8, (0, 4, 5)>
<9, (1, 5, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
