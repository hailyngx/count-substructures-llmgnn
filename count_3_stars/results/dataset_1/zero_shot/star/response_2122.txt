Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to node 2.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 7, and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 5, 7, and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 4 and 7.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 3, 6, and 8.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 6, and 8.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 4, 5.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 3.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 4, 5.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 2.

We can identify the 3-stars present in the graph: 
<2, (0, 1, 5)>
<2, (1, 7, 9)>
<4, (3, 6, 8)>
<5, (2, 6, 8)>
<7, (1, 2, 9)> 

Counting the total number of 3-stars, we get a total of [5].
