Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. Let's find the number of 3-stars in this graph.

To find the 3-stars in the graph, we look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Since the definition of a 3-star includes the central node and 3 leaves, we will examine nodes connected to three neighbors.

Examining the graph, we find that the central nodes which are connected to exactly three other nodes are: 0, 3, 5, and 8.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars in this graph:
- <0, (2, 4, 6)>
- <3, (5, 6, 9)>
- <5, (3, 6, 8)>
- <8, (0, 1, 9)>

Counting the unique 3-stars we found, we get 4 in total.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
