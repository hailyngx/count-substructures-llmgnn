Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 1) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The graph described has the following 3-star configurations:
<0, (6, 9, 1)>
<1, (2, 3, 6)>
<2, (1, 7, 9)>
<3, (1, 6, 9)>
<5, (6, 7, 9)>
<6, (0, 1, 5)>
<7, (2, 5, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 4)>

Therefore, there are a total of [8] 3-stars in this graph.
