Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 7 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are listed uniquely:

<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<0, (3, 5, 9)>
<3, (2, 4, 9)>
<3, (4, 6, 8)>
<3, (6, 8, 9)>
<4, (0, 3, 9)>

Therefore, the final answer is [7].
