Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 8.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 6.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, and 8.
- Node 3 is connected to node 7.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 6.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0 and 6.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 5.
- Node 7 is connected to node 3.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0 and 2.

To count the number of 3-stars, we need to find patterns where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. In this case, only node 2 forms 3-stars. 

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1], and the unique 3-star is <2, (0, 1, 8)>.
