Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are 3-star structures in this graph. Here are the unique 3-stars found:

<0, (2, 4, 7)>
<3, (1, 6, 9)>
<4, (0, 6, 9)>
<7, (1, 4, 8)>
<8, (2, 3, 6)>

Total number of 3-stars: [5]
