Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
The 3-stars are: 
<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<1, (0, 4, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
