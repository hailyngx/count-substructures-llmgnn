Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are <1, (3, 4, 6)>, <4, (0, 1, 6)>, and <6, (1, 4, 9)>.
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
