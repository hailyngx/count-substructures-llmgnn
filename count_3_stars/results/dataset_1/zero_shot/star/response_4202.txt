Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (4, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:  
- <0, (7, 8, 9)>  
- <1, (3, 7, 0)>  
- <2, (8, 0, 0)>  
- <3, (1, 1, 7)>  
- <4, (6, 6, 9)>  
- <5, (9, 9, 0)>  
- <6, (4, 9, 9)>  
- <7, (0, 1, 0)>  
- <8, (0, 2, 0)>  
- <9, (0, 5, 6)>  

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
