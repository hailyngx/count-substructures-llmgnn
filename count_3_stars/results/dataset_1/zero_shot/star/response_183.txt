Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are [10] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 3, 9)>
<1, (2, 3, 4)>
<1, (3, 4, 5)>
