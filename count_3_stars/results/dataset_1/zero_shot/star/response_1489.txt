Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph G has 10 nodes and 26 edges. We are interested in counting the number of 3-stars in this graph.

To find the 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will form the centers of the 3-stars. Let's list the unique 3-stars:

<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<1, (5, 6, 9)>
<4, (0, 2, 6)>
<5, (0, 1, 6)>
<6, (0, 1, 4)>
<9, (1, 4, 5)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars gives us a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
