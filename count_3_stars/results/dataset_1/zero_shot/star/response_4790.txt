Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
There are two unique 3-stars in the given graph. The count of 3-stars in the graph is [2].

<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<1, (0, 7, 8)>
