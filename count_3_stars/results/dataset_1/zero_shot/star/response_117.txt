Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph can be found by identifying all possible unique 3-stars.

In this graph, the central nodes are: 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8.

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
- For central node 0: (0, 2, 3), (0, 3, 8)
- For central node 2: (2, 0, 3), (2, 3, 6)
- For central node 3: (3, 0, 2), (3, 0, 8)
- For central node 4: (4, 1, 6), (4, 6, 7)
- For central node 6: (6, 2, 4), (6, 4, 9)
- For central node 8: (8, 0, 3), (8, 3, 5)

Therefore, there are a total of 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
The answer is [6].
    
The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 3, 8)>
<2, (0, 3, 6)>
<3, (0, 2, 8)>
<4, (1, 6, 7)>
<6, (2, 4, 9)>
<8, (0, 3, 5)>
