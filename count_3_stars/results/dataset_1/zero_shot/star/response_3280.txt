Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 6, 8)>
<1, (2, 4, 5)>
<2, (0, 1, 6)>
<4, (1, 6, 7)>
<5, (1, 3, 9)>
