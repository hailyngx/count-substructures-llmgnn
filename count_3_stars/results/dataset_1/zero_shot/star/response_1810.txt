Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are:

<0, (2, 3, 5)>
<5, (6, 9, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
