Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has several 3-stars. To count them, we need to identify the central node and the three other connected nodes for each 3-star. Here are the unique 3-stars in the graph:

1. <2, (1, 3, 4)>
2. <3, (1, 2, 4)>
3. <4, (2, 3, 9)>
4. <5, (3, 6, 8)>
5. <6, (1, 3, 5)>
6. <7, (0, 4, 5)>
7. <8, (4, 5, 6)>
8. <9, (2, 4, 8)>

There are a total of [8] 3-stars in this graph.
