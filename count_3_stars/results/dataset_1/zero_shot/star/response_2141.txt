Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 6 3-stars in the given graph. Here are the unique 3-stars:

<1, (3, 5, 6)>  
<1, (4, 6, 9)>  
<1, (5, 3, 8)>  
<3, (1, 5, 7)>  
<4, (1, 8, 6)>  
<6, (1, 7, 4)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
