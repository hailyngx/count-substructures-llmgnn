Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. Let's identify the 3-stars present in the graph.

1. 3-star centered at node 5: <5, (1, 2, 8)>
2. 3-star centered at node 8: <8, (1, 4, 5)>
3. 3-star centered at node 9: <9, (2, 5, 7)>

Therefore, there are [3] unique 3-stars in the graph.
