Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 5) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:

[<0, (2, 4, 7)>, <1, (2, 3, 7)>, <3, (1, 5, 9)>, <5, (3, 5, 9)>, <7, (0, 6, 8)>]
