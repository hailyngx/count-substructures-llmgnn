Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-star structures:

[<2, (3, 4, 5)>, <2, (5, 7, 9)>] 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
