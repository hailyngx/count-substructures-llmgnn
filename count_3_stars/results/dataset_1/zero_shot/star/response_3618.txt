Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 6) 

Response:
There are 4 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 7, 8)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<2, (4, 5, 6)>
<6, (2, 3, 5)>

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
