Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are <0, (4, 5, 6)>, <1, (3, 7, 9)>, and <2, (3, 6, 8)> 3-stars in the graph. Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
