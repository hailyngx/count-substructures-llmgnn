Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) 

Response:
The graph is as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2 and 7.
- Node 1 is connected to node 2.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 5, and 6.
- Node 3 is connected to node 4.
- Node 4 is connected to node 3.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2 and 8.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 2 and 8.
- Node 7 is connected to node 0.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 5 and 6.

To count the number of 3-star subgraphs:
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors (0, 1, 5, 6).
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors (2, 8).
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors (2, 8).

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3] and the unique 3-star subgraphs are:
<2, (0, 1, 5)>
<2, (0, 1, 6)>
<2, (5, 6, 8)>
