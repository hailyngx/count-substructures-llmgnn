Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 1) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<1, (0, 6, 8)>
<4, (1, 8, 9)>
<6, (0, 1, 5)>
