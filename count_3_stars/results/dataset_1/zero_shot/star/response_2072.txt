Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 2 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (6, 8, 2)>
<9, (8, 7, 5)>

Therefore, the final answer is [2].
