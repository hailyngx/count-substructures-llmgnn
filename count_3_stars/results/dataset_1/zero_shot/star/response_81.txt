Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
There are 3 unique 3-star graphs in the given graph. Therefore, the answer is [3].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (6, 7, 9)>
<2, (3, 4, 5)>
<3, (2, 5, 6)>
