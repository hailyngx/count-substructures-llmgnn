Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 2) 

Response:
There are 6 different 3-stars in this graph. 
The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 4, 7)>
<0, (2, 6, 8)>
<1, (0, 7, 8)>
<2, (0, 7, 9)>
<3, (5, 8, -)>
<4, (0, 1, 6)>
The final answer is [6].
