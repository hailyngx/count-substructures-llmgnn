Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
There are 3 unique 3-star subgraphs in the given graph. Therefore, the answer is [3].

The 3-stars are:
<1, (0, 5, 6)>
<5, (0, 1, 2)>
<7, (5, 8, 1)>
