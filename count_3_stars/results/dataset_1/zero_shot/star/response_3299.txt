Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are:

<0, (1, 3, 7)>
<1, (0, 4, 8)>
<3, (0, 5, 6)>
<4, (1, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
