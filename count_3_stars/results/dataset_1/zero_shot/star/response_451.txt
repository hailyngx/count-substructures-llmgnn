Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:
- <0, (5, 6, 9)>
- <1, (4, 7, 0)>
- <2, (8, 9, 0)>
- <3, (5, 7, 9)>
- <4, (1, 7, 0)>
- <5, (0, 3, 7)>
- <6, (0, 8, 0)>
- <7, (1, 3, 5)>
- <8, (2, 5, 6)>
- <9, (0, 2, 3)>

Therefore, there are 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The final count is [10].
