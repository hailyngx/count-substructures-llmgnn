Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 3-stars in the given graph. The 3-stars are:

<0, (2, 5, 8)>
<1, (4, 7, 8)>
<2, (0, 5, 8)>
<3, (4, 6, 7)>
<4, (1, 3, 9)>
<5, (0, 2, 8)>
<6, (3, 7, 9)>
<7, (1, 3, 6)>
<8, (0, 1, 5)>
<9, (4, 6, 9)>

So, there are a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
