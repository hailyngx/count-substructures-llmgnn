Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are a total of [2] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 7, 8)>
<9, (2, 4, 6)>
