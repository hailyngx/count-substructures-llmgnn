Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 5 unique 3-stars in this graph.

The 3-stars are:
<4, (0, 1, 2)>
<5, (2, 3, 8)>
<6, (4, 7, 9)>
<7, (1, 4, 5)>
<9, (2, 5, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
