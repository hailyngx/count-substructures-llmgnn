Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8)
