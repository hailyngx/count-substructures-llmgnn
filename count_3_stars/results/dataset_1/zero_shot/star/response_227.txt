Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<1, (0, 4, 8)>
<6, (3, 5, 7)>
<9, (1, 7, 8)>
