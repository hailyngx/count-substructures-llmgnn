Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [18].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<1, (0, 4, 8)>
<2, (0, 5, 6)>
<4, (1, 5, 9)>
<5, (0, 2, 4)>
<6, (0, 2, 3)>
<7, (5, 8, 9)>
<8, (1, 2, 5)>
<9, (1, 4, 5)>
<5, (6, 7, 8)>
