Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9. Let's find the 3-star graphs in this network:

1. <0, (1, 5, 9)>
2. <1, (0, 5, 6)>
3. <3, (4, 5, 9)>
4. <5, (0, 1, 9)>
5. <6, (1, 7, 8)>
6. <9, (0, 3, 5)>

Count of 3-star graphs: [6]
