Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that form 3-star graphs.

- Node 0: (0, 4), (0, 8), (0, 9)
- Node 1: (1, 3), (1, 7)
- Node 2: (2, 7), (2, 9)
- Node 3: (3, 1), (3, 4)
- Node 4: (4, 0), (4, 3), (4, 7), (4, 8)
- Node 5: (5, 6), (5, 7)
- Node 6: (6, 5), (6, 9)
- Node 7: (7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 4), (7, 5)
- Node 8: (8, 0), (8, 4)
- Node 9: (9, 0), (9, 2), (9, 6)

Now, let's list the 3-stars:
<0, (4, 8, 9)>
<1, (3, 7, -)>
<2, (7, 9, -)>
<3, (1, 4, -)>
<4, (0, 3, 8)>
<5, (6, 7, -)>
<6, (5, 9, -)>
<7, (1, 2, 4)>
<8, (0, 4, -)>
<9, (0, 2, 6)>

Counting all the unique 3-stars listed above, we have a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
