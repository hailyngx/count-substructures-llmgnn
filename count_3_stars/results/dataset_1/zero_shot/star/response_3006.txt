Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].  
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:  
<0, (2, 8, 9)>  
<1, (2, 7, 9)>  
<2, (0, 1, 8)>  
<3, (6, 8, 9)>
