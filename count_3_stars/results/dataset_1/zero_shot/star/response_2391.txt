Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are <0, (4, 6, 1)>, <1, (2, 8, 9)>, <2, (3, 1, 4)>, <3, (2, 4, 5)>, <4, (0, 2, 3)>, <5, (4, 6, 7)>, <6, (0, 4, 5)>, <7, (5, 6, 8)>, <8, (1, 4, 7)>, <9, (1, 5, 10)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [10].
