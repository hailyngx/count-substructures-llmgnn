Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
There are 3-stars in the given graph. The number of 3-stars is [4].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (4, 6, 7)>
<1, (7, 8, 9)>
<2, (3, 7, 4)>
<6, (0, 4, 8)>
