Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are [2] 3-stars in the given graph.  
The unique 3-stars are:  
<0, (1, 8, 9)>  
<1, (0, 4, 5)>
