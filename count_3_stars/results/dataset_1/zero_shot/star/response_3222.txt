Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are:

<0, (5, 8, 9)>
<8, (2, 4, 7)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
