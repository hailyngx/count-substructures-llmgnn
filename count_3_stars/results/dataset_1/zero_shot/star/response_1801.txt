Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are a total of 3 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are listed within <>:

<0, (2, 8, 5)>
<3, (6, 8, 4)>
<7, (1, 2, 5)>

Therefore, the final answer is [3].
