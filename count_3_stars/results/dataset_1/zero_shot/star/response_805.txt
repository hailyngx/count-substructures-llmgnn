Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of 3-star configurations in the given graph can be calculated by finding the number of nodes that can act as the central node. 

In this graph, nodes 1, 4, 5, 7, and 9 can all act as the central node of a 3-star configuration. 

Counting the number of 3-star configurations for each central node:
- Node 1: (3, 7, 9) form a 3-star centered at node 1. 
- Node 4: (0, 5, 7) form a 3-star centered at node 4. 
- Node 5: (4, 7, 9) form a 3-star centered at node 5. 
- Node 7: (1, 4, 5) and (6, 9, 1) form 3-stars centered at node 7. 
- Node 9: (2, 5, 6) and (1, 8, 6) form 3-stars centered at node 9. 

Therefore, there are a total of [7] 3-stars in the given graph. 

Unique 3-stars:
<1, (3, 7, 9)>, <4, (0, 5, 7)>, <5, (4, 7, 9)>, <7, (1, 4, 5)>, <7, (6, 9, 1)>, <9, (2, 5, 6)>, <9, (1, 8, 6)>
