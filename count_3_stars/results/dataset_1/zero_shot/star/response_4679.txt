Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [2].

The unique 3-star graphs are:
<0, (3, 8, 9)>
<9, (1, 7, 8)>
