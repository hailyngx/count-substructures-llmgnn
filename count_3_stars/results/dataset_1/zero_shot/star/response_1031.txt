Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (6, 8, 1)>
<1, (2, 6, 9)>
<2, (1, 6, 3)>
<3, (2, 7, 9)>
<6, (0, 1, 5)>
<9, (1, 3, 5)>
