Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are [2] 3-stars in the given graph.
The unique 3-stars are <0, (3, 5, 9)> and <9, (0, 2, 4)>.
