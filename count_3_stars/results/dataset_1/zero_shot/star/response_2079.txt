Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of 3-star subgraphs in the given graph can be calculated by determining the number of nodes that can be at the center of a 3-star. In this case, any node with degree 3 can be at the center of a 3-star.

Based on the given graph, the nodes and their degrees are as follows:
- Node 0: degree 3
- Node 1: degree 4
- Node 2: degree 3
- Node 3: degree 3
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 1
- Node 8: degree 5
- Node 9: degree 4

Therefore, the nodes that can be at the center of a 3-star are nodes 0, 2, 3, and 8. 

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<0, (5, 6, 9)>
<2, (1, 3, 9)>
<3, (1, 2, 8)>
<8, (1, 4, 5)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we find that there are [4] 3-stars in total.
