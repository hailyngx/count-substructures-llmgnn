Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph represents the relationships between the nodes. To find the 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify the central node and its three connected nodes. Let's go ahead and identify the 3-stars:

1. <0, (4, 8, 1)>
2. <1, (8, 0, 8)>
3. <2, (6, 8, 9)>
4. <3, (4, 7, 4)>
5. <4, (0, 3, 7)>
6. <5, (8, 8, 8)>
7. <6, (2, 2, 2)>
8. <7, (4, 9, 4)>
9. <8, (0, 1, 2)>
10. <9, (2, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
