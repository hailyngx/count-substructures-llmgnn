Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be calculated as follows:

1. Identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes: nodes 0, 1, 4, 6, 7, and 9.
2. For each of these nodes, check if they are connected in a way that forms a 3-star.

Analyzing each eligible node:

- Node 0: <0, (5, 6, 7)>
- Node 1: <1, (2, 3, 4)>
- Node 4: <4, (1, 3, 9)>
- Node 6: <6, (0, 5, 8)>
- Node 7: <7, (0, 1, 8)>
- Node 9: <9, (4, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
