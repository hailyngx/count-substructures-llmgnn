Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are:

[<2, (4, 7, 9)>, <5, (3, 8, 8)>] 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
