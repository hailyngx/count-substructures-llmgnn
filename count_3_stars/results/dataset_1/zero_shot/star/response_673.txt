Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
The 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 7, 8)>
<1, (0, 2, 7)>
<3, (6, 9, 5)>
<9, (3, 5, 6)>

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
