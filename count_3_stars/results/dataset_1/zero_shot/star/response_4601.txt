Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph:
<0, (2, 5, 8)>
<1, (2, 5, 9)>
<2, (0, 1, 8)>
<3, (2, 4, 9)>
<4, (3, 8, 9)>
<5, (0, 1, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
