Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 3-star configurations in the given graph. The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (6, 5, 9)>
<1, (4, 2, 9)>
<2, (4, 5, 8)>
<3, (7, 9, 1)>  

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
