Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are:

1. <1, (2, 6, 9)>
2. <2, (1, 6, 9)>
3. <6, (1, 2, 8)>
4. <8, (3, 4, 9)>

Therefore, the final count of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
