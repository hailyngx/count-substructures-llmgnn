Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 5 unique 3-star subgraphs in the given graph. Here they are:

<0, (3, 4, 8)>
<4, (0, 1, 6)>
<7, (1, 2, 5)>
<8, (0, 7, 9)>
<9, (6, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
