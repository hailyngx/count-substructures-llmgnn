Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<0, (5, 6, 7)>
<0, (6, 7, 4)>
