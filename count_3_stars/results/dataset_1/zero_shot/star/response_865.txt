Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are five 3-stars in the given graph. Here are the unique 3-stars found:

<0, (1, 8, 9)>
<2, (4, 6, 9)>
<3, (5, 8, 9)>
<4, (2, 5, 6)>
<7, (1, 2, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
