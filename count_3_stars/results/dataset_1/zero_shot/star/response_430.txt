Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (3, 6, 8)>
<2, (0, 6, 9)>
<3, (1, 6, 9)>
<6, (1, 2, 3)>
<6, (1, 3, 8)>
<6, (2, 3, 5)>
<6, (3, 1, 2)>
<8, (1, 4, 6)>
