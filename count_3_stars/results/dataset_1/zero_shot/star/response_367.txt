Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 1) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 0) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 3 unique 3-stars in the given graph: 
<0, (2, 6, 8)>
<1, (2, 3, 5)>
<8, (0, 4, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
