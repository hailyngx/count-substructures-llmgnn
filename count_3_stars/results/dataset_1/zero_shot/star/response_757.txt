Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (2, 8, 5)>
<3, (4, 5, 7)>
<3, (5, 7, 9)>
<9, (5, 7, 3)>
