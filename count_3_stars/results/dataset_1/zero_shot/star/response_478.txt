Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
    
    Unique 3-stars:
    <0, (2, 4, 7)>
    <1, (5, 9, 4)>
    <2, (0, 4, 9)>
    <4, (0, 2, 9)>
    <5, (1, 3, 9)>
    <9, (1, 4, 8)>
