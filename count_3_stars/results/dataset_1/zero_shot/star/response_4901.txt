Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 2) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars: 
<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<1, (6, 7, 8)>
<2, (8, 9, 1)>
<3, (4, 6, 0)>
