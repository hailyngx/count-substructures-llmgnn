Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 3-star structures in the given graph. The total number of 3-stars is [5].

Unique 3-stars:
<1, (2, 3, 5)>
<3, (1, 5, 7)>
<5, (1, 3, 6)>
<6, (5, 7, 9)>
<7, (3, 5, 6)>
