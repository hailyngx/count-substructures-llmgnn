Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 8 different 3-stars in the given graph. The unique 3-stars are:

<0, (2, 3, 7)>
<1, (6, 7, 9)>
<2, (0, 4, 3)>
<3, (0, 4, 5)>
<4, (2, 3, 9)>
<6, (1, 7, 8)>
<7, (0, 1, 6)>
<9, (1, 3, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
