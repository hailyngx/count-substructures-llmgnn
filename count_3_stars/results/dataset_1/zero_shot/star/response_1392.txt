Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in this graph.  
The unique 3-stars are:  
<0, (5, 1, 2)>  
<1, (3, 4, 7)>  
<2, (5, 7, 6)>  
<3, (1, 6, 7)>  
<4, (1, 7, 5)>  
<6, (3, 7, 9)>
