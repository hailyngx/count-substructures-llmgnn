Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The list is as follows:

<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<0, (3, 5, 9)>
<1, (0, 7, 9)>
<3, (0, 4, 7)>
<5, (0, 6, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
