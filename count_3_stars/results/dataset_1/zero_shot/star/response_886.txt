Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 6 3-star graphs in the given graph. Here they are:

<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<3, (0, 7, 9)>
<4, (1, 5, 8)>
<6, (1, 2, 3)>
<7, (2, 3, 6)>
<8, (1, 4, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
