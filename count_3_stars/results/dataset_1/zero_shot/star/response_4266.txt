Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are listed inside <>:
<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<0, (2, 5, 6)>
<0, (4, 5, 9)>
<2, (0, 5, 6)>
<6, (2, 4, 9)>
Therefore, the final count of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
