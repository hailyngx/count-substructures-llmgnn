Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The final answer is [6].
The unique 3-stars found are <0, (4, 8, 9)>, <1, (3, 7, 2)>, <2, (5, 7, 9)>, <3, (1, 5, 8)>, <5, (3, 8, 9)>, and <8, (3, 5, 6)>.
