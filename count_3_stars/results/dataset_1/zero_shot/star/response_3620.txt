Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The 3-stars are:
<1, (2, 5, 6)>
<2, (1, 5, 7)>
<3, (7, 9, 6)>
<4, (0, 8, 9)>
