Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 7) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 1) 

Response:
There are [2] 3-stars in the given graph.  
The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (2, 7, 8)>
<2, (1, 4, 6)>
