Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 0) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [10] 3-star subgraphs in the given graph.  
The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 5, 7)>
<0, (4, 7, 9)>
<1, (3, 4, 2)>
<2, (4, 7, 9)>
<3, (1, 4, 2)>
<4, (0, 1, 2)>
<5, (0, 7, 9)>
<7, (0, 2, 9)>
<9, (0, 2, 7)>
