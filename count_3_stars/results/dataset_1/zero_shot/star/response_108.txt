Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

The 3-stars are:
<0, (6, 9, 1)>
<3, (1, 8, 9)>
<6, (0, 5, 7)>
<9, (0, 3, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [4].
