Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<1, (0, 5, 8)>
<3, (0, 6, 9)>
<4, (0, 7, 9)>
<6, (0, 9, 9)>
<8, (1, 9, 1)>
<9, (3, 6, 8)>
<9, (6, 8, 9)>
<9, (8, 9, 3)>
