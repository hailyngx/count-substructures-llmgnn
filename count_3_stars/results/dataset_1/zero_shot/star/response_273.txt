Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [7] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 6, 7)>
<1, (2, 5, 6)>
<1, (4, 5, 6)>
<1, (5, 6, 8)>
<4, (1, 6, 7)>
<5, (1, 2, 3)>
<5, (2, 3, 7)>
