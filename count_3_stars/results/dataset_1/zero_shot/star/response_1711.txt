Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph, which can be described as follows:

1. <0, (2, 3, 5)>
2. <1, (3, 5, 6)>
3. <4, (5, 8, -)>
4. <6, (1, 2, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
