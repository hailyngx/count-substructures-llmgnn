Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 0) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated by counting the number of times a node is the center of a 3-star. The degree of a node in a 3-star is exactly 3.

Let's start by identifying the nodes and their degrees in the given graph:
- Node 0 has a degree of 5
- Node 1 has a degree of 3
- Node 2 has a degree of 3
- Node 3 has a degree of 6
- Node 4 has a degree of 4
- Node 5 has a degree of 4
- Node 6 has a degree of 2
- Node 7 has a degree of 5
- Node 8 has a degree of 2
- Node 9 has a degree of 1

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars in the graph now.

1. For node 0, there are (5 choose 3) = 10 ways to pick 3 connections out of 5, creating 10 unique 3-stars with node 0 as the center.
2. Node 1 and node 2 cannot be the center of a 3-star as their degrees are less than 3.
3. For node 3, there are (6 choose 3) = 20 ways to pick 3 connections out of 6, creating 20 unique 3-stars with node 3 as the center.
4. Node 4 has a degree of 4, so it can form 1 unique 3-star with the nodes it is connected to.
5. Node 5 has a degree of 4, so it can form 1 unique 3-star with the nodes it is connected to.
6. Node 6 and node 8 cannot be the center of a 3-star as their degrees are less than 3.
7. Node 7 has a degree of 5, so it can form 1 unique 3-star with the nodes it is connected to.
8. Node 9 cannot be the center of a 3-star as its degree is less than 3.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10 + 20 + 1 + 1 + 1] = [33].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<3, (0, 2, 5)>
<3, (1, 4, 7)>
