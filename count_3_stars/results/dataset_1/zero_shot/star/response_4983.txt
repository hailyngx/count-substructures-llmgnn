Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 9) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are in the format <center, (leaf1, leaf2, leaf3)>:
  
  1. <1, (0, 7, 7)>
  2. <2, (4, 8, 8)>
  3. <4, (2, 3, 8)>
  4. <9, (5, 7, 7)>

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
