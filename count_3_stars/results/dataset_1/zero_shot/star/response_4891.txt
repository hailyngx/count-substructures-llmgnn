Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
In this graph, the 3-stars can be identified by finding the central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Here are the unique 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (2, 5, 8)>
<1, (2, 6, 8)>
<2, (0, 1, 5)>
<2, (5, 8, 0)>
<4, (7, 8, 6)>
<6, (1, 7, 8)>
<7, (4, 6, 8)>
<8, (2, 5, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
