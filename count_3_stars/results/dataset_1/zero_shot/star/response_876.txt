Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are four 3-stars in the given graph. 
The 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 7, 8)>
<1, (0, 5, 8)>
<3, (2, 5, 7)>
<6, (3, 4, 8)> 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [4].
