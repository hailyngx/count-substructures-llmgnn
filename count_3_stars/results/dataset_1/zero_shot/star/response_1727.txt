Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

```
0 --- 9
|     |
|     |
9 --- 4 --- 2
      |     |
      |     |
      5 --- 3
      |
      |
      8 --- 1
      |     |
      |     |
      7 --- 6
```

To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to find all instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

There are 7 total 3-stars in this graph. Here they are listed uniquely:

[<4, (2, 5, 9)>, <8, (1, 5, 7)>, <9, (0, 4, 7)>, <7, (1, 6, 8)>, <1, (7, 8, 8)>, <5, (3, 4, 8)>, <0, (9, 9, 4)>]
