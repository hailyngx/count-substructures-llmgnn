Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Thus, the final answer is [4].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 6, 7)>
<2, (0, 3, 4)>
<3, (2, 5, 7)>
<4, (1, 2, 8)>
