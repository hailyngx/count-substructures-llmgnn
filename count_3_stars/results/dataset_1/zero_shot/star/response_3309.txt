Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are a total of [4] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 3, 7)>
<1, (0, 3, 5)>
<3, (0, 1, 5)>
<6, (1, 4, 7)>
