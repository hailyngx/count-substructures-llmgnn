Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are as follows:

[<0, (1, 2, 9)>, <1, (0, 3, 5)>, <2, (0, 5, 7)>, <3, (1, 6, 7)>, <4, (6, 8, 9)>, <5, (1, 2, 6)>, <6, (3, 4, 9)>, <7, (2, 3, 8)>, <8, (1, 4, 7)>, <9, (0, 4, 6)>]

There are 10 unique 3-stars in total. Therefore, the final answer is [10].
