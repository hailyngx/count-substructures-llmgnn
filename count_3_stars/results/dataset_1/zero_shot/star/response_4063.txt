Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (2, 0) (3, 0) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The 3-stars are:
    - <0, (2, 3, 7)>
    - <5, (6, 7, 8)>
    - <6, (5, 8, 7)>
    - <8, (5, 6, 7)>
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
