Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph. 

<0, (1, 8, 9)>
<1, (0, 5, 6)>
<2, (0, 4, 6)>
<6, (1, 2, 8)>
<7, (3, 4, 8)>
<8, (0, 1, 6)>
