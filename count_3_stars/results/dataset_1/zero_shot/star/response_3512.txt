Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are:

<0, (5, 9, 1)>
<5, (0, 2, 4)>
<1, (4, 5, 9)>
<9, (0, 2, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
