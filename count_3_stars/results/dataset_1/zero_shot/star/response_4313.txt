Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

In this graph, the possible 3-stars are:
- <0, (1, 3, 7)>
- <0, (1, 8, 9)>
- <2, (5, 8, 9)>
- <3, (0, 4, 7)>
- <4, (3, 7, 9)>
- <7, (0, 4, 9)>
- <8, (0, 2, 9)>
- <9, (0, 2, 6)>

Thus, there are 8 unique 3-stars in the graph. So, the final answer is [8].
