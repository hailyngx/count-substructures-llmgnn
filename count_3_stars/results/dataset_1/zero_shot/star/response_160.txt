Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].

<1, (5, 7, 8)>
<4, (6, 8, 9)>
<5, (1, 8, 9)>
<6, (4, 9, 8)>
<7, (1, 3, 8)>
<8, (1, 4, 5)>
<8, (5, 4, 9)>
<9, (6, 8, 9)>
