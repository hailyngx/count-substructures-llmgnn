Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.  

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (7, 8, 5)>
<1, (3, 4, 9)>
<4, (1, 3, 5)>
<7, (0, 8, 6)>
