Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The 3-star graphs present in the given graph are as follows:  
[<0, (5, 1, 7)>, <1, (5, 0, 9)>, <2, (4, 6, 8)>, <3, (6, 8, 9)>, <4, (2, 6, 8)>, <5, (0, 1, 7)>, <6, (2, 3, 7)>, <7, (1, 5, 6)>, <8, (2, 3, 6)>, <9, (1, 3, 7)>]  
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
