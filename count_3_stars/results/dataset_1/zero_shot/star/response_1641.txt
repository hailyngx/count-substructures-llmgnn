Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:
    
[<0, (7, 9)>]

[<1, (3, 5, 6)>]

[<2, (4, 7, 9)>]

[<4, (2, 5, X)>]

[<6, (1, 7, 8)>]

[<7, (0, 2, 6)>]

[<9, (0, 2, X)>]

There are a total of [7] 3-stars in the given graph.
