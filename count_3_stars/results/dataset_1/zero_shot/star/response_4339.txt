Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in this graph is [9].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<1, (0, 6, 9)>
<3, (7, 9, 6)>
<4, (0, 8, 5)>
<5, (0, 9, 4)>
<6, (1, 9, 7)>
<7, (3, 6, 9)>
<8, (4, 9, 0)>
<9, (0, 1, 3)>
