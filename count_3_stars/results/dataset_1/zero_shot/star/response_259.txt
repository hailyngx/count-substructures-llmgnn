Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 3) (3, 2) (4, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are two 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 6, 9)>
<6, (0, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
