Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (2, 4, 8)>
<3, (7, 6, 9)>
<4, (1, 8, 5)>
<6, (7, 8, 9)>
<7, (3, 6, 9)>
<8, (4, 5, 6)>
<9, (3, 6, 7)>
