Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of [4] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (6, 9, 1)>
<3, (1, 2, 4)>
<4, (2, 3, 8)>
<6, (0, 7, 8)>
