Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) 

Response:
There are four 3-stars in the graph. Here are the unique 3-stars found within <> brackets:

<0, (2, 3, 5)>
<1, (2, 3, 7)>
<2, (0, 1, 5)>
<3, (0, 1, 5)>

So, the total count of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
