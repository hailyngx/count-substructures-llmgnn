Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (4, 1) (4, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [8] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 2, 8)>
<1, (0, 4, 6)>
<2, (0, 1, 7)>
<4, (1, 9, X)>
<6, (1, 7, X)>
<7, (2, 6, 9)>
<8, (1, X, X)>
<9, (1, 4, 7)>
