Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The 3-stars are as follows:

<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<2, (1, 7, 9)>
<3, (0, 8, 9)>
<5, (0, 4, 9)>

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
