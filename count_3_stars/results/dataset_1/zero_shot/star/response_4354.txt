Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 2) (9, 0) 

Response:
There are 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

The 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 9, 4)>
<2, (8, 7, 1)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [2].
