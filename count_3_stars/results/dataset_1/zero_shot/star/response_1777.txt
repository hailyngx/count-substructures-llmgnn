Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

The 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 7, 8)>
<1, (0, 3, 5)>
<3, (1, 2, 4)>
<7, (0, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
