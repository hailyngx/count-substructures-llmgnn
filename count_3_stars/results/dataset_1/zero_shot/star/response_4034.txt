Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are a total of [10] nodes and [20] edges in the given graph.
    
The 3-star graphs in this graph are:
<0, (2, 4, 8)>
<2, (0, 1, 6)>
<4, (0, 8, -)>
<5, (3, 9, -)>
<6, (2, 8, -)>
<8, (4, 6, 7)>

There are [6] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
