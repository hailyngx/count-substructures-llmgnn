Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (4, 7) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph, and here they are:

<2, (6, 7, 9)>
<7, (1, 4, 8)>
<7, (2, 4, 8)>
<9, (0, 2, 7)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
