Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 10 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (5, 2) (6, 2) (8, 2) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The count is [4].
The unique 3-stars are:
<2, (0, 3, 5)>
<2, (0, 5, 6)>
<2, (0, 3, 8)>
<2, (6, 3, 8)>
