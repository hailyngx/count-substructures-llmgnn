Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are two 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 5, 7)>
<6, (1, 5, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
