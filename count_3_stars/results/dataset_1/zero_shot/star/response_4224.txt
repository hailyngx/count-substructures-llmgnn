Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [3] 3-stars in the given graph.  
<0, (2, 7, 3)>
<1, (3, 5, 6)>
<6, (1, 2, 9)>
