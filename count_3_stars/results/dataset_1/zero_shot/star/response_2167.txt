Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are:

<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<1, (5, 8, 9)>
<3, (7, 8, 2)>
<7, (2, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
