Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12]. The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (3, 6, 7)>
<0, (6, 7, 8)>
<1, (4, 5, 7)>
<2, (5, 6, 9)>
<3, (0, 6, 7)>
<4, (1, 5, 7)>
<5, (2, 4, 7)>
<5, (4, 5, 8)>
<5, (5, 7, 9)>
<6, (0, 3, 4)>
<7, (0, 1, 5)>
<9, (5, 7, 9)>
