Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) 

Response:
There are a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph.

[<0, (1, 2, 5)>, <2, (0, 3, 6)>, <2, (5, 6, 8)>, <5, (0, 2, 8)>, <6, (2, 3, 7)>, <6, (5, 7, 8)>]
