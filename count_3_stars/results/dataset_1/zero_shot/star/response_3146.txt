Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [10] nodes in total and [26] edges in the given graph. 

Let's now find the number of 3-stars in this graph:

Counting the number of 3-stars where each node can act as the center:
- Node 0: (0, 1, 6) and (0, 6, 8) -> <0, (1, 6, 8)> (count: 1)
- Node 1: No 3-stars
- Node 2: No 3-stars
- Node 3: No 3-stars
- Node 4: No 3-stars
- Node 5: No 3-stars
- Node 6: (6, 0, 5), (6, 8, 4) and (6, 9, 3) -> <6, (0, 5, 8)>, <6, (4, 8, 9)>, <6, (3, 8, 9)> (count: 3)
- Node 7: No 3-stars
- Node 8: (8, 4, 6), (8, 6, 9) and (8, 7, 9) -> <8, (4, 6, 9)>, <8, (6, 9, 7)>, <8, (7, 9, 4)> (count: 3)
- Node 9: No 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is therefore [7]. 
The unique 3-stars are: <0, (1, 6, 8)>, <6, (0, 5, 8)>, <6, (4, 8, 9)>, <6, (3, 8, 9)>, <8, (4, 6, 9)>, <8, (6, 9, 7)>, <8, (7, 9, 4)>
