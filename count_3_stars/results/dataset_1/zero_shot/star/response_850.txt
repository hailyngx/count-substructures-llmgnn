Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is 4. 

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (1, 7, 8)>
<1, (0, 3, 6)>
<2, (4, 6, 8)>
<4, (2, 6, 9)>

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
