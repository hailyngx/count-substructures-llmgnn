Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The 3-star graph in this case can be identified by checking the neighbors of each node to see if they form a 3-star pattern. 

After analyzing the provided edges, there are four 3-stars in the given graph. The 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 7, 9)>
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<3, (1, 6, 9)>
<7, (0, 5, 9)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
