Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 6, 8)>
<3, (0, 8, 9)>
<5, (7, 9, 6)>
<7, (1, 5, 2)>
