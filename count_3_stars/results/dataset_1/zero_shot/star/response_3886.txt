Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are a total of [10] nodes and [28] edges in the given graph. Now, let's find the number of 3-stars in this graph.

Based on the definition of a 3-star graph, we need to look for vertices with exactly three incident edges, which form a 3-star configuration.

After analyzing the edges, we can identify the following unique 3-stars in the graph: 
<0, (4, 9, 2)>
<1, (3, 6, 7)>
<2, (4, 9, 0)>
<3, (1, 4, 9)>
<4, (0, 2, 3)>
<6, (1, 4, 5)>
<7, (1, 5, 11)>
<9, (0, 2, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
