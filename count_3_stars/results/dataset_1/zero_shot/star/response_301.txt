Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are [3] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 3, 5)>
<1, (5, 8, 9)>
<2, (5, 6, 7)>
