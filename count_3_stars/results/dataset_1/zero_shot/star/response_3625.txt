Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are a total of 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are along with their nodes:
    
    - <0, (2, 4, 1)>
    - <5, (3, 4, 7)>
    - <2, (0, 3, 6)>
    - <8, (2, 5, 9)>
    
So, the final answer is [4].
