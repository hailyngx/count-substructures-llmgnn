Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (3, 7) (4, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are a total of [3] 3-stars in the given graph. Here are the unique 3-stars:
   
<0, (1, 2, 7)>
<1, (0, 7, 8)>
<7, (0, 1, 3)>
