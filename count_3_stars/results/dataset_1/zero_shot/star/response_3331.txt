Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
The 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 4, 7)>
<3, (0, 6, 9)>
<4, (0, 6, -)>
<6, (3, 4, 8)>
<7, (0, 1, 2)>

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
