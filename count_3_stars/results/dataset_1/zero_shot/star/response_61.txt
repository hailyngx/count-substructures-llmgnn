Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:

\[<0, (2, 4, 7)>, <1, (2, 6, 9)>, <2, (0, 1, 7)>, <6, (1, 3, 9)> \]

Hence, there are a total of [4] 3-stars in the graph.
