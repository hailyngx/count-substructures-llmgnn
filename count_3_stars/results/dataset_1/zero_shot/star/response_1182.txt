Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:
- <0, (1, 8, 8)>
- <1, (0, 2, 4)>
- <2, (1, 7, 9)>
- <8, (0, 3, 5)>
- <9, (2, 5, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
