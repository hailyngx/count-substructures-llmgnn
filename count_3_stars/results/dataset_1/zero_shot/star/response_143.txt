Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].

<0, (2, 5, 8)>
<1, (2, 6, _)>
<2, (0, 1, 9)>
<4, (6, 8, 9)>
