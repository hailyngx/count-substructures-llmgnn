Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The central node in each 3-star should have exactly 3 neighbors. This condition can be met for nodes 2, 3, and 7 from the given graph. Thus, we will generate the 3-stars from these central nodes.

For node 2:
- <2, (1, 4, 5)>
- <2, (7, 8, 1)>

For node 3:
- <3, (0, 4, 9)>
- <3, (2, 0, 9)>

For node 7:
- <7, (5, 1, 9)>
- <7, (5, 2, 6)>
- <7, (5, 6, 9)>
- <7, (2, 5, 9)>

Counting all unique 3-stars, we find a total of [7].
