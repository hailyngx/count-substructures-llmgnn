Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes of the 3-stars in the graph. Since each central node is connected to exactly three other nodes, we need to find nodes with degree 3. In this case, nodes 2, 4, 7, and 8 are potential central nodes.

Let's confirm the 3-stars involving these central nodes:
1. For node 2: (2, 0, 3, 4) is a 3-star.
2. For node 4: (4, 0, 1, 7) is a 3-star.
3. For node 7: (7, 4, 5, 8) is a 3-star.
4. For node 8: (8, 4, 6, 9) is a 3-star.

Counting the unique 3-stars, we find a total of four 3-stars. 
Therefore, the answer is [4] and the unique 3-stars are <2, (0, 3, 4)>, <4, (0, 1, 7)>, <7, (4, 5, 8)>, <8, (4, 6, 9)>.
