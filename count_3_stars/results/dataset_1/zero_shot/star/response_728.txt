Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are as follows:
<0, (6, 7, 1)>
<1, (3, 9, 8)>
<1, (6, 0, 2)>
<3, (1, 9, 5)>
<4, (3, 9, 8)>
<7, (0, 2, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
