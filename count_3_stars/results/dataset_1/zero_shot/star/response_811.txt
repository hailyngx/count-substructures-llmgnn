Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 8, 9)>
<3, (4, 7, 8)>
<4, (3, 9, 8)>
<8, (0, 1, 9)>
