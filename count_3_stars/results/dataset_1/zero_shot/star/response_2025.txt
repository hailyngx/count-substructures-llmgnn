Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph: 
1. <0, (2, 5, 6)>
2. <2, (0, 5, 6)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
