Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 5) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be calculated by looking at each node and checking if it forms a 3-star with its neighbors. 

Here's the list of unique 3-stars in the given graph:
<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<2, (1, 5, 6)>
<3, (1, 5, 7)>
<5, (0, 2, 3)>
<8, (1, 5, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
