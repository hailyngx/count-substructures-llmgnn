Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 7) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
   
<0, (1, 2, 9)>
<2, (0, 5, 6)>
<5, (2, 6, 8)>
<7, (3, 5, 8)>
<8, (5, 7, 9)>
<9, (1, 5, 8)>
