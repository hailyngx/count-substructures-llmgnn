Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are four 3-star graphs in the given graph. The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<2, (0, 3, 8)>
<3, (0, 2, 7)>
<5, (3, 6, 9)>
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
