Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 46 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The count of 3-stars is [4].

<0, (2, 3, 5)>
<3, (0, 5, 6)>
<5, (0, 2, 3)>
<6, (2, 3, 9)>
