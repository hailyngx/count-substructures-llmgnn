Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars: 
<0, (1, 8, 9)>
<1, (0, 5, 8)>
<2, (3, 4, 5)>
<4, (2, 8, 9)>
<5, (1, 2, -)>
<8, (0, 4, 6)>
<9, (0, 4, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
