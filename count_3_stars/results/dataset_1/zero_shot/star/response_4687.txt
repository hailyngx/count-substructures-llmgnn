Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:
1. <0, (7, 8, 9)>
2. <2, (1, 3, 8)>
3. <5, (6, 7, 8)>
4. <6, (3, 5, 9)>
5. <7, (0, 5, 8)>
6. <8, (0, 2, 5)>
7. <9, (0, 2, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
