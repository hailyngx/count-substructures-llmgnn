Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
There are [3] 3-star graphs in the given graph.  

The unique 3-star graphs are:  
<0, (3, 6, 1)>  
<4, (7, 8, 6)>  
<9, (2, 1, 0)>
