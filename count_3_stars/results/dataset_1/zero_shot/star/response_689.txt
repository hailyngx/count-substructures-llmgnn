Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-star subgraphs in the given graph. The unique 3-stars are <0, (2, 3, 7)>, <2, (0, 3, 4)>, <3, (0, 2, 4)>, <4, (2, 3, 5)>, <5, (3, 4, 8)>, and <7, (0, 1, 8)>.
