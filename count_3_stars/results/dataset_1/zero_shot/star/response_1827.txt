Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated by counting the number of nodes that can be the center of a 3-star. In this case, any node that has exactly 3 neighbors can be the center of a 3-star.

Let's identify the nodes with 3 neighbors:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors.

Therefore, the nodes that can be the center of a 3-star are nodes 2, 6, and 9.

Let's list the unique 3-stars:
<2, (0, 6, 9)>
<6, (1, 2, 4)>
<9, (0, 2, 7)>

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
