Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (6, 7, 8)>
<1, (3, 8, 2)>
<2, (3, 1, 8)>
<3, (1, 2, 8)>
<5, (6, 9, 7)>
<7, (9, 5, 6)>
