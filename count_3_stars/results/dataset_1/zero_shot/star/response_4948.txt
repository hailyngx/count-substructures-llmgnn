Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 3, 7)>
<0, (2, 3, 8)>
<0, (2, 3, 9)>
<0, (3, 7, 9)>
