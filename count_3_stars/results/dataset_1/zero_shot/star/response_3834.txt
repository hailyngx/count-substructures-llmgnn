Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be counted by looking at each node in the graph and finding how many 3-star configurations it is a part of. Let's find all the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0: <0, (2, 4, 6)>, <0, (3, 4, 9)>
2. Node 2: <2, (0, 5, 7)>
3. Node 3: <3, (0, 4, 9)>
4. Node 4: <4, (0, 3, 5)>
5. Node 5: <5, (2, 3, 8)>
6. Node 7: <7, (2, 8, 9)>
7. Node 8: <8, (5, 7)>
8. Node 9: <9, (0, 3, 7)>

Therefore, there are a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
