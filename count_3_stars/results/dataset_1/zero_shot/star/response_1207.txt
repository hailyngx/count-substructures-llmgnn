Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph. 

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<2, (5, 8, 9)>
<3, (1, 4, 6)>
<4, (3, 5, 7)>
<9, (2, 6, 8)>
