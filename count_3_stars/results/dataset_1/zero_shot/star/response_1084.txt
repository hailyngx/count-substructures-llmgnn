Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (9, 2) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph.  

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<1, (2, 5, 7)>
<2, (0, 1, 6)>
<2, (1, 3, 7)>
<2, (6, 7, 9)>
<7, (1, 5, 6)>
