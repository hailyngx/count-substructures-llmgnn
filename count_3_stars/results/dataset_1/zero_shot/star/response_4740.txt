Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [24], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (5, 9, 2)>
<2, (5, 8, 9)>
<4, (6, 8, 2)>
<6, (4, 8, 7)>
<8, (2, 4, 6)>
<9, (0, 1, 3)>
