Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 5 3-stars in the given graph. Here is the list of unique 3-stars: 
<0, (1, 2, 7)>, 
<1, (0, 3, 4)>, 
<2, (0, 6, 9)>, 
<5, (8, 9, -)>, 
<6, (1, 2, -)>

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
