Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (4, 8) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (0, 2, 8)>
<2, (1, 8, 9)>
<8, (1, 2, 4)>
