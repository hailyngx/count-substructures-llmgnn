Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 7, 8)>
<1, (0, 6, 8)>
<3, (7, 8, 9)>
<4, (5, 8, 9)>
<5, (4, 8, 9)>
<6, (1, 8, 9)>
