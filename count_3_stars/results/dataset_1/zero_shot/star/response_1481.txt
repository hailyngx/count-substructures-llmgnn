Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are [12] 3-stars in the given graph.  
The unique 3-stars are <1, (2, 4, 7)>, <1, (3, 6, 7)>, <1, (4, 6, 7)>, <1, (4, 8, 7)>, <2, (1, 4, 8)>, <3, (1, 4, 6)>, <4, (1, 3, 6)>, <4, (1, 6, 7)>, <4, (2, 3, 6)>, <4, (2, 6, 7)>, <6, (1, 3, 4)>, <6, (1, 4, 7)>
