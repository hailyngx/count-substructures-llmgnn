Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated by finding all instances where a node has exactly three edges connected to it. Let's list all the 3-stars found in the given graph:

<0, (4, 5, 9)>
<1, (2, 4, 5)>
<2, (1, 8, 9)>
<3, (1, 6, 9)>
<4, (0, 1, 5)>
<5, (0, 1, 9)>
<6, (3, 5, 9)>
<7, (1, 5, 9)>
<8, (2, 9, -)>
<9, (0, 2, 3)>

Count of 3-stars: [9]
