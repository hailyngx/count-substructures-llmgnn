Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<1, (0, 7, 9)>
<2, (0, 3, 4)>
<4, (2, 5, 7)>
<8, (0, 1, 9)>
