Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are listed inside <>:
<1, (3, 7, 9)>
<2, (3, 7, 8)>
<3, (1, 2, 5)>
<5, (0, 3, 9)>
<6, (3, 7, 9)>
So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
