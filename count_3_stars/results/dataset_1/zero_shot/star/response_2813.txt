Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:
[<0, (4, 6, 8)>, <0, (4, 6, 9)>, <0, (4, 8, 9)>]
