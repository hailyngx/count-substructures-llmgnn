Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph. The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<2, (1, 7, 9)>
<4, (0, 6, 7)>
<5, (1, 8, 0)>
<7, (0, 2, 8)>
<9, (0, 3, 6)>
