Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 7 unique 3-stars in this graph. Here they are:

<0, (5, 9, 1)>
<2, (1, 4, 6)>
<5, (1, 0, 9)>
<6, (2, 4, 9)>
<7, (2, 3, 8)>
<8, (5, 7, 9)>
<9, (5, 0, 6)>

Therefore, the final answer is [7].
