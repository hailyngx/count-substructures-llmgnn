Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
The 3-stars present in the given graph are:
[<0, (1, 2, 5)>, <0, (1, 6, 8)>]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
