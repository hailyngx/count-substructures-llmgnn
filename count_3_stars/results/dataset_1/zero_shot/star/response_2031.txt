Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The count is as follows: [4]

The 3-stars are:
<2, (1, 6, 7)>
<6, (2, 8, 9)>
<7, (2, 3, 9)>
<8, (6, 9, 3)>
