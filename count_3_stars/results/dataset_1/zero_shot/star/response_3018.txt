Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 6) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
There are 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here is the list of 3-stars:

<0, (3, 6, 7)>
<7, (0, 1, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
