Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 5 3-stars in the given graph. So, the answer is [5].
The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 4, 9)>
<3, (6, 7, 8)>
<4, (0, 9, 7)>
<6, (3, 7, 9)>
<8, (5, 7, 9)>
