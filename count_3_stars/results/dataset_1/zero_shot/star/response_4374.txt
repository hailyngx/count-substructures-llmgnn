Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 10 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (5, 3) (7, 0) (7, 9) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:
```
    1  3
   / \/ \
  0   |  5
   \ / \/
    7   3
         \
          9
```

There are [4] unique 3-stars in this graph.
Here they are: 
<0, (4, 7, 9)>, <3, (1, 5, 7)>, <3, (5, 7, 9)>, <7, (0, 9, 3)>.
