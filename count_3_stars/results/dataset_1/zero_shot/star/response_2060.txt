Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
There are 2 3-stars in the given graph. 
Here are the unique 3-stars found: 
<0, (2, 9, 1)>
<2, (0, 3, 6)> 

Therefore, the final answer is [2].
