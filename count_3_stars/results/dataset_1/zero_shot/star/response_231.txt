Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are <0, (1, 3, 4)>, <2, (3, 5, 9)>, and <7, (3, 5, 6)> as the unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
