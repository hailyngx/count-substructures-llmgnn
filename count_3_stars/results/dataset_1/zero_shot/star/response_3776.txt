Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The 3-stars are:

    <0, (1, 5, 7)>
    <0, (4, 5, 9)>
    <1, (0, 3, 8)>
    <4, (0, 2, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
