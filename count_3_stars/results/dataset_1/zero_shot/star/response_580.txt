Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are listed inside brackets []:

[4]

And the unique 3-stars found are as follows:
<0, (2, 4, 9)>
<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<0, (3, 8, 9)>
<0, (4, 6, 7)>
