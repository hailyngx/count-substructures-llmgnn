Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The central node in each 3-star will be the first node listed in each edge pair. Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <1, (2, 3, 6)>
2. <2, (1, 3, 6)>
3. <3, (1, 2, 7)>
4. <4, (5, 9, 7)>
5. <5, (4, 9, 7)>
6. <6, (2, 7, 1)>
7. <7, (6, 9, 3)>
8. <9, (4, 5, 7)>

The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
