Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 6 total 3-stars in the given graph.
[6]

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<1, (0, 4, 9)>
<2, (0, 4, 6)>
<4, (0, 1, 2)>
<5, (0, 1, 9)>
<6, (2, 4, 5)>
