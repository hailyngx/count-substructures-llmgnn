Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 8 unique 3-stars in this graph. The list of unique 3-stars is as follows:
<0, (1, 6, 9)>
<1, (0, 2, 9)>
<2, (0, 1, 6)>
<3, (1, 9, )>
<4, (2, 7, )>
<5, (7, 9, )>
<6, (0, 2, 9)>
<7, (5, 6, )>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
