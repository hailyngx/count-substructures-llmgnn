Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are a total of 4 3-stars in this given graph. Here is the list of unique 3-stars: 
<0, (3, 5, 8)>
<0, (3, 5, 9)>
<2, (4, 5, 7)>
<4, (2, 5, 7)>

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
