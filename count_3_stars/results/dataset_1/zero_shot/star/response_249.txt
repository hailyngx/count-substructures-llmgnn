Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph.  

The unique 3-stars are:  
<0, (5, 6, 8)>   
<1, (4, 7, 8)>  
<2, (4, 7, 8)>  
<3, (5, 7, 8)>  
<4, (1, 2, 5)>  
<9, (5, 7, 9)>
