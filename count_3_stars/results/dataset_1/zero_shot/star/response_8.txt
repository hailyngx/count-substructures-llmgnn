Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) 

Response:
There are 5 unique 3-stars in this graph. The count of 3-stars is [5].
    
The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 4, 6)>
<0, (3, 6, 7)>
<0, (4, 6, 7)>
<0, (6, 7, 8)>
<0, (0, 8, 9)>
