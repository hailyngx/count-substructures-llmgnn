Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 0) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

The 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<1, (2, 5, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
