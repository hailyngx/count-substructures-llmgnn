Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
There are 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here is the list of the 3-stars:

<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<1, (0, 3, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
