Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (8, 9, 5)>
<1, (2, 3, 8)>
<5, (4, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 1, 5)>
