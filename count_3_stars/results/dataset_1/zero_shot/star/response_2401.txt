Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [7] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (8, 4, 8)>
<1, (3, 4, 8)>
<2, (5, 7, 9)>
<3, (1, 7, 9)>
<4, (1, 8, 4)>
<7, (2, 3, 9)>
<8, (0, 4, 9)>
