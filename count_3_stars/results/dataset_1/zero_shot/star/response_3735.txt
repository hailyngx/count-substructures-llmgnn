Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph contains the following 3-stars:
[<0, (1, 3, 5)>, <3, (0, 2, 6)>, <6, (2, 3, 5)>, <9, (3, 4, 6)>]
There are a total of 4 unique 3-stars in the graph.
