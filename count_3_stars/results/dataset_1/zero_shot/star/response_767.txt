Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph. Here are the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (4, 7, 8)>
<1, (4, 5, 9)>
<2, (3, 7, 8)>
<3, (2, 7, 8)>
<4, (0, 1, 9)>
