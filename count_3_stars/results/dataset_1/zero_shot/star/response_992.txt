Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are two 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 5, 8)>
<3, (6, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
