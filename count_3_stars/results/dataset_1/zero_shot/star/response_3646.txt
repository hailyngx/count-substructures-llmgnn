Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (4, 2, 7)>
<1, (5, 6, 7)>
<2, (4, 7, 8)>
<3, (7, 8, 9)>
<4, (0, 2, 7)>
<5, (1, 6, 7)>
<6, (1, 5, 7)>
<7, (1, 2, 3)>
