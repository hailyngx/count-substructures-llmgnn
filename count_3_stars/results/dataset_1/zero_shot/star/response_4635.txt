Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The number of 3-star structures in the given graph is [2].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<3, (0, 6, 9)>
