Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph can be determined by counting the number of instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

From the given graph, the following 3-stars are found:
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<2, (0, 4, 5)>
<8, (9, 3, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
