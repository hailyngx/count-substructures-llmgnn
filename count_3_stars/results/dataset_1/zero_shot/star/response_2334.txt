Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 5, 6)>
<1, (5, 6, 9)>
<2, (0, 7, 9)>
<6, (0, 1, 5)>
