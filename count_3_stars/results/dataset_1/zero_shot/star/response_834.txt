Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 7, 9)>
<1, (0, 5, 8)>
<2, (3, 4, 8)>
<3, (2, 7, 8)>
<4, (0, 5, 9)>
<5, (0, 1, 4)>
<6, (4, 5, 8)>
<7, (0, 1, 3)>
<8, (1, 2, 6)>
