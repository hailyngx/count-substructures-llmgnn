Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph.  
The unique 3-stars are:  
<1, (2, 4, 5)>  
<1, (7, 4, 9)>  
<1, (5, 6, 9)>  
<3, (2, 6, 9)>  
<4, (1, 6, 9)>  
<6, (3, 4, 5)>
