Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 total 3-stars in the given graph. Here is the list of unique 3-stars:
    <1, (4, 5, 8)>
    
The final answer is [4].
