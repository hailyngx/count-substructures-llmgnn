Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
The 3-star configurations are:
<0, (1, 2, 7)>
<1, (0, 2, 4)>
<2, (0, 1, 9)>
<9, (1, 2, 5)>
The final answer is [4].
