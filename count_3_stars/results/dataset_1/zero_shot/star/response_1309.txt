Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's list the 3-stars present in the given graph:

<0, (2, 3, 6)>
<1, (4, 9, 2)>
<2, (0, 6, 5)>
<4, (1, 6, 9)>
<6, (0, 4, 5)>
<9, (1, 2, 7)>

Since there are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph, the output should be: [6].
