Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<2, (3, 7, 8)>
<5, (0, 6, 7)>
<6, (4, 5, 9)>
<7, (1, 2, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
