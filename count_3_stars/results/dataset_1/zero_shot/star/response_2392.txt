Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) 

Response:
There are a total of [4] 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are:
<0, (1, 6, 8)>
<1, (0, 6, 8)>
<3, (4, 5, 7)>
<4, (2, 3, 8)>
