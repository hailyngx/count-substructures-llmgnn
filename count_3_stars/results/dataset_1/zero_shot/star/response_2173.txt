Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 4 3-stars in the given graph. Here are the unique 3-stars found:

<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<1, (3, 7, 8)>
<2, (0, 4, 5)>
<5, (0, 3, 9)>

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
