Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph. 

Here are the unique 3-stars:
<0, (3, 9, 9)>
<2, (4, 6, 7)>
<4, (2, 7, 8)>
<8, (1, 4, 9)>
