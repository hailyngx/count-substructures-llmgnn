Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
- 0: (4, 5)
- 1: (7)
- 2: (5, 9)
- 3: (8, 9)
- 4: (0)
- 5: (0, 2, 7)
- 6: (7)
- 7: (1, 5, 6)
- 8: (3)
- 9: (2, 3)

To count the number of 3-stars, we look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes by edges, forming a 3-star pattern.

The 3-stars in the given graph are:
[<0, (4, 5, 2)>, <1, (7, 5, 6)>, <2, (5, 9, 3)>, <3, (8, 9, 2)>, <4, (0)>, <5, (0, 2, 7)>, <6, (7)>, <7, (1, 5, 6)>, <8, (3)>, <9, (2, 3)>]

Therefore, there are a total of [10] 3-stars in the graph.
