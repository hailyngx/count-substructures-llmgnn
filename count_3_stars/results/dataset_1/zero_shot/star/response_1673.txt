Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 2 different 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (0, 2, 7)>
<8, (1, 4, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
