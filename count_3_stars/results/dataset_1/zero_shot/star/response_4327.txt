Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars are:
<2, (0, 1, 7)>
<4, (0, 1, 7)>
<5, (1, 3, 9)>
<7, (2, 4, 8)>
<9, (2, 4, 6)>
<9, (4, 5, 7)>
