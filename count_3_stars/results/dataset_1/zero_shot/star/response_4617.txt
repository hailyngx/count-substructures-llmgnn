Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 5 different 3-stars in the given graph.
The 3-stars are as follows: 
<0, (6, 7, 8)>
<1, (3, 6, 0)>
<2, (3, 7, 0)>
<3, (1, 2, 7)>
<7, (0, 2, 9)>
So, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
