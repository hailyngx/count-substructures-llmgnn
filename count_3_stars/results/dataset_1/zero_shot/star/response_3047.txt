Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are a total of [2] 3-star graphs in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars are:  
<0, (8, 4, 6)>  
<2, (1, 3, 5)>
