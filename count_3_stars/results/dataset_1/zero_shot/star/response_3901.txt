Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are a total of 9 three-stars in the given graph. 

Here are the unique 3-stars:
<0, (9, 1, 5)>
<1, (3, 5, 9)>
<2, (3, 6, 9)>
<3, (1, 2, 6)>
<4, (6, 7, 8)>
<5, (1, 7, 9)>
<6, (2, 4, 8)>
<7, (4, 5, 9)>
<8, (4, 5, 6)>

Therefore, the final answer is [9].
