Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The given graph is as follows:
```
    0 --- 3 --- 7 --- 1 --- 4 --- 9
            |           |           |
            9           6           3
                        |           |
                        1           5
                        |           |
                        4           2
```

Followed by the explanation, we can observe that there are two 3-stars in this graph. 
Let's list the unique 3-stars found:
1. <1, (4, 6, 7)>
2. <3, (0, 4, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
