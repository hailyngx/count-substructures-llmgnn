Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are [3] 3-star structures in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<1, (3, 4, 8)>
<2, (4, 5, 7)>
