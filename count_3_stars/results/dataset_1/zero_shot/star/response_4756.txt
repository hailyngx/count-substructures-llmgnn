Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
The given graph can be visualized as follows:

```
   1---3      7---5
  /|\         |  /|
 0 | 2        | / |
  \|/         |/  |
   6          4---8
              |
              9
```

To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we first identify all the possible 3-stars based on the given edges:
1. <0, (1, 2, 3)>
2. <0, (6, 9, 4)>
3. <1, (0, 3, 8)>
4. <4, (9, 6, 7)>
5. <5, (7, 8, 0)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
