Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be calculated by examining the central nodes and their adjacent nodes. Let's list the 3-stars and their central nodes:

<1, (2, 3, 5)>
<2, (1, 6, 7)>
<3, (1, 4, 9)>
<4, (3, 8)>
<5, (1)>
<6, (2)>
<7, (1, 2, 8)>
<8, (0, 2, 4, 7, 9)>
<9, (3, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
