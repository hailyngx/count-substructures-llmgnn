Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) 

Response:
The given graph can be visualized as follows:
```
    0 --- 2
   /|     |
  7 |     5
   \|   / | \
    1 - 4  6 7
     \     /
      3   /
         /
```

Let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph:
1. Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 7, 1: <0, (2,7,1)>
2. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 5, 7: <1, (4,5,7)>
3. Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 3, 5: <2, (0,3,5)>
4. Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 4, 6: <5, (1,4,6)>
5. Node 5 forms another 3-star with nodes 2, 4, 7: <5, (2,4,7)>
6. Node 5 forms yet another 3-star with nodes 1, 6, 7: <5, (1,6,7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
