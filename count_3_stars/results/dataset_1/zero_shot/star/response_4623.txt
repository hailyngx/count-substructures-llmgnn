Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 3-star structures in the given graph. Here is the count and the unique 3-stars identified:
[6]

<0, (2, 4, 8)>
<2, (0, 4, 3)>
<4, (0, 2, 6)>
<6, (3, 4, 8)>
<8, (0, 6, 9)>
<9, (6, 8, 0)>
