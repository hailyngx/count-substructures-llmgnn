Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in this graph is [3].  
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:  
<0, (1, 9, 0)>  
<1, (0, 5, 7)>  
<7, (1, 3, 6)>
