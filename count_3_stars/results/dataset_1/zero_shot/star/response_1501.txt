Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are:

<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<2, (0, 3, 7)>
<4, (5, 7, 9)>
<5, (0, 4, 9)>

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
