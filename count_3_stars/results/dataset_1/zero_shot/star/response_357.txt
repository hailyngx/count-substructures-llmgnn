Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
    <0, (2, 8, 9)>
    <1, (3, 5, 4)>
    <5, (1, 4, 8)>
    <7, (6, 8, 9)>
