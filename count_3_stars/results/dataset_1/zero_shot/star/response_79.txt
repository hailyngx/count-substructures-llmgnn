Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph. 

<0, (3, 7, 1)>
<1, (3, 5, 6)>
<3, (0, 1, 5)>
<6, (1, 2, 8)>
