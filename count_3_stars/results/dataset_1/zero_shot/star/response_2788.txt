Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 1) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are a total of [7] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-star configurations are:
<0, (1, 4, 8)>
<1, (0, 5, 6)>
<4, (0, 3, 9)>
<8, (0, 1, 9)>
<9, (0, 2, 4)>
<2, (9, 0, 0)>
<3, (4, 0, 9)>
