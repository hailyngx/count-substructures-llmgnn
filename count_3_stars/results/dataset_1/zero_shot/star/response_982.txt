Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There is one 3-star in the given graph. The unique 3-star is:

<0, (4, 9, 1)>

Therefore, the final answer is [1].
