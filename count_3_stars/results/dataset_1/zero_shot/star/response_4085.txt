Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
There are 3 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The answer is [3].
The unique 3-stars are <0, (2, 4, 6)>, <1, (5, 8, 9)>, and <6, (0, 1, 7)>.
