Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (5, 6, 9)>
<1, (3, 4, 5)>
<1, (5, 6, 7)>
<1, (5, 6, 8)>
<1, (6, 7, 9)>
<1, (6, 8, 9)>
