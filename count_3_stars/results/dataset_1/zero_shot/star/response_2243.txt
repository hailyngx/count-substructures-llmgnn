Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 5) (8, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 6, 8)>
<2, (0, 4, 5)>
<5, (1, 2, 6)>
