Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are [8] 3-stars in the given graph.  

<0, (7, 8, 1)>
<1, (7, 5, 2)>
<2, (5, 8, 1)>
<3, (4, 5, 8)>
<4, (3, 5, 9)>
<5, (1, 2, 8)>
<6, (9, 4, 5)>
