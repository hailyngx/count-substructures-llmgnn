Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4]. The unique 3-stars are <0, (1, 4, 6)>, <1, (0, 3, 8)>, <3, (0, 1, 9)>, and <5, (2, 4, 8)>.
