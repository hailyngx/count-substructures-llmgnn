Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 3-star graphs in the given graph. Here is the list of unique 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (1, 4, 8)>
<1, (0, 4, 9)>
<2, (5, 6, -)>
<3, (4, 5, 6)>
<4, (0, 1, 3)>
<5, (2, 3, 4)>
<6, (2, 3, 7)>
<7, (6, -, -)>
<8, (0, 1, 6)>
<9, (1, 4, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [10].
