Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 9) (7, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph.  
The 3-stars are <0, (2, 3, 7)> and <3, (1, 4, 8)>.  
Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
