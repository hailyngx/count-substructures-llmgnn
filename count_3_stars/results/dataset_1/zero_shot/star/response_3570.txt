Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The 3-star graphs in this given graph are:
[<0, (3, 8, 9)>, <1, (3, 4, 5)>, <2, (3, 4, 8)>, <3, (0, 1, 2)>, <4, (1, 2, 5)>, <5, (1, 4, 7)>, <6, (3, 7, 9)>, <7, (1, 5, 6)>, <8, (0, 2, 4)>, <9, (0, 6, 7)>]
Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
