Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) (4, 1) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (6, 7, 1)>
<1, (2, 4, 5)>
<5, (6, 1, 9)>
<6, (0, 5, 8)>
<7, (0, 2, 9)>
<9, (5, 7, 1)>
