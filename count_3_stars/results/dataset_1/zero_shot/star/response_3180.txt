Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in this graph. 

Here they are:
1. <1, (2, 4, 5)>
2. <2, (1, 3, 5)>
3. <3, (2, 4, 9)>
4. <5, (0, 1, 2)>

Therefore, there are a total of [4] 3-stars in the given graph.
