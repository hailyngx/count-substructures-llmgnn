Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 3 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are:
<1, (2, 3, 6)>
<2, (1, 5, 7)>
<5, (2, 3, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
