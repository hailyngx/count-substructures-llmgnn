Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.  

The unique 3-stars are:
<2, (3, 4, 5)>
<3, (2, 8, 8)>
<4, (2, 7, 7)>
<8, (3, 5, 9)>
