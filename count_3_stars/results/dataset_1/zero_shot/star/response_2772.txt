Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 3) (5, 8) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [3] 3-stars in the given graph.  

The unique 3-stars identified in the graph are:  
<0, (2, 8, 9)>  
<1, (2, 0, 9)>  
<9, (0, 1, 6)>
