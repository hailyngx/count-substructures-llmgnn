Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The given graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

1. Node 0: <0, (4, 7, 9)>
2. Node 1: <1, (5, 8, 2)>
3. Node 2: <2, (5, 7, 8)>
4. Node 3: <3, (8, 9, 2)>
5. Node 4: <4, (0, 5, 9)>
6. Node 5: <5, (1, 2, 4)>
7. Node 6: No 3-star (degree 1)
8. Node 7: <7, (0, 2, 9)>
9. Node 8: <8, (1, 2, 3)>
10. Node 9: <9, (0, 2, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
