Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are listed inside <>:
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<0, (6, 7, 8)>
<1, (0, 5, 7)>
<2, (0, 8, 9)>
<4, (6, 8, )>
<5, (1, 7, 8)>
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
