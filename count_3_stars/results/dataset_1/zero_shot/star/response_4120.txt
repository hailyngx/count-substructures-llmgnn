Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [2] 3-stars in the given graph. The unique 3-stars are <0, (3, 5, 7)> and <4, (1, 7, 8)>.
