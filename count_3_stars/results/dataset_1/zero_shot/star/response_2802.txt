Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 3 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
The 3-stars are: 

<0, (2, 3, 6)>
<3, (0, 2, 4)>
<8, (3, 5, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
