Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph. 

<0, (6, 9, 2)>
<3, (2, 4, 8)>
<3, (7, 5, 4)>
<3, (8, 7, 5)>
<4, (9, 6, 0)>
<4, (6, 2, 3)>
