Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {3, 8}
- Node 1: Neighbors {2, 3, 4, 7}
- Node 2: Neighbors {1, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 1, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 7, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {6, 8, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors {3, 5}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {2, 4, 5, 7, 8}

Next, we'll identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors {2, 4, 7}.
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with neighbors {1, 7, 9}.
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with neighbors {1, 7, 9}.
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with neighbors {6, 8, 9}.
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with neighbors {1, 4, 9}.
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with neighbors {4, 5, 7}.

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is [6].
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<1, (2, 4, 7)>, 
<3, (1, 7, 9)>, 
<4, (1, 7, 9)>, 
<5, (6, 8, 9)>, 
<7, (1, 4, 9)>, 
<9, (4, 5, 7)>.
