Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 7}
- Node 1: {2, 7}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 4, 8}
- Node 3: {4, 5, 8}
- Node 4: {2, 3, 6, 9}
- Node 5: {3}
- Node 6: {4}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 8}
- Node 8: {2, 3, 7}
- Node 9: {4}

Next, we'll identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of:
- Node 2, 4, and 8 have 4, 4, and 3 neighbors respectively. 
- Total number of 3-stars: inom{4}{3} + inom{4}{3} + inom{3}{3} = 4 + 4 + 1 = 9 

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9], and the unique 3-stars are:
- <2, (0, 1, 4)>
- <4, (2, 3, 6)>
- <8, (2, 3, 7)>
