Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 4, 6, 9
- Node 2: 0, 5, 7
- Node 3: 0, 4, 5, 9
- Node 4: 0, 3, 5
- Node 5: 2, 3, 4, 8
- Node 6: 0
- Node 7: 2, 8, 9
- Node 8: 5, 7
- Node 9: 0, 3, 7

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 and Node 3 have 5 neighbors each.
- Node 2, Node 4, and Node 5 have 4 neighbors each.
- Node 7 and Node 9 have 3 neighbors each.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 and Node 3 have \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars each.
- Node 2, Node 4, and Node 5 have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each.
- Node 7 and Node 9 have \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star each.
    
Adding these up: 
\[ [ 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 ] = [34] \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 34.

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (2, 3, 6)>
- <3, (0, 4, 9)>
- <2, (0, 5, 7)>
- <4, (0, 3, 5)>
- <5, (2, 3, 8)>
- <7, (2, 5, 8)>
- <9, (0, 3, 7)>
