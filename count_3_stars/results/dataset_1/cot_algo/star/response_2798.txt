Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The graph can be presented as follows:

         0 -- 6
         | 
         1 -- 4
         |    | \
         9 -- 5 -- 8
          \    | /
            2 -- 3 -- 7

Let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 2: (3, 7, 8)  
Node 3: (2, 4, 7)  
Node 4: (1, 3, 8)  
Node 5: (4, 8, 9)  

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [4] and the unique 3-stars found are <2, (3, 7, 8)>, <3, (2, 4, 7)>, <4, (1, 3, 8)>, <5, (4, 8, 9)>.
