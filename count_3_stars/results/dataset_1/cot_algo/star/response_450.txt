Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: neighbors are 2, 5, 7
- Node 1: neighbors are 2, 3
- Node 2: neighbors are 0, 1, 6
- Node 3: neighbors are 1, 8
- Node 4: neighbors are 5, 7, 9
- Node 5: neighbors are 0, 4, 7, 9
- Node 6: neighbors are 2, 8
- Node 7: neighbors are 0, 4, 5
- Node 8: neighbors are 3, 6
- Node 9: neighbors are 4, 5

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Nodes 0 and 5 each have 3 neighbors, so they each form 1 3-star.
- There are no other nodes with 3 neighbors, so no additional 3-stars are formed.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 5, 7)>
<5, (0, 4, 7)>
