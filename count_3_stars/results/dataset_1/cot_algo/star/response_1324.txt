Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor nodes for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: neighbors are 1, 3, 4
- Node 1: neighbors are 0, 2, 3, 5, 6
- Node 2: neighbors are 1, 8
- Node 3: neighbors are 0, 1, 6
- Node 4: neighbors are 0, 8
- Node 5: neighbors are 1, 8
- Node 6: neighbors are 1, 3, 9
- Node 8: neighbors are 2, 4, 5
- Node 9: neighbor is 6

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star. The 3-star is <0, (1, 3, 4)>.
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. The 3-stars are: 
   <1, (0, 3, 5)>, <1, (0, 3, 6)>, <1, (0, 5, 6)>, <1, (3, 5, 6)>, <1, (3, 6, 9)>, <1, (5, 6, 8)>, <1, (2, 5, 8)>, <1, (2, 6, 8)>, <1, (4, 5, 8)>, <1, (4, 6, 8)>
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star. The 3-star is <3, (0, 1, 6)>.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star. The 3-star is <6, (1, 3, 9)>.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star. The 3-star is <8, (2, 4, 5)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1] = 14, and the unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (1, 3, 4)>, <1, (0, 3, 5)>, <1, (0, 3, 6)>, <1, (0, 5, 6)>, <1, (3, 5, 6)>, <1, (3, 6, 9)>, <1, (5, 6, 8)>, <1, (2, 5, 8)>, <1, (2, 6, 8)>, <1, (4, 5, 8)>, <1, (4, 6, 8)>, <3, (0, 1, 6)>, <6, (1, 3, 9)>, <8, (2, 4, 5)>.
