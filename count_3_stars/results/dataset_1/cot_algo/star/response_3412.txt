Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 4, 5, 6
- Node 1: 7, 8
- Node 2: 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 3: 4, 6, 8
- Node 4: 0, 3, 5, 6, 9
- Node 5: 0, 2, 4
- Node 6: 0, 2, 3, 4
- Node 7: 1, 2, 8
- Node 8: 1, 2, 3, 7, 9
- Node 9: 2, 4, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with neighbors 5, 8, 9 <2, (5, 8, 9)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with neighbors 3, 5, 6 <4, (3, 5, 6)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with neighbors 1, 2, 9 <8, (1, 2, 9)>

There are 3 unique 3-stars, so the final answer is [3].
