Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Calculating the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

- Node 0 has 2 neighbors: {1, 2}
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: {1, 5, 6}
- Node 4 has 1 neighbor: {1}
- Node 7 has 1 neighbor: {6}
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors: {2, 9}
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors: {6, 8}

No 3-stars can be formed with nodes 0, 4, 7, 8, and 9 as they have less than 3 neighbors.

Now, calculating the 3-stars that can be formed:
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Total 3-stars = 1

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1], and the unique 3-star found is <3, (1, 5, 6)>.
