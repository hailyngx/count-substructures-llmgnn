Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 1, 6, 9
Node 1: 0, 3, 4, 5
Node 2: 4, 5
Node 3: 1, 4, 5
Node 4: 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 9
Node 5: 1, 2, 3, 7, 9
Node 6: 0, 4, 7
Node 7: 4, 5, 6, 9
Node 8: 9
Node 9: 0, 4, 5, 7, 8

Next, we identify nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they are a part of:

Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 48

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 48. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (0, 3, 5)>
<1, (0, 3, 6)>
<1, (0, 4, 5)>
<1, (0, 4, 9)>
<1, (3, 4, 5)>
<4, (1, 2, 3)>
<4, (1, 3, 6)>
<4, (1, 3, 7)>
<4, (1, 5, 7)>
<4, (2, 5, 7)>
<4, (3, 5, 7)>
<4, (3, 6, 7)>
<4, (5, 6, 7)>
<4, (5, 7, 9)>
<4, (6, 7, 9)>
<5, (1, 3, 7)>
<5, (1, 4, 7)>
<5, (2, 3, 7)>
<5, (2, 4, 7)>
<5, (2, 7, 9)>
