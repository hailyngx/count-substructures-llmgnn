Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 1: Neighbor nodes {4}
- Node 4: Neighbor nodes {1, 8, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbor nodes {7, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbor nodes {6, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbor nodes {4, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbor nodes {4, 8}

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 1 + 4 = 5, which gives us [5].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <4, (1, 8, 9)>
- <8, (4, 6, 7)>
- <8, (4, 6, 9)>
- <8, (4, 7, 9)>
- <8, (6, 7, 9)>
