Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 1: {7}
- Node 2: {7}
- Node 3: {4, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {3}
- Node 6: {9}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 8}
- Node 8: {3, 7}
- Node 9: {3, 6}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- For Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 2 ([]).

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <3, (4, 8, 9)>
- <7, (1, 2, 8)>
