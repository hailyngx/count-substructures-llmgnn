Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {5, 8}
- Node 1: {2, 4, 6}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 4}
- Node 3: {2}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 7, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 9}
- Node 6: {1, 9}
- Node 7: {4}
- Node 8: {0}
- Node 9: {4, 5, 6}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1, Node 2, Node 4, and Node 9 have 3 or more neighbors.

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding these up: 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 7

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [7].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (2, 4, 6)>
- <2, (1, 3, 4)>
- <4, (1, 2, 7)>
- <9, (4, 5, 6)>
