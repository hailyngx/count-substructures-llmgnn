Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
- Node 1: 8
- Node 2: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
- Node 3: 2, 4, 7
- Node 4: 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7
- Node 5: 0, 2, 4, 9
- Node 6: 0, 2, 4
- Node 7: 0, 2, 3, 4
- Node 8: 0, 1
- Node 9: 5

Next, we will check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors to form 3-stars:

- Node 0: 3+ neighbors (5)
- Node 2: 5 neighbors (10 3-stars)
- Node 4: 6 neighbors (20 3-stars)

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars with Node 0 
- \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars with Node 2
- \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\) 3-stars with Node 4

The total number of 3-stars is \(10 + 10 + 20 = 40\).

Therefore, the final answer is [40] and the unique 3-stars found are:

- <0, (4, 5, 7)>
- <2, (3, 4, 5)>
- <4, (0, 2, 5)>
- <4, (0, 2, 6)>
- <4, (2, 5, 7)>
