Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 5}
- Node 1: {2}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 5, 6}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 6, 8}
- Node 6: {2, 5, 9}
- Node 7: {8}
- Node 8: {5, 7}
- Node 9: {6}

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed using the \(\binom{n}{3}\) formula:
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form only 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 4 + 4 + 1 = 9, which can be represented as [9].

The 3-stars in this graph are:
- <2, (0, 1, 5)>
- <2, (0, 1, 6)>
- <2, (0, 5, 6)>
- <2, (1, 5, 6)>
- <5, (0, 2, 6)>
- <5, (2, 6, 8)>
- <5, (0, 6, 8)>
- <5, (2, 6, 8)>
- <6, (2, 5, 9)>
