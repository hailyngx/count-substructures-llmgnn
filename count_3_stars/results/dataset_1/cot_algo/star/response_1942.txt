Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {2}
- Node 1: Neighbors {2, 7}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 1}
- Node 3: Neighbors {8}
- Node 4: Neighbors {7}
- Node 5: Neighbors {8}
- Node 6: Neighbors {7, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 4, 6}
- Node 8: Neighbors {3, 5, 6}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
1. Node 7 has 3 neighbors {1, 4, 6}. Formed 3-star <7, (1, 4, 6)>.
2. Node 8 has 3 neighbors {3, 5, 6}. Formed 3-star <8, (3, 5, 6)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [2].
