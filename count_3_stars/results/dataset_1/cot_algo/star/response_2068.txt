Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 4, 9
- Node 1: 0, 2, 4, 6, 9
- Node 2: 0, 1, 3, 4
- Node 3: 0, 2, 5
- Node 4: 0, 1, 2, 9
- Node 5: 3, 7
- Node 6: 1, 9
- Node 7: 5, 8
- Node 8: 7, 9
- Node 9: 0, 1, 4, 6, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 2, and 4: <0, (1, 2, 4)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 4, and 9: <1, (0, 4, 9)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, and 9: <4, (0, 1, 9)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, and 4: <9, (0, 1, 4)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 4, so the final answer is [4].
