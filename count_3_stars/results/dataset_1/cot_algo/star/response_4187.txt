Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 2, 5, 8, 9
- Node 1: 5, 6
- Node 2: 0, 5, 7
- Node 3: 5, 6
- Node 4: 7
- Node 5: 0, 1, 2, 3
- Node 6: 1, 3
- Node 7: 2, 4, 8
- Node 8: 0, 7, 9
- Node 9: 0, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, 2, 5, 7, 8

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with three or more neighbors:
- For Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: [4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1] = 11

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 11, and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 5, 8)>, <2, (0, 5, 7)>, <5, (0, 2, 3)>, <7, (2, 4, 8)>, <8, (0, 7, 9)>
