Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {2}
- Node 1: {2}
- Node 2: {0, 1}
- Node 3: {5, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {9}
- Node 5: {3, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {3}
- Node 8: {3, 5}
- Node 9: {4, 5}

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 0: 0 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 1: 0 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 2: 1 3-star <2, (0, 1)>
- Node 3: 1 3-star <3, (5, 7, 8)>
- Node 4: 0 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 5: 1 3-star <5, (3, 8, 9)>
- Node 7: 0 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 8: 1 3-star <8, (3, 5, 9)>
- Node 9: 0 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3] and the unique 3-stars are:
- <2, (0, 1)>
- <3, (5, 7, 8)>
- <8, (3, 5, 9)>
