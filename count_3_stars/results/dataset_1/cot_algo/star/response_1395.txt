Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph in terms of its adjacency list:
- Node 0 is connected to Node 1
- Node 1 is connected to Node 0
- Node 3 is connected to Node 5, 7
- Node 4 is connected to Node 5, 7
- Node 5 is connected to Node 3, 4, 7
- Node 6 is connected to Node 7, 9
- Node 7 is connected to Node 3, 4, 5, 6
- Node 8 is connected to Node 9
- Node 9 is connected to Node 6, 8

Now, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: [1]
- Node 1: [0]
- Node 3: [5, 7]
- Node 4: [5, 7]
- Node 5: [3, 4, 7]
- Node 6: [7, 9]
- Node 7: [3, 4, 5, 6]
- Node 8: [9]
- Node 9: [6, 8]

Next, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 5 and Node 7 form a 3-star with Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6 and Node 9 form a 3-star with Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 2, and they are:
<5, (3, 4, 7)>, <6, (8, 9)>
