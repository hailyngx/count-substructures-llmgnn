Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 8
- Node 1: 0, 3, 6, 9
- Node 2: 0, 8
- Node 3: 1, 4, 7, 8, 9
- Node 4: 3, 8
- Node 5: 6, 7
- Node 6: 1, 5
- Node 7: 3, 5, 9
- Node 8: 0, 2, 3, 4
- Node 9: 1, 3, 7

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 0: Not a center for a 3-star (has 3 neighbors)
- Node 1: 1 3-star <1, (3, 6, 9)>
- Node 3: 1 3-star <3, (4, 7, 8)>
- Node 5: Not a center for a 3-star (has 2 neighbors)
- Node 6: Not a center for a 3-star (has 2 neighbors)
- Node 7: Not a center for a 3-star (has 3 neighbors)
- Node 8: Not a center for a 3-star (has 4 neighbors)
- Node 9: Not a center for a 3-star (has 3 neighbors)

Total number of 3-stars: [2]
Unique 3-stars: <1, (3, 6, 9)>, <3, (4, 7, 8)>
