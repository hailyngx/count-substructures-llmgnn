Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 5, 7 (degree 4)
- Node 1: 9 (degree 1)
- Node 2: 0, 5, 9 (degree 3)
- Node 3: 0, 4, 9 (degree 3)
- Node 4: 3, 5, 7, 9 (degree 4)
- Node 5: 0, 2, 4 (degree 3)
- Node 6: 7 (degree 1)
- Node 7: 0, 4, 6, 8, 9 (degree 5)
- Node 8: 7 (degree 1)
- Node 9: 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 (degree 5)

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
   
Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 14
   
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [14], and the unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (2, 5, 7)>
<2, (0, 5, 9)>
<3, (0, 4, 9)>
<4, (3, 5, 7)>
<7, (0, 4, 9)>
