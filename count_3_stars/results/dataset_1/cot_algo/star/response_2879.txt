Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 3, 6
- Node 1: 9
- Node 2: 3, 4, 8
- Node 3: 0, 2, 9
- Node 4: 2, 6, 7, 9
- Node 5: 7, 8
- Node 6: 0, 4, 7
- Node 7: 4, 5, 6
- Node 8: 2, 5
- Node 9: 1, 3, 4

Next, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 2: <2, (3, 4, 8)>
- Node 3: <3, (0, 2, 9)>
- Node 4: <4, (2, 6, 7)>, <4, (2, 4, 9)>
- Node 6: <6, (0, 4, 7)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars, we have 4 in total, so the final answer is [4].
