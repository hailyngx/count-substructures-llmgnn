Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbor nodes for each node:

Node 0: 6, 8, 9
Node 1: 4, 9
Node 2: 9
Node 4: 1, 7
Node 5: 9
Node 6: 0
Node 7: 4, 8, 9
Node 8: 0, 7
Node 9: 0, 1, 2, 5, 7

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:

Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 + 1 + 10 = 12.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (6, 8, 9)>
<7, (4, 8, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 2)>
<9, (0, 1, 5)>
<9, (0, 2, 5)>
<9, (1, 2, 5)>
<9, (0, 1, 7)>
<9, (0, 2, 7)>
<9, (1, 2, 7)>
<9, (0, 5, 7)>
<9, (1, 5, 7)>
<9, (2, 5, 7)>

Therefore, the final answer is [12].
