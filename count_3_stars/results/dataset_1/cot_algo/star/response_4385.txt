Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows: 
- Node 0: {3, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 1: {5, 6, 9}
- Node 2: {4, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 3, 6, 7}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 3, 7}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 7: {4, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 7}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 3, 6}

Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 4, and 6, so <0, (3, 4, 6)> can be formed. 
Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 5, and 8, so <2, (4, 5, 8)> can be formed. 
So, the total number of 3-stars is [2].

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found are <0, (3, 4, 6)> and <2, (4, 5, 8)>.
