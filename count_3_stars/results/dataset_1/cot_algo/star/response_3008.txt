Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 6}
- Node 1: {4}
- Node 2: {7, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 6}
- Node 5: {6, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 4, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 7: {2, 6}
- Node 8: {2, 5}
- Node 9: {3, 5, 6}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 6 as the center. 
  Unique 3-stars:
  <6, (0, 4, 5)>
  <6, (0, 5, 7)>
  <6, (0, 5, 9)>
  <6, (4, 5, 7)>
  <6, (4, 5, 9)>
  <6, (5, 7, 9)>
  <6, (0, 4, 7)>
  <6, (0, 4, 9)>
  <6, (4, 7, 9)>
  <6, (0, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [10].
