Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given edges as an adjacency list for better visualization:

0: [8]

1: [6, 8]

2: [6, 8, 9]

3: [6, 7, 8, 9]

5: [6]

6: [1, 2, 3, 5, 8]

7: [3, 8, 9]

8: [0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 7]

9: [2, 3, 7]


Now, let's calculate the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0 has 1 neighbor: [8]
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors: [6, 8]
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: [6, 8, 9] (potential 3-star)
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: [6, 7, 8, 9] (potential 3-star)
- Node 5 has 1 neighbor: [6]
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors: [1, 2, 3, 5, 8] (potential 3-star)
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors: [3, 8, 9] (potential 3-star)
- Node 8 has 6 neighbors: [0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 7] (potential 3-star)
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: [2, 3, 7] (potential 3-star)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 2 and Node 8 can form a 3-star with Node 6: <6, (2, 8)>
- Node 3 and Node 7 can form a 3-star: <3, (7, 8, 9)>, <7, (3, 8, 9)>
- Node 6 can form a 3-star with each of the following pairs: <6, (1, 2, 8)>, <6, (1, 3, 8)>, <6, (2, 3, 8)>
- Node 8 can form a 3-star with each of the following pairs: <8, (0, 1, 2)>, <8, (0, 1, 3)>, <8, (0, 2, 3)>, <8, (1, 2, 3)>, <8, (2, 6, 7)>
- Node 9 does not form any 3-star.

Considering these, we have a total of [7] 3-stars in the given graph.
