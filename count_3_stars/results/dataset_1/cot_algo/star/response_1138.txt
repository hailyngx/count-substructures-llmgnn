Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 4, 5
- Node 1: 2, 4, 5
- Node 2: 1, 3, 8
- Node 3: 2
- Node 4: 0, 1, 9
- Node 5: 0, 1, 9
- Node 7: 8
- Node 8: 2, 7
- Node 9: 4, 5

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: [4]

Unique 3-stars found: <1, (2, 4, 5)>
