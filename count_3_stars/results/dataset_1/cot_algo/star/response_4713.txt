Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbor nodes for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 3, 8
- Node 1: 2, 4
- Node 2: 1, 4, 6, 9
- Node 3: 0, 5, 7
- Node 4: 1, 2, 9
- Node 5: 3, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 6: 2, 5, 7, 9
- Node 7: 3, 5, 6, 8
- Node 8: 0, 5, 7
- Node 9: 2, 4, 5, 6

Now, we will check for each node that has three or more neighbors to see if 3-stars can be formed:
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars: <2, (1, 4, 6)>, <2, (1, 4, 9)>, <2, (4, 6, 9)>, <2, (1, 6, 9)>
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star: <3, (0, 5, 7)>
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star: <4, (1, 2, 9)>
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars: <5, (3, 6, 7)>, <5, (3, 6, 8)>, <5, (3, 6, 9)>, <5, (3, 7, 8)>, <5, (3, 7, 9)>, <5, (3, 8, 9)>, <5, (6, 7, 8)>, <5, (6, 7, 9)>, <5, (6, 8, 9)>, <5, (7, 8, 9)>
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars: <6, (2, 5, 7)>, <6, (2, 5, 9)>, <6, (2, 7, 9)>, <6, (5, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [20] and the unique 3-stars are: 
<2, (1, 4, 6)>, <2, (1, 4, 9)>, <2, (4, 6, 9)>, <2, (1, 6, 9)>, <3, (0, 5, 7)>, <4, (1, 2, 9)>, <5, (3, 6, 7)>, <5, (3, 6, 8)>, <5, (3, 6, 9)>, <5, (3, 7, 8)>, <5, (3, 7, 9)>, <5, (3, 8, 9)>, <5, (6, 7, 8)>, <5, (6, 7, 9)>, <5, (6, 8, 9)>, <5, (7, 8, 9)>, <6, (2, 5, 7)>, <6, (2, 5, 9)>, <6, (2, 7, 9)>, <6, (5, 7, 9)>
