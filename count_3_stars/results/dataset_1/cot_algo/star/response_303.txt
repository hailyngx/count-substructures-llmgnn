Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 2, 4, 6, 9
- Node 1: 2, 4, 8
- Node 2: 0, 1
- Node 3: 4, 9
- Node 4: 0, 1, 3, 7, 9
- Node 5: 7, 8
- Node 6: 0, 7, 8
- Node 7: 4, 5, 6
- Node 8: 1, 5, 6
- Node 9: 0, 3, 4

Next, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 1: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 4: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 7: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 8: inom{3}{3} = 1

Adding them up, we have a total of [4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1] = 17 3-stars.

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (2, 4, 6)>
- <0, (2, 4, 9)>
- <0, (4, 6, 9)>
- <1, (2, 4, 8)>
- <4, (0, 1, 7)>
- <4, (0, 3, 9)>
- <4, (1, 3, 7)>
- <4, (1, 7, 9)>
- <4, (3, 7, 9)>
- <7, (5, 6, 8)>
- <8, (1, 5, 6)>
