Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The 3-star graph in a graph with 3 branches originating from a central node. Let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

1. Node 0: Neighbors {4, 9}. It has 2 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star.

2. Node 1: Neighbors {5, 6}. It has 2 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star.

3. Node 2: Neighbors {4, 5, 6, 7, 9}. It has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars. <2, (4, 5, 6)>, <2, (4, 5, 7)>, <2, (4, 5, 9)>, <2, (4, 6, 7)>, <2, (4, 6, 9)>, <2, (4, 7, 9)>, <2, (5, 6, 7)>, <2, (5, 6, 9)>, <2, (5, 7, 9)>, <2, (6, 7, 9)>.

4. Node 3: Neighbors {4, 5, 7, 8}. It has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars. <3, (4, 5, 7)>, <3, (4, 5, 8)>, <3, (4, 7, 8)>, <3, (5, 7, 8)>.

5. Node 4: Neighbors {0, 2, 3, 6, 8}. It has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars. <4, (0, 2, 3)>, <4, (0, 2, 6)>, <4, (0, 2, 8)>, <4, (0, 3, 6)>, <4, (0, 3, 8)>, <4, (0, 6, 8)>, <4, (2, 3, 6)>, <4, (2, 3, 8)>, <4, (2, 6, 8)>, <4, (3, 6, 8)>.

6. Node 5: Neighbors {1, 2, 3, 6, 7}. It has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars. <5, (1, 2, 3)>, <5, (1, 2, 6)>, <5, (1, 2, 7)>, <5, (1, 3, 6)>, <5, (1, 3, 7)>, <5, (1, 6, 7)>, <5, (2, 3, 6)>, <5, (2, 3, 7)>, <5, (2, 6, 7)>, <5, (3, 6, 7)>.

7. Node 6: Neighbors {1, 2, 4, 5, 7}. It has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars. <6, (1, 2, 4)>, <6, (1, 2, 5)>, <6, (1, 2, 7)>, <6, (1, 4, 5)>, <6, (1, 4, 7)>, <6, (1, 5, 7)>, <6, (2, 4, 5)>, <6, (2, 4, 7)>, <6, (2, 5, 7)>, <6, (4, 5, 7)>.

8. Node 7: Neighbors {2, 3, 5, 6, 9}. It has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars. <7, (2, 3, 5)>, <7, (2, 3, 6)>, <7, (2, 3, 9)>, <7, (2, 5, 6)>, <7, (2, 5, 9)>, <7, (2, 6, 9)>, <7, (3, 5, 6)>, <7, (3, 5, 9)>, <7, (3, 6, 9)>, <7, (5, 6, 9)>.

9. Node 8: Neighbors {3, 4, 9}. It has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star. <8, (3, 4, 9)>.

10. Node 9: Neighbors {0, 2, 7, 8}. It has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars. <9, (0, 2, 7)>, <9, (0, 2, 8)>, <9, (0, 7, 8)>, <9, (2, 7, 8)>.

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [10 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 28]. 
The unique 3-stars found are <2, (4, 5, 6)>, <2, (4, 5, 7)>, <2, (4, 5, 9)>, <2, (4, 6, 7)>, <2, (4, 6, 9)>, <2, (4, 7, 9)>, <2, (5, 6, 7)>, <2, (5, 6, 9)>, <2, (5, 7, 9)>, <2, (6, 7, 9)>, <3, (4, 5, 7)>, <3, (4, 5, 8)>, <3, (4, 7, 8)>, <3, (5, 7, 8)>, <4, (0, 2, 3)>, <4, (0, 2, 6)>, <4, (0, 2, 8)>, <4, (0, 3, 6)>, <4, (0, 3, 8)>, <4, (0, 6, 8)>, <4, (2, 3, 6)>, <4, (2, 3, 8)>, <4, (2, 6, 8)>, <4, (3, 6, 8)>, <5, (1, 2, 3)>, <5, (1, 2, 6)>, <5, (1, 2, 7)>, <5, (1, 3, 6)>, <5, (1, 3, 7)>, <5, (1, 6, 7)>, <5, (2, 3, 6)>, <5, (2, 3, 7)>, <5, (2, 6, 7)>, <5, (3, 6, 7)>, <6, (1, 2, 4)>, <6, (1, 2, 5)>, <6, (1, 2, 7)>, <6, (1, 4, 5)>, <6, (1, 4, 7)>, <6, (1, 5, 7)>, <6, (2, 4, 5)>, <6, (2, 4, 7)>, <6, (2, 5, 7)>, <6, (4, 5, 7)>, <7, (2, 3, 5)>, <7, (2, 3, 6)>, <7, (2, 3, 9)>, <7, (2, 5, 6)>, <7, (2, 5, 9)>, <7, (2, 6, 9)>, <7, (3, 5, 6)>, <7, (3, 5, 9)>, <7, (3, 6, 9)>, <7, (5, 6, 9)>, <8, (3, 4, 9)>, <9, (0, 2, 7)>, <9, (0, 2, 8)>, <9, (0, 7, 8)>, <9, (2, 7, 8)>.
