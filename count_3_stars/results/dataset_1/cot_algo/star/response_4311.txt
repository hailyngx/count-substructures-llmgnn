Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (3, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 0) (8, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 2, 5, 7, 8
- Node 1: 3, 6
- Node 2: 0
- Node 3: 1
- Node 4: 5, 6, 9
- Node 5: 0, 4
- Node 6: 1, 4
- Node 7: 0
- Node 8: 0
- Node 9: 4

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Summing these up, we have a total of [5] 3-stars. 

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (2, 5, 7)>
- <0, (2, 5, 8)>
- <0, (5, 7, 8)>
- <0, (2, 7, 8)>
- <4, (5, 6, 9)>
