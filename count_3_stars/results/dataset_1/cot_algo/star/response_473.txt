Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 1, 2, 8
- Node 1: 0, 4, 5
- Node 2: 0, 7, 9
- Node 3: 8, 9
- Node 4: 1, 5, 6
- Node 5: 1, 4, 8
- Node 6: 4
- Node 7: 2, 8
- Node 8: 0, 3, 5, 7
- Node 9: 2, 3

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 0, Node 1, Node 2, and Node 8 have 3 or more neighbors, so they can potentially form 3-stars.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
\[ \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} = 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 10 \]
So, there are 10 unique 3-stars in this graph.

Listing the unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 2, 8)>, <1, (0, 4, 5)>, <2, (0, 7, 9)>, <8, (0, 3, 5)>, <8, (0, 5, 7)>, <8, (3, 5, 7)>, <8, (0, 2, 7)>, <8, (2, 7, 9)>, <4, (1, 5, 6)>, <5, (1, 4, 8)>
