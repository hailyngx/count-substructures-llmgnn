Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors are 3 and 5
- Node 1: Neighbors are 2, 6, and 7
- Node 2: Neighbor is 1
- Node 3: Neighbors are 0, 5, and 8
- Node 4: Neighbors are 5 and 9
- Node 5: Neighbors are 0, 3, 4, and 9
- Node 6: Neighbors are 1 and 8
- Node 7: Neighbors are 1 and 8
- Node 8: Neighbors are 3, 6, and 7
- Node 9: Neighbors are 4 and 5

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star.
- Node 1: has 3 neighbors, so 1 3-star.
- Node 3: has 3 neighbors, so 1 3-star.
- Node 5: has 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8: has 3 neighbors, so 1 3-star.

Adding up these 3-stars, we have a total of 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 7 3-stars. Thus, the final answer is [7], and the unique 3-stars are <1, (2, 6, 7)>, <3, (0, 5, 8)>, <5, (0, 4, 9)>, and <8, (6, 7, 1)>.
