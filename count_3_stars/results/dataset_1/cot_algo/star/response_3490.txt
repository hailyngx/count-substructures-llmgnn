Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given edges in terms of the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {3, 5, 6}
- Node 2: {6}
- Node 3: {0, 8}
- Node 4: {5, 6}
- Node 5: {0, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 4, 8}
- Node 7: {5}
- Node 8: {3, 6}
- Node 9: {5}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 1 + 4 + 4 = 9 \), so we have [9] 3-stars in total.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (3, 5, 6)>
- <5, (0, 4, 7)>
- <5, (0, 4, 9)>
- <5, (4, 7, 9)>
- <6, (0, 4, 8)>
- <6, (2, 4, 8)>
- <6, (0, 4, 8)>
- <6, (4, 7, 8)>
- <6, (4, 8, 9)>
