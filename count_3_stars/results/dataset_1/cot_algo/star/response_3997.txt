Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {3, 4, 5}
- Node 1: {2, 8}
- Node 2: {1, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 3: {0, 5}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 5}
- Node 5: {0, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {2, 7}
- Node 7: {2, 5, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {1, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {5, 7, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 0, Node 5, and Node 7 have 3 or more neighbors, so we need to calculate the number of 3-stars they can form.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (Only one 3-star with nodes 3, 4, 5)
- Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) (There are 20 ways to choose 3 nodes out of its 6 neighbors)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) (There are 10 ways to choose 3 nodes out of its 5 neighbors)

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 20 + 10 = 31

Therefore, the final answer is [31] and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<5, (0, 8, 9)>
<7, (2, 5, 9)>
<7, (5, 6, 9)>
<7, (5, 8, 9)>
<7, (6, 8, 9)>
