Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 4, 5, 7 (degree 5)
- Node 1: 0, 6 (degree 2)
- Node 2: 3, 6, 9 (degree 3)
- Node 3: 0, 2, 4 (degree 3)
- Node 4: 0, 3, 5, 9 (degree 4)
- Node 5: 0, 4, 6, 9 (degree 4)
- Node 6: 1, 2, 5 (degree 3)
- Node 7: 0 (degree 1)
- Node 9: 2, 4, 5 (degree 3)

Next, we will look at nodes with degree 3 or more to identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 has degree 5: [5 choose 3] = 10 3-stars
- Node 2 has degree 3: [3 choose 3] = 1 3-star
- Node 3 has degree 3: [3 choose 3] = 1 3-star
- Node 4 has degree 4: [4 choose 3] = 4 3-stars
- Node 5 has degree 4: [4 choose 3] = 4 3-stars
- Node 9 has degree 3: [3 choose 3] = 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 21

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [21], and the unique 3-stars found are: <0, (1, 4, 5)>, <0, (3, 4, 5)>, <0, (4, 5, 9)>, <0, (3, 4, 9)>, <2, (3, 6, 9)>, <3, (0, 2, 4)>, <4, (0, 3, 5)>, <5, (0, 4, 6)>, <9, (2, 4, 5)>.
