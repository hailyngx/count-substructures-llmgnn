Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The neighbor nodes for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: {3}
- Node 1: {4, 7, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 5, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {1, 5, 6}
- Node 5: {3, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 6: {3, 4, 5}
- Node 7: {1, 3, 9}
- Node 8: {1, 3, 5}
- Node 9: {7}

Next, we check which nodes have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars: \( 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 19 \)

Therefore, the final answer is [19], and the unique 3-stars found are <1, (4, 7, 8)>, <3, (0, 5, 6)>, <4, (1, 5, 6)>, and <5, (3, 4, 8)>.
