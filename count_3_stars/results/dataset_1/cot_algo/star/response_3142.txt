Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, we list the neighbor nodes of each node:
- Node 0: {1, 6, 7}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 3}
- Node 2: {1, 4, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 6, 9}
- Node 4: {2, 6}
- Node 5: {6}
- Node 6: {0, 3, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 7: {0, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {2, 3, 7}

Next, we identify the nodes with at least 3 neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 1, Node 2, Node 3, Node 6, Node 7, and Node 9 have at least 3 neighbors.

Calculating the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \( [1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1] = [16] \)

Listing the unique 3-stars:
- <0, (1, 6, 7)>
- <1, (0, 2, 3)>
- <2, (1, 4, 9)>
- <3, (1, 6, 9)>
- <6, (0, 3, 4)>
- <6, (0, 4, 5)>
- <6, (0, 5, 7)>
- <6, (3, 4, 7)>
- <6, (3, 5, 7)>
- <6, (4, 5, 7)>
