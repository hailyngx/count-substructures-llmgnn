Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 26 edges, we first need to find the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 2, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 4}
- Node 2: {0, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 3}
- Node 5: {7, 9}
- Node 6: {3, 7}
- Node 7: {5, 6}
- Node 8: {0}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 3, 5}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. 
  <0, (1, 2, 8)>, <0, (1, 2, 9)>, <0, (1, 8, 9)>, <0, (2, 8, 9)>
  
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. 
  <3, (1, 4, 6)>, <3, (1, 4, 9)>, <3, (1, 6, 9)>, <3, (4, 6, 9)>
  
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3, so it cannot form any 3-star.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get [8].

Hence, the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 2, 8)>, <0, (1, 2, 9)>, <0, (1, 8, 9)>, <0, (2, 8, 9)>, <3, (1, 4, 6)>, <3, (1, 4, 9)>, <3, (1, 6, 9)>, <3, (4, 6, 9)>
