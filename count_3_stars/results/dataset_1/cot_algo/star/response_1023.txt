Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 2, 4}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {1}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 4}
- Node 6: {2, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {2}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 4, 6}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 4, 6}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

- Node 0 does not form a 3-star as it has only 3 neighbors.
- Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (0, 8, 9)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star: <2, (4, 8, 9)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star: <4, (2, 8, 9)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star: <8, (2, 4, 6)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star: <9, (2, 4, 6)>

Counting the unique 3-stars gives us a total of 5 3-stars. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [5].
