Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: 2
Node 1: 3, 6, 7, 8
Node 2: 0, 6
Node 3: 1, 6, 9
Node 4: 8
Node 5: 6
Node 6: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 9
Node 7: 1
Node 8: 1, 4, 6
Node 9: 3, 6

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors (6, 7, 8) => <1, (6, 7, 8)>
Node 3 forms a 3-star with neighbors (6, 9, 1) => <3, (6, 9, 1)>
Node 6 forms a 3-star with neighbors (1, 2, 3) => <6, (1, 2, 3)>
Node 6 forms a 3-star with neighbors (1, 8, 9) => <6, (1, 8, 9)>
Node 6 forms a 3-star with neighbors (2, 3, 5) => <6, (2, 3, 5)>
Node 6 forms a 3-star with neighbors (8, 1, 2) => <6, (8, 1, 2)>
Node 6 forms a 3-star with neighbors (9, 1, 3) => <6, (9, 1, 3)>
Node 6 forms a 3-star with neighbors (8, 4, 9) => <6, (8, 4, 9)>
Node 6 forms a 3-star with neighbors (1, 3, 9) => <6, (1, 3, 9)>
Node 8 forms a 3-star with neighbors (1, 4, 6) => <8, (1, 4, 6)>
Node 9 forms a 3-star with neighbors (3, 6, 1) => <9, (3, 6, 1)>

Total number of 3-stars: [11]
