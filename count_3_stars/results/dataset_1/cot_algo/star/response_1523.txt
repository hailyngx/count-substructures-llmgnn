Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

```
      1 -- 7       2
      |    |       |
      9    8 -- 5 -- 6 -- 4
                  |    |
                  0    9
                  
```

For each node, let's find its neighbor nodes:
- Node 0: {6, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {7, 9}
- Node 2: {5, 6}
- Node 4: {6}
- Node 5: {2, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 4, 5}
- Node 7: {1, 8}
- Node 8: {0, 5, 7}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 5}

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 three-star.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) three-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) three-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 1 + 4 + 4 = 9, which can be represented as [9].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <0, 6, 8, 9>
- <5, 2, 6, 8>
- <5, 2, 6, 9>
- <5, 6, 8, 9>
- <6, 0, 2, 4>
- <6, 0, 2, 5>
- <6, 0, 4, 5>
- <6, 2, 4, 5>
- <6, 2, 5, 8>
