Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {7}
- Node 1: {4, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {5, 8}
- Node 3: {6, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 2}
- Node 6: {3, 8}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 9}
- Node 8: {2, 6}
- Node 9: {1, 3, 4, 7}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors {4, 5, 7}  => <1, (4, 5, 7)>  
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with neighbors {1, 3, 4} => <9, (1, 3, 4)> 
- Node 9 forms another 3-star with neighbors {1, 4, 7} => <9, (1, 4, 7)> 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [3].
