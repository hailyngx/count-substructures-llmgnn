Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 7, 8
- Node 1: 2, 8
- Node 2: 1
- Node 3: 5
- Node 4: 7, 9
- Node 5: 3, 7, 8
- Node 7: 0, 4, 5
- Node 8: 0, 1, 5
- Node 9: 4

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

For Node 0, inom{2}{3} = 0 3-stars
For Node 1, inom{2}{3} = 0 3-stars
For Node 2, inom{1}{3} = 0 3-stars
For Node 3, inom{1}{3} = 0 3-stars
For Node 4, inom{2}{3} = 0 3-stars
For Node 5, inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star <5, (3, 7, 8)>
For Node 7, inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star <7, (0, 4, 5)>
For Node 8, inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star <8, (0, 1, 5)>
For Node 9, inom{1}{3} = 0 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [3] and the unique 3-stars found are <5, (3, 7, 8)>, <7, (0, 4, 5)>, <8, (0, 1, 5)>.
