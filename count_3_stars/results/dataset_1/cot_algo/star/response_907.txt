Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first find the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: (1, 2, 5, 8)
- Node 1: (0, 2, 3, 7, 8)
- Node 2: (0, 1, 4, 7, 8, 9)
- Node 3: (1)
- Node 4: (2, 5, 6, 7, 9)
- Node 5: (0, 4, 6)
- Node 6: (4, 5, 8)
- Node 7: (1, 2, 4)
- Node 8: (0, 1, 2, 6)
- Node 9: (2, 4)

Now, we need to find the 3-stars in this graph. We can see that nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, and 8 have 4 or more neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars for these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 0 as the center.
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 1 as the center.
- Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars with node 2 as the center.
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 4 as the center.
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 8 as the center.

Total number of 3-stars: \( [4 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 4] = [48] \)

Unique 3-stars:
- <0, (1, 2, 8)>
- <1, (0, 2, 8)>
- <2, (0, 1, 8)>
- <2, (4, 6, 9)>
- <4, (2, 5, 7)>
- <8, (0, 1, 6)>
