Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's organize the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 5, 8
- Node 1: 2, 8
- Node 2: 1, 4, 8
- Node 3: 6, 8
- Node 4: 2, 6
- Node 5: 0, 7
- Node 6: 3, 4, 7, 8, 9
- Node 7: 5, 6
- Node 8: 0, 1, 2, 3, 6
- Node 9: 6

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
Node 0: Does not form any 3-star. (2 neighbors)
Node 1: Does not form any 3-star. (2 neighbors)
Node 2: Does not form any 3-star. (3 neighbors)
Node 3: Does not form any 3-star. (2 neighbors)
Node 4: Does not form any 3-star. (2 neighbors)
Node 5: Does not form any 3-star. (2 neighbors)
Node 6: Forms 1 3-star. (5 neighbors) <6, (3, 4, 7)>
Node 7: Does not form any 3-star. (2 neighbors)
Node 8: Does not form any 3-star. (5 neighbors) 

The total number of 3-stars formed is [6].

Unique 3-stars:
- <6, (3, 4, 7)>
