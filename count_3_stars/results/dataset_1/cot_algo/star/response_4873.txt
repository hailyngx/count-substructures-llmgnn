Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 4, 7, 9
- Node 1: 0, 4, 5, 7, 9
- Node 2: 0, 5
- Node 3: 6, 7, 9
- Node 4: 0, 1, 5, 6, 8, 9
- Node 5: 1, 2, 4
- Node 6: 3, 4, 8
- Node 7: 0, 1, 3, 8
- Node 8: 4, 6, 7, 9
- Node 9: 0, 1, 3, 4, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 1, Node 4, Node 8, and Node 9.

Next, we calculate \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

The total number of 3-stars is 10 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 10 = 54.

Therefore, the final answer is [54] and the unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (1, 4, 9)>
- <1, (0, 4, 9)>
- <4, (0, 1, 9)>
- <8, (4, 6, 9)>
