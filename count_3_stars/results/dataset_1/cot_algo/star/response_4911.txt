Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (4, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {4, 8}
- Node 1: {3, 7}
- Node 2: {6, 7}
- Node 3: {1}
- Node 4: {0}
- Node 6: {2, 7, 9}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 6}
- Node 8: {0}
- Node 9: {6}

Next, we'll identify the 3-stars:
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <6, (2, 7, 9)>
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <7, (1, 2, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
