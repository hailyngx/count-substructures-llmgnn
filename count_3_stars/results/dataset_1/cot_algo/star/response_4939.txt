Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to determine the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0: {1, 3, 5, 7}
Node 1: {0}
Node 2: {3, 9}
Node 3: {0, 2, 4, 6, 8}
Node 4: {3, 6, 8}
Node 5: {0}
Node 6: {3, 4, 8}
Node 7: {0, 9}
Node 8: {3, 4, 6, 9}
Node 9: {2, 7, 8}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1] = [20] \).

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<3, (2, 4, 6)>
<4, (3, 6, 8)>
<8, (3, 4, 6)>
<9, (2, 7, 8)>
