Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {2}
- Node 1: {2, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 6, 7}
- Node 3: {5, 6, 9}
- Node 4: {9}
- Node 5: {3, 8}
- Node 6: {2, 3, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {2}
- Node 8: {5, 6}
- Node 9: {1, 3, 4, 6}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Nodes with 3 neighbors or more: 2, 6, 9
- Number of 3-stars for node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Number of 3-stars for node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Number of 3-stars for node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 = 12

So, the final answer is [12], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (0, 1, 7)>
<2, (0, 1, 6)>
<2, (0, 6, 7)>
<2, (1, 6, 7)>
<6, (2, 3, 8)>
<6, (2, 3, 9)>
<6, (2, 8, 9)>
<6, (3, 8, 9)>
<9, (1, 4, 6)>
<9, (1, 3, 6)>
<9, (1, 3, 9)>
<9, (4, 6, 9)>
