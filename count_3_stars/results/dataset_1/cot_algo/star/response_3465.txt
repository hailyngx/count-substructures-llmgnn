Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 4, 9
- Node 1: 2
- Node 2: 1, 4, 9
- Node 3: 4, 6, 9
- Node 4: 0, 2, 3
- Node 5: 7
- Node 6: 3, 7, 8
- Node 7: 5, 6, 9
- Node 8: 6, 9
- Node 9: 0, 2, 3, 7, 8

Next, we will identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:
- Node 0: Does not form a 3-star (2 neighbors)
- Node 1: Does not form a 3-star (1 neighbor)
- Node 2: Forms a 3-star with neighbors 1, 4, 9 <2, (1, 4, 9)>
- Node 3: Forms a 3-star with neighbors 4, 6, 9 <3, (4, 6, 9)>
- Node 4: Forms a 3-star with neighbors 0, 2, 3 <4, (0, 2, 3)>
- Node 5: Does not form a 3-star (1 neighbor)
- Node 6: Does not form a 3-star (3 neighbors)
- Node 7: Does not form a 3-star (3 neighbors)
- Node 8: Does not form a 3-star (2 neighbors)
- Node 9: Forms a 3-star with neighbors 2, 3, 7 <9, (2, 3, 7)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 3, so the final answer is [3].
