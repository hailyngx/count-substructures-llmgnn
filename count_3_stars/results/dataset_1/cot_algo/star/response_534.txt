Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 6}
- Node 4: {0, 1}
- Node 5: {6, 7}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 2, 5, 8}
- Node 7: {0, 5}
- Node 8: {6, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 8}

Nodes 0, 1, and 6 have three or more neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars they form:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 10 = 30

Therefore, the final answer is [30], and the unique 3-stars are <0, (1, 2, 7)>, <1, (0, 2, 9)>, and <6, (0, 8, 5)>.
