Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (8, 1) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 16 edges, we can start by identifying the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 3, 4}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 6, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbor {5}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 4, 6}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 3}
- Node 5: Neighbor {2}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 3}
- Node 7: No neighbors
- Node 8: Neighbor {1}
- Node 9: No neighbors

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 3, which are:

<0, (1, 3, 4)>, <1, (0, 6, 8)>, <3, (0, 4, 6)>.

Therefore, the final answer is [3].
