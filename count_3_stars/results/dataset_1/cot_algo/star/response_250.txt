Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: Neighbors = {1, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors = {0, 5, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors = {8, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors = {5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors = {0, 1, 4, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors = {5, 7, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors = {0, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 8: Neighbors = {3, 4}
- Node 9: Neighbors = {0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6}

Next, we will find the number of 3-stars in the graph:

Nodes that form a 3-star:
- Node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 1: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 5: inom{6}{3} = 20
- Node 6: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 7: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 9: inom{6}{3} = 20

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 20 + 1 + 4 + 20 = 54

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [54], and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<0, (1, 5, 9)>
<0, (1, 7, 9)>
<0, (5, 7, 9)>
<4, (5, 6, 7)>
<4, (5, 7, 9)>
<4, (6, 7, 9)>
<5, (0, 6, 9)>
<5, (1, 4, 6)>
<5, (1, 6, 9)>
<5, (4, 6, 7)>
<5, (4, 6, 9)>
<5, (4, 7, 9)>
<5, (6, 7, 9)>
<7, (4, 6, 9)>
<9, (0, 4, 6)>
<9, (0, 4, 9)>
<9, (0, 6, 9)>
<9, (1, 4, 6)>
<9, (1, 4, 9)>
<9, (1, 6, 9)>
<9, (4, 6, 7)>
<9, (4, 6, 9)>
<9, (4, 7, 9)>
<9, (6, 7, 9)>
