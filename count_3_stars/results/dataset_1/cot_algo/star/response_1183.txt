Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {3, 6}
- Node 1: {3, 9}
- Node 2: {6, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 5}
- Node 5: {3, 6, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 5, 8}
- Node 7: {8}
- Node 8: {2, 6, 7}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 5}

Now, let's calculate how many 3-stars each node is involved in:

- Node 0: 1 3-star
- Node 1: 1 3-star
- Node 2: 1 3-star
- Node 3: 1 3-star
- Node 5: 1 3-star
- Node 6: 1 3-star
- Node 9: 1 3-star

Now, let's sum up the total number of 3-stars: [7].

The unique 3-stars are:

<0, (3, 6)>
<1, (3, 9)>
<2, (6, 8, 9)>
<3, (0, 1, 5)>
<5, (3, 6, 9)>
<6, (0, 2, 5, 8)>
<9, (1, 2, 5)>
