Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:

Node 0 neighbors: 3, 4, 5, 7
Node 1 neighbors: 6, 8
Node 2 neighbors: 4, 5
Node 3 neighbors: 0
Node 4 neighbors: 0, 2, 5, 6
Node 5 neighbors: 0, 2, 4
Node 6 neighbors: 1, 4, 8
Node 7 neighbors: 0
Node 8 neighbors: 1, 6

Next, we'll identify the 3-stars:

Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
<Node 0, (3, 4, 5)>
<Node 0, (3, 4, 7)>
<Node 0, (3, 5, 7)>
<Node 0, (4, 5, 7)>

Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
<Node 4, (0, 2, 5)>
<Node 4, (2, 5, 6)>
<Node 4, (0, 5, 6)>
<Node 4, (0, 2, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8], and the unique 3-stars found are <0, (3, 4, 5)>, <0, (3, 4, 7)>, <0, (3, 5, 7)>, <0, (4, 5, 7)>, <4, (0, 2, 5)>, <4, (2, 5, 6)>, <4, (0, 5, 6)>, <4, (0, 2, 6)>.
