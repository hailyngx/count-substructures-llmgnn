Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 32 edges, let's first find the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: 1, 7, 8
- Node 1: 0, 2, 6, 8
- Node 2: 1, 4, 5, 6
- Node 3: 4, 8, 9
- Node 4: 2, 3, 5
- Node 5: 2, 4
- Node 6: 1, 2, 9
- Node 7: 0, 8, 9
- Node 8: 0, 1, 3, 7
- Node 9: 3, 6, 7

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 9 have three or more neighbors.

For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars they are a part of using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is: \( [1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1] = [17] \)

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:

- <0, 1, 8>
- <1, 2, 6>
- <1, 2, 8>
- <1, 6, 8>
- <3, 4, 8>
- <4, 5, 2>
- <8, 0, 1>
- <9, 6, 7>
