Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 8, 9
- Node 1: 3, 7
- Node 2: 9
- Node 3: 1, 5
- Node 4: 7
- Node 5: 3, 9
- Node 6: 8
- Node 7: 1, 4
- Node 8: 0, 6
- Node 9: 0, 2, 5

Now, we'll identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors, and calculate the number of 3-stars for each:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star.
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star.
- Node 2 has 1 neighbor, so it does not form any 3-star.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star.
- Node 4 has 1 neighbor, so it does not form any 3-star.
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star.
- Node 6 has 1 neighbor, so it does not form any 3-star.
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star.
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [1], and the unique 3-star found is <9, (0, 2, 5)>.
