Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to determine the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 4, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 8}
- Node 2: {1, 5}
- Node 3: {5, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 7, 8}
- Node 5: {2, 3, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {8, 9}
- Node 7: {4, 5}
- Node 8: {1, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 9: {0, 3, 5, 6}

Now, we identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 20.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [20], and the unique 3-stars found in this graph are:

- <0, (1, 4, 9)>
- <1, (0, 2, 8)>
- <5, (2, 3, 7)>
- <5, (2, 3, 8)>
- <5, (2, 7, 8)>
- <5, (3, 7, 8)>
- <5, (2, 7, 9)>
- <5, (3, 7, 9)>
- <5, (2, 8, 9)>
- <5, (3, 8, 9)>
- <8, (1, 4, 6)>
- <8, (1, 4, 5)>
- <8, (1, 5, 6)>
- <8, (4, 5, 6)>
- <9, (0, 3, 5)>
- <9, (0, 3, 6)>
- <9, (3, 5, 6)>
- <9, (0, 5, 6)>
