Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 1, 8, 9
Node 1: 0, 6, 8
Node 2: 6, 7, 9
Node 3: 4, 8
Node 4: 3, 6, 7
Node 5: 6, 8
Node 6: 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9
Node 7: 2, 4, 6
Node 8: 0, 1, 3, 5
Node 9: 0, 2, 6

Now, we can see that Node 6 has 6 neighbors, so we can calculate the number of 3-stars it is a part of using the formula \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \).
Similarly, Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it is part of \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 20 + 4 = 24 \).

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<6, (1, 2, 4)>
<6, (1, 2, 5)>
<6, (1, 4, 5)>
<6, (2, 4, 5)>
<8, (0, 1, 3)>
