Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 6
- Node 1: 0, 7, 8, 9
- Node 2: 4, 9
- Node 3: 8
- Node 4: 2, 5, 7, 9
- Node 5: 4, 9
- Node 6: 0, 7
- Node 7: 1, 4, 6, 9
- Node 8: 1, 3, 9
- Node 9: 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8

Now, we can identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. These are: <1, (7, 8, 9)>, <1, (4, 8, 9)>, <1, (4, 7, 9)>, <1, (4, 7, 8)>.
- Node 4 also has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars: <4, (5, 7, 9)>, <4, (2, 7, 9)>, <4, (2, 5, 9)>, <4, (2, 5, 7)>.
- Node 7 and Node 9 have 4 neighbors each, so they can also form 4 3-stars each. However, we need to make sure we don't count duplicates: <7, (1, 4, 9)>, <7, (1, 6, 9)>, <7, (1, 6, 4)>, <7, (6, 4, 9)>; and <9, (1, 4, 8)>, <9, (1, 5, 8)>, <9, (1, 2, 8)>, <9, (2, 5, 8)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1] = [6], and the unique 3-stars found are <1, (7, 8, 9)>, <4, (5, 7, 9)>, <4, (2, 7, 9)>, <7, (1, 4, 9)>, <9, (1, 4, 8)>, and <9, (1, 5, 8)>.
