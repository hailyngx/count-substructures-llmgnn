Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's create the neighbor sets for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {5, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 1: {4, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 2: {3, 9}
- Node 3: {2, 5, 7}
- Node 4: {1, 6}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 3, 6, 7}
- Node 6: {0, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 3, 5, 6}
- Node 8: {1}
- Node 9: {0, 2}

Now, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with at least 3 neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Finally, sum up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 32

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [32].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (5, 6, 7)>
- <1, (4, 5, 7)>
- <5, (0, 3, 6)>
- <6, (0, 4, 5)>
- <7, (1, 3, 5)>
