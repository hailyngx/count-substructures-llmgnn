Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {4}
- Node 1: {4, 8}
- Node 2: {4, 6}
- Node 3: {7, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 2, 5, 7}
- Node 5: {4, 7, 8}
- Node 6: {2, 7, 9}
- Node 7: {3, 4, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 8: {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {6, 8}

Now, we will check each node that has three or more neighbors to see if they form any 3-stars:
- Node 1, Node 4, Node 5, Node 7, and Node 8 have 5 neighbors each, so they can potentially form 3-stars.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:
- For Node 1, we have \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- For Node 4, we have \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- For Node 5, we have \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- For Node 7, we have \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- For Node 8, we have \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Now, let's sum up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 10 = 41

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 41, and they are:
<1, (4, 5, 8)>, <4, (1, 5, 7)>, <4, (1, 7, 8)>, <4, (5, 7, 8)>, <5, (4, 7, 8)>, <7, (4, 5, 8)>
