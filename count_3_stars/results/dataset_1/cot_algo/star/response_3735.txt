Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 1, 3, 5, 8
Node 1: 0, 2, 5
Node 2: 1, 3, 6
Node 3: 0, 2, 6, 9
Node 4: 7, 9
Node 5: 0, 1, 6, 7
Node 6: 2, 3, 5, 8, 9
Node 7: 4, 5
Node 8: 0, 6
Node 9: 3, 4, 6

Now we need to identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

Node 0 can form a 3-star with neighbors 1, 3, and 5.
Node 3 can form a 3-star with neighbors 2, 6, and 9.
Node 5 can form a 3-star with neighbors 1, 6, and 7.
Node 6 can form a 3-star with neighbors 3, 5, and 9.

So, there are 4 unique 3-stars in this graph, resulting in a total of [4] 3-stars:
<0, (1, 3, 5)>, <3, (2, 6, 9)>, <5, (1, 6, 7)>, <6, (3, 5, 9)>
