Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph can be illustrated as follows:

```
    1 -- 0 -- 4           6 -- 3
    |         |           |
    8         9           7 -- 5
    |
    2
```

We can now determine the 3-stars in this graph by looking at each node's neighbors:

- Node 0 has neighbors: 1, 4, 8, 9
- Node 1 has neighbors: 0, 4
- Node 2 has neighbors: 5, 9
- Node 3 has neighbors: 6, 8
- Node 4 has neighbors: 0, 1, 9
- Node 5 has neighbors: 2, 6, 8
- Node 6 has neighbors: 3, 5, 7
- Node 7 has neighbors: 6, 9
- Node 8 has neighbors: 0, 3, 5
- Node 9 has neighbors: 0, 2, 4, 7

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we get a total of 12 3-stars in this graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [12] and the unique 3-stars found are <0, (1, 4, 8)>, <0, (1, 4, 9)>, <0, (4, 8, 9)>, <0, (1, 8, 9)>, <4, (1, 0, 9)>, <5, (2, 6, 8)>, <6, (3, 5, 7)>, <8, (0, 3, 5)>, <9, (0, 4, 7)>, <9, (0, 2, 7)>, <9, (2, 4, 7)>, <9, (0, 4, 2)>.
