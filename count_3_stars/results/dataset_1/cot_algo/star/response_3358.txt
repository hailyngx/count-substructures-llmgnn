Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, we can start by identifying the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 4, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 2: {0, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 3: {4, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 2, 4}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 8}
- Node 7: {3}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 3, 4, 6}
- Node 9: {0, 2}

Based on the combinatorial calculation \( \binom{n}{3} \), we can find the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [35 + 10 + 20] = [65] \).

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

- <0, (1, 4, 8)>
- <0, (2, 4, 5)>
- <1, (0, 4, 5)>
- <4, (0, 1, 8)>
