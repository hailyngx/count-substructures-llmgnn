Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 5, 6, 8
- Node 1: 0, 5
- Node 2: 3, 4, 8
- Node 3: 2
- Node 4: 2, 5
- Node 5: 0, 1, 4
- Node 6: 0, 9
- Node 7: 9
- Node 8: 0, 2
- Node 9: 6, 7

Next, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 8: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: [4 + 1 + 1 = 6]

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<2, (3, 4, 8)>
<5, (0, 1, 4)>
