Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are:
- Node 0: {6, 8}
- Node 1: {4, 6}
- Node 2: {5, 7}
- Node 3: {5, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 5, 8}
- Node 5: {2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 3, 5, 8}
- Node 7: {2, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 4, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {3, 5, 7, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with neighbors {5, 6, 7}.
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with neighbors {4, 8, 9}.
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with neighbors {4, 5, 9}.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [3].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <3, (5, 6, 7)>
- <5, (4, 8, 9)>
- <8, (4, 5, 9)>
