Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph information, the neighbor sets for each node are as follows:

Node 0: {1, 4, 5, 8}
Node 1: {0, 9}
Node 2: {5, 9}
Node 3: {5}
Node 4: {0, 5, 9}
Node 5: {0, 2, 3, 4, 6}
Node 6: {5}
Node 8: {0, 9}
Node 9: {1, 2, 4, 8}

Now, we will check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors to form 3-stars:

Nodes 0, 4, 5, and 9 have 3 or more neighbors, so we can form 3-stars involving these nodes.

For Node 0:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \] 3-stars
<0, (1, 4, 5)>, <0, (1, 4, 8)>, <0, (4, 5, 8)>, <0, (1, 5, 8)>

For Node 4:
\[ \binom{3}{3} = 1 \] 3-star
<4, (0, 5, 9)>

For Node 5:
\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \] 3-stars
<5, (0, 2, 3)>, <5, (0, 2, 4)>, <5, (0, 2, 6)>, <5, (0, 3, 6)>, <5, (0, 4, 6)>, 
<5, (2, 3, 4)>, <5, (2, 3, 6)>, <5, (2, 4, 6)>, <5, (3, 4, 6)>, <5, (0, 4, 6)>

For Node 9:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \] 3-stars
<9, (1, 2, 4)>, <9, (1, 2, 8)>, <9, (1, 4, 8)>, <9, (2, 4, 8)>

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 19
So, the final answer is [19]. The unique 3-stars found are <0, (1, 4, 5)>, <0, (1, 4, 8)>, <0, (4, 5, 8)>, <0, (1, 5, 8)>, <4, (0, 5, 9)>, <5, (0, 2, 3)>, <5, (0, 2, 4)>, <5, (0, 2, 6)>, <5, (0, 3, 6)>, <5, (0, 4, 6)>, <5, (2, 3, 4)>, <5, (2, 3, 6)>, <5, (2, 4, 6)>, <5, (3, 4, 6)>, <9, (1, 2, 4)>, <9, (1, 2, 8)>, <9, (1, 4, 8)>, <9, (2, 4, 8)>.
