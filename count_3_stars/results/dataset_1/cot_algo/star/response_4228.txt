Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: 1
Node 1: 0, 3, 5
Node 2: 5
Node 3: 1, 5, 6, 9
Node 4: 9
Node 5: 1, 2, 3, 8
Node 6: 3, 9
Node 7: 8, 9
Node 8: 5, 7
Node 9: 3, 4, 6, 7

Next, we identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors: nodes 1, 3, 5, 8, and 9.

For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (since it has fewer than 3 neighbors)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 13

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [13]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (0, 3, 5)>
<3, (1, 5, 6)>
<3, (1, 5, 9)>
<3, (5, 6, 9)>
<5, (1, 3, 8)>
<5, (2, 3, 8)>
<5, (3, 6, 8)>
<5, (3, 9, 8)>
<9, (3, 4, 6)>
<9, (3, 6, 7)>
<9, (3, 7, 4)>
<9, (4, 6, 7)>
<9, (6, 7, 4)>
