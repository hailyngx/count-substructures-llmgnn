Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighborhood set for each node:

- Node 0: {6, 8}
- Node 1: {2, 4, 6}
- Node 2: {1, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {8}
- Node 4: {1, 5}
- Node 5: {4}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {8, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 3, 6, 7}
- Node 9: {2, 6, 7}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 1, Node 2, Node 6, Node 8, and Node 9 have three or more neighbors.

Next, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars formed by these nodes:

- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding these up: 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 17

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [17], and the unique 3-stars found are: 
<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<2, (1, 8, 9)>
<6, (0, 1, 8)>
<8, (0, 2, 3)>
<9, (2, 6, 7)>
