Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {5}
- Node 1: {9}
- Node 2: {3, 4, 5}
- Node 3: {2, 5, 8}
- Node 4: {2, 5}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 3, 4, 7}
- Node 6: {7}
- Node 7: {5, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {3, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 7, 8}

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- For Node 2, there are 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <2, (3, 4, 5)>
- For Node 3, there are 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <3, (2, 5, 8)>
- For Node 4, there are 2 neighbors, not enough to form a 3-star.
- For Node 5, there are 5 neighbors, so it forms 10 3-stars: <5, (0, 2, 3)>, <5, (0, 2, 4)>, <5, (0, 2, 7)>, <5, (0, 3, 4)>, <5, (0, 3, 7)>, <5, (0, 4, 7)>, <5, (2, 3, 4)>, <5, (2, 3, 7)>, <5, (2, 4, 7)>, <5, (3, 4, 7)>
- For Node 7, there are 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars: <7, (5, 8, 9)>, <7, (6, 8, 9)>, <7, (6, 8, 3)>, <7, (6, 8, 5)>
- For Node 8, there are 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <8, (3, 7, 9)>
- For Node 9, there are 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <9, (1, 7, 8)>

In total, there are 19 3-stars: [19].
The unique 3-stars found are: <2, (3, 4, 5)>, <3, (2, 5, 8)>, <5, (0, 2, 3)>, <5, (0, 2, 4)>, <5, (0, 2, 7)>, <5, (0, 3, 4)>, <5, (0, 3, 7)>, <5, (0, 4, 7)>, <5, (2, 3, 4)>, <5, (2, 3, 7)>, <5, (2, 4, 7)>, <5, (3, 4, 7)>, <7, (5, 8, 9)>, <7, (6, 8, 9)>, <7, (6, 8, 3)>, <7, (6, 8, 5)>, <8, (3, 7, 9)>, <9, (1, 7, 8)>
