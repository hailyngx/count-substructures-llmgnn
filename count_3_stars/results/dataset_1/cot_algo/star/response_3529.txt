Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: neighbors {3, 9}
- Node 1: neighbors {2, 3, 4, 6}
- Node 2: neighbors {1, 4, 8}
- Node 3: neighbors {0, 1, 6, 8}
- Node 4: neighbors {1, 2}
- Node 5: neighbor {8}
- Node 6: neighbors {1, 3, 8}
- Node 8: neighbors {2, 3, 5, 6}
- Node 9: neighbor {0}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and find the number of 3-stars they form:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 13 \)

Therefore, the final result is [13] and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (2, 4, 6)>
- <1, (2, 4, 8)>
- <1, (3, 6, 8)>
- <1, (4, 6, 8)>
- <2, (1, 4, 8)>
- <3, (1, 6, 8)>
- <8, (2, 3, 6)>
- <8, (2, 3, 5)>
- <8, (2, 5, 6)>
- <8, (3, 5, 6)>
