Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Based on the given information, the neighbor set for each node is as follows:

- Node 0 neighbors: 9
- Node 1 neighbors: 7, 8
- Node 2 neighbors: 4
- Node 3 neighbors: 5
- Node 4 neighbors: 2, 5, 9
- Node 5 neighbors: 3, 4, 8
- Node 6 neighbors: 7
- Node 7 neighbors: 1, 6, 8, 9
- Node 8 neighbors: 1, 5, 7, 9
- Node 9 neighbors: 0, 4, 7, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

- Node 1 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars is 12.

Therefore, the final result is [12] and the unique 3-stars found are:

<7, (1, 8, 9)>
<8, (1, 5, 7)>
<8, (1, 7, 9)>
<8, (5, 7, 9)>
<9, (4, 7, 8)>
