Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 3, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 1: {4, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 4, 7}
- Node 3: {0, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 3}
- Node 5: {0, 3, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 5}
- Node 8: {0, 3, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 3, 5, 6, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 3, and Node 5 have 5 neighbors.
- Node 1 and Node 9 have 5 neighbors as well.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
For Node 0, the total number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For Node 3, the total number of 3-stars = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
For Node 5, the total number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For Node 1, the total number of 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
For Node 9, the total number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding them up: 10 + 20 + 10 + 1 + 10 = 51

So, the total number of 3-stars is [51], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 5, 8)>
<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<3, (0, 5, 9)>
<5, (0, 3, 6)>
<1, (4, 7, 9)>
<9, (1, 5, 8)>
