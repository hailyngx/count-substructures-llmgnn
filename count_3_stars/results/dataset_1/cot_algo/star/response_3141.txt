Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (2, 0) (2, 8) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 6, 7
- Node 2: 0, 8
- Node 5: 7
- Node 6: 0, 7
- Node 7: 0, 5, 6, 8
- Node 8: 2, 7, 9
- Node 9: 8

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed at each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 7: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
- <0, 2, 6>
- <7, 5, 8>
- <7, 6, 8>
- <7, 8, 9>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
