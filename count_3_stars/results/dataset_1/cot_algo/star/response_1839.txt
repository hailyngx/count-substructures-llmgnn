Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
This graph can be visualized as follows:

```
   0
  / \
 2   3
 | \
 5   6
     / \
    1   4
     \ /
      9
      |
      7
      |
      8
```

We can now find the 3-star configurations. 
Node 0 has neighbors {2, 3}, so it does not form a 3-star.
Node 1 has neighbors {4, 6, 9}, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 2 has neighbors {0, 5, 6, 9}, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 4 has neighbors {1, 6}, so it does not form a 3-star.
Node 5 has neighbors {2, 7}, so it does not form a 3-star.
Node 6 has neighbors {1, 2, 4}, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 7 has neighbors {5, 8}, so it does not form a 3-star.
Node 8 has neighbors {7}, so it does not form a 3-star.
Node 9 has neighbors {1, 2}, so it does not form a 3-star.

Adding up the 3-stars found, we get a total of [2]. 
The unique 3-stars are <1, (4, 6, 9)> and <2, (0, 5, 6)>.
