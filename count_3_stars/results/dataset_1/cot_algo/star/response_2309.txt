Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 3, 7
- Node 1: 7, 8
- Node 2: 9
- Node 3: 0, 4, 6, 8
- Node 4: 3, 7
- Node 5: 6, 7, 8
- Node 6: 3, 5, 9
- Node 7: 0, 1, 4, 5, 8
- Node 8: 1, 3, 5, 7
- Node 9: 2, 6

Next, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 3: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 7: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 8: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars

Summing these up, we have 4 + 10 + 4 = 18 3-stars, which can be listed as follows:
<[3, (0, 4, 6)]>
<[3, (0, 4, 8)]>
<[3, (0, 6, 8)]>
<[3, (4, 6, 8)]>
<[7, (0, 1, 4)]>
<[7, (0, 1, 5)]>
<[7, (0, 1, 8)]>
<[7, (0, 4, 5)]>
<[7, (0, 4, 8)]>
<[7, (0, 5, 8)]>
<[7, (1, 4, 5)]>
<[7, (1, 4, 8)]>
<[7, (1, 5, 8)]>
<[7, (4, 5, 8)]>
<[8, (1, 3, 5)]>
<[8, (1, 3, 7)]>
<[8, (1, 5, 7)]>
<[8, (3, 5, 7)]>

Therefore, the final answer is [18].
