Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 6, 7
- Node 1: 5, 8
- Node 2: 0, 5, 6
- Node 3: 9
- Node 4: 5, 7
- Node 5: 1, 2, 4, 9
- Node 6: 0, 2
- Node 7: 0, 4, 8
- Node 8: 1, 7, 9
- Node 9: 3, 5, 8

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
For Node 0, there are 3 neighbors, hence \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
For Node 2, there are 3 neighbors, hence \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
For Node 5, there are 4 neighbors, hence \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
For Node 7, there are 3 neighbors, hence \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
For Node 8, there are 3 neighbors, hence \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
For Node 9, there are 3 neighbors, hence \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 9

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [9].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (2, 6, 7)>
- <2, (0, 5, 6)>
- <5, (1, 4, 9)>
- <7, (0, 4, 8)>
- <8, (1, 7, 9)>
- <9, (3, 5, 8)>
