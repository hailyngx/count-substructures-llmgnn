Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 5, 9
- Node 1: 0, 3, 6, 8
- Node 2: 9
- Node 3: 1, 4, 6
- Node 4: 0, 3, 6, 7
- Node 5: 0, 8
- Node 6: 1, 3, 4, 7, 9
- Node 7: 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 8: 1, 5, 7, 9
- Node 9: 0, 2, 6, 7, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 5 (can form a 3-star with 1, 4, 5) 
- Node 1: 0, 3, 6 (can form a 3-star with 0, 3, 6) 
- Node 4: 0, 3, 6, 7 (can form 3-stars with 0, 3, 6 and 0, 4, 7) 
- Node 6: 1, 3, 4, 7, 9 (can form 3-stars with 1, 3, 6 and 4, 6, 7) 
- Node 7: 4, 6, 8, 9 (can form a 3-star with 4, 7, 9) 
- Node 8: 1, 5, 7, 9 (can form a 3-star with 7, 8, 9) 
- Node 9: 0, 2, 6, 7, 8 (can form a 3-star with 7, 8, 9) 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 7, and the unique 3-stars are:
<[0, 1, 4], [0, 1, 5], [0, 3, 6], [0, 4, 7], [1, 3, 6], [4, 6, 7], [7, 8, 9]>
