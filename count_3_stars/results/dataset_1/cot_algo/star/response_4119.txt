Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 1: {2, 3, 4, 6}
- Node 2: {1, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 5}
- Node 4: {1, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 5: {3, 4}
- Node 6: {1, 4, 8}
- Node 8: {4, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {2, 8}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 1 = 9

Therefore, the final answer is [9] and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<1, (3, 4, 6)>
<1, (4, 5, 6)>
<1, (4, 6, 8)>
<3, (1, 4, 5)>
<4, (1, 5, 6)>
<4, (1, 6, 8)>
<4, (5, 6, 8)>
<6, (1, 4, 8)>
