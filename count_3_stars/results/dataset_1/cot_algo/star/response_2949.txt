Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 3, 4, 7, 8
- Node 1: 5, 6
- Node 2: 7
- Node 3: 0, 7
- Node 4: 0, 6, 7, 8
- Node 5: 1, 6
- Node 6: 1, 4, 5, 8, 9
- Node 7: 0, 2, 3, 4, 8
- Node 8: 0, 4, 6, 7, 9
- Node 9: 6, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

Node 0 forms 1 3-star due to having exactly 3 neighbors: <0, (3, 4, 7)>
Node 4 forms 4 3-stars due to having exactly 3 neighbors: 
<4, (0, 6, 7)>, <4, (0, 7, 8)>, <4, (6, 7, 8)>, <4, (0, 4, 8)>
Node 6 forms 1 3-star due to having exactly 3 neighbors: <6, (1, 8, 9)>
Node 7 forms 1 3-star due to having exactly 3 neighbors: <7, (2, 4, 8)>
Node 8 forms 1 3-star due to having exactly 3 neighbors: <8, (4, 6, 9)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
