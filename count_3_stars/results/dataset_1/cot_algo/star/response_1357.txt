Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The neighbors for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 7, 8
- Node 1: 0, 5, 6, 9
- Node 2: 8
- Node 3: 4
- Node 4: 0, 3, 6
- Node 5: 1, 9
- Node 6: 1, 4
- Node 7: 0
- Node 8: 0, 2, 9
- Node 9: 1, 5, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding these up, we get a total of 10 3-stars in this graph.
Therefore, the answer is [10] and the unique 3-stars found are <0, (1, 4, 8)>, <1, (0, 5, 6)>, <4, (0, 3, 6)>, <8, (0, 2, 9)>.
