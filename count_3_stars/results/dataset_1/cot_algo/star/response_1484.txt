Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 4, 7
- Node 1: 3, 4, 8, 9
- Node 2: 0, 3, 8, 9
- Node 3: 0, 1, 2, 6, 9
- Node 4: 0, 1
- Node 5: 6, 7, 9
- Node 6: 3, 5, 8, 9
- Node 7: 0, 5, 8
- Node 8: 1, 2, 6, 7
- Node 9: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 0 as the center.
- Node 1: has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 1 as the center.
- Node 2: has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 2 as the center.
- Node 3: has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 3 as the center.
- Node 6: has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 6 as the center.
- Node 9: has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 9 as the center.

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 36

Therefore, the final answer is [36] and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 4, 7)>, <1, (3, 4, 8)>, <2, (0, 3, 8)>, <3, (0, 1, 2)>, <6, (3, 5, 8)>, <9, (1, 2, 5)>
