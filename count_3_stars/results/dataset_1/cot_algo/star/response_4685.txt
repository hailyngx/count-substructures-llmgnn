Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 4, 7, 8
- Node 1: 0, 9
- Node 2: 0, 5, 6, 7, 8
- Node 3: 5, 7
- Node 4: 0, 6, 7, 8
- Node 5: 2, 3, 7
- Node 6: 2, 4, 9
- Node 7: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8
- Node 8: 0, 2, 4, 7
- Node 9: 1, 6

Next, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars is 10 + 10 + 4 + 20 = 44, so we will write the final answer as [44].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (1, 7, 8)>
- <0, (2, 4, 8)>
- <2, (0, 4, 7)>
- <2, (5, 6, 8)>
- <4, (0, 6, 7)>
- <7, (0, 2, 8)>
