Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 3
- Node 1: 0, 4, 6
- Node 2: 0, 3, 4
- Node 3: 0, 2, 8, 9
- Node 4: 1, 2, 7
- Node 5: 6
- Node 6: 1, 5, 7, 8, 9
- Node 7: 4, 6
- Node 8: 3, 6
- Node 9: 3, 6

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) for nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: No 3-star (only 3 neighbors)
- Node 1: No 3-star (only 3 neighbors)
- Node 2: 1 3-star
- Node 3: 1 3-star
- Node 4: No 3-star (only 3 neighbors)
- Node 6: 1 3-star

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( [1 + 1 + 1] = 3 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 3. The unique 3-stars are:
- <2, (0, 3, 4)>
- <3, (0, 2, 4)>
- <6, (1, 7, 8)>
