Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {4}
- Node 1: {6, 9}
- Node 2: {4}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {8}
- Node 6: {1, 4}
- Node 7: {8}
- Node 8: {4, 5, 7}
- Node 9: {1, 4}

Next, we will identify the 3-stars formed by each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 4 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars: <4, (0, 2, 6)>, <4, (0, 2, 8)>, <4, (0, 2, 9)>, <4, (0, 6, 8)>, <4, (0, 6, 9)>, <4, (0, 8, 9)>, <4, (2, 6, 8)>, <4, (2, 6, 9)>, <4, (2, 8, 9)>, <4, (6, 8, 9)>

In this case, the total number of 3-stars is [10].
