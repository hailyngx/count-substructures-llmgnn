Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 6
- Node 1: 0, 8, 9
- Node 2: 0, 4, 7
- Node 3: 4, 8
- Node 4: 2, 3, 7
- Node 5: 9
- Node 6: 0, 9
- Node 7: 2, 4
- Node 8: 1, 3
- Node 9: 1, 5, 6

Next, we'll identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 6 (3 neighbors)
- Node 1: 0, 8, 9 (3 neighbors)
- Node 2: 0, 4, 7 (3 neighbors)
- Node 4: 2, 3, 7 (3 neighbors)
- Node 9: 1, 5, 6 (3 neighbors)

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars formed with the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 5

Therefore, the final answer is [5] and the unique 3-stars found are: <0, (1, 2, 6)>, <1, (0, 8, 9)>, <2, (0, 4, 7)>, <4, (2, 3, 7)>, <9, (1, 5, 6)>.
