Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 6, 7}
- Node 1: {5, 9}
- Node 2: {0}
- Node 3: {9}
- Node 4: {8}
- Node 5: {1}
- Node 6: {0}
- Node 7: {0, 9}
- Node 8: {4}
- Node 9: {1, 3, 7}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \[1 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 2\]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 2.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 6, 7)>
<9, (1, 3, 7)>
