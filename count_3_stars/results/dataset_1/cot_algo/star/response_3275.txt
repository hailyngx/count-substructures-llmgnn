Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 6, 8
- Node 1: 0, 3, 6, 7
- Node 2: 0, 5, 6, 7, 8
- Node 3: 1, 5
- Node 4: 5, 6, 8
- Node 5: 2, 3, 4, 6, 7
- Node 6: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 8
- Node 7: 1, 2, 5, 8
- Node 8: 0, 2, 4, 6, 7

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- For node 0, inom{4}{3} = 4, so there are [] = 4 3-stars:
  <0, (1, 2, 6)>, <0, (1, 6, 8)>, <0, (2, 6, 8)>, <0, (6, 8, 2)>
- For node 1, inom{4}{3} = 4, so there are [] = 4 3-stars:
  <1, (0, 3, 6)>, <1, (0, 6, 7)>, <1, (3, 6, 7)>, <1, (6, 7, 0)>
- For node 2, inom{5}{3} = 10, so there are [] = 10 3-stars:
  <2, (0, 5, 6)>, <2, (0, 6, 7)>, <2, (0, 6, 8)>, <2, (5, 6, 7)>, <2, (5, 6, 8)>, <2, (5, 7, 8)>, <2, (6, 7, 8)>, <2, (6, 8, 0)>, <2, (6, 8, 7)>, <2, (7, 8, 0)>
- For node 4, inom{3}{3} = 1, so there is [] = 1 3-star:
  <4, (5, 6, 8)>
- For node 5, inom{5}{3} = 10, so there are [] = 10 3-stars:
  <5, (2, 3, 6)>, <5, (2, 4, 6)>, <5, (2, 6, 7)>, <5, (2, 6, 8)>, <5, (3, 4, 6)>, <5, (3, 6, 7)>, <5, (3, 6, 8)>, <5, (4, 6, 7)>, <5, (4, 6, 8)>, <5, (6, 7, 8)>
- For node 6, inom{6}{3} = 20, so there are [] = 20 3-stars:
  <6, (0, 1, 2)>, <6, (0, 1, 4)>, <6, (0, 1, 5)>, <6, (0, 2, 5)>, <6, (0, 4, 8)>, <6, (0, 5, 8)>, <6, (1, 2, 7)>, <6, (1, 7, 8)>, <6, (2, 7, 8)>, <6, (4, 5, 8)>, <6, (5, 7, 8)>, <6, (1, 2, 0)>, <6, (1, 4, 0)>, <6, (1, 5, 0)>, <6, (2, 5, 0)>, <6, (4, 8, 0)>, <6, (5, 8, 0)>, <6, (2, 7, 1)>, <6, (7, 8, 1)>, <6, (7, 8, 2)>
- For node 7, inom{4}{3} = 4, so there are [] = 4 3-stars:
  <7, (1, 2, 5)>, <7, (1, 5, 8)>, <7, (2, 5, 8)>, <7, (5, 8, 1)>
- For node 8, inom{5}{3} = 10, so there are [] = 10 3-stars:
  <8, (0, 4, 6)>, <8, (0, 6, 7)>, <8, (0, 6, 7)>, <8, (2, 4, 6)>, <8, (2, 6, 7)>, <8, (2, 7, 5)>, <8, (4, 6, 7)>, <8, (4, 6, 7)>, <8, (4, 7, 5)>, <8, (6, 7, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [49], and the unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (1, 2, 6)>, <0, (1, 6, 8)>, <0, (2, 6, 8)>, <1, (0, 3, 6)>, <1, (0, 6, 7)>, <1, (3, 6, 7)>, <2, (0, 5, 6)>, <2, (0, 6, 7)>, <2, (0, 6, 8)>, <4, (5, 6, 8)>, <5, (2, 3, 6)>, <5, (2, 4, 6)>, <5, (2, 6, 7)>, <5, (2, 6, 8)>, <5, (3, 4, 6)>, <5, (3, 6, 7)>, <5, (3, 6, 8)>, <5, (4, 6, 7)>, <5, (4, 6, 8)>, <5, (6, 7, 8)>, <6, (0, 1, 2)>, <6, (0, 1, 4)>, <6, (0, 1, 5)>, <6, (0, 2, 5)>, <6, (0, 4, 8)>, <6, (0, 5, 8)>, <6, (1, 2, 7)>, <6, (1, 7, 8)>, <6, (2, 7, 8)>, <6, (4, 5, 8)>, <6, (5, 7, 8)>, <7, (1, 2, 5)>, <7, (1, 5, 8)>, <7, (2, 5, 8)>, <7, (5, 8, 1)>, <8, (0, 4, 6)>, <8, (0, 6, 7)>, <8, (2, 4, 6)>, <8, (2, 6, 7)>, <8, (2, 7, 5)>, <8, (4, 6, 7)>, <8, (4, 7, 5)>, <8, (6, 7, 5)>, <8, (6, 7, 8)>
