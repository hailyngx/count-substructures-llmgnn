Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 5, 9
- Node 1: 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
- Node 2: 0, 7, 9
- Node 3: 1
- Node 4: 1, 5, 8
- Node 5: 0, 1, 4, 9
- Node 6: 1, 9
- Node 7: 1, 2, 8
- Node 8: 4, 7, 9
- Node 9: 0, 2, 5, 6, 8

Next, we will identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 4 neighbors
- Node 1: 6 neighbors
- Node 2: 3 neighbors
- Node 4: 3 neighbors
- Node 5: 4 neighbors
- Node 7: 3 neighbors
- Node 8: 3 neighbors
- Node 9: 5 neighbors

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is 4 + 20 + 4 + 10 = 38, which we will represent inside brackets as [38].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (1, 5, 9)>
- <1, (0, 4, 5)>
- <1, (4, 5, 6)>
- <1, (5, 6, 7)>
- <1, (5, 7, 8)>
- <1, (5, 7, 9)>
- <1, (6, 7, 9)>
- <1, (7, 8, 9)>
- <5, (0, 1, 9)>
- <5, (4, 0, 9)>
- <9, (0, 5, 2)>
- <9, (0, 6, 2)>
- <9, (2, 6, 0)>
- <9, (2, 6, 5)>
- <9, (5, 0, 6)>
- <9, (5, 6, 2)>
- <9, (6, 0, 2)>
- <9, (6, 5, 0)>
