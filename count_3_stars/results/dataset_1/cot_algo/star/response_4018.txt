Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: Neighbors {8}
- Node 1: Neighbors {2, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {1, 8}
- Node 3: Neighbors {6, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 6, 8}
- Node 5: Neighbors {6, 7, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 3, 4, 5}
- Node 7: Neighbors {5}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 2, 4}
- Node 9: Neighbors {1, 3, 5}

Now we will check each node to see if it can form a 3-star based on its neighbor set and count the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 1: Inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 4: Inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 6: Inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 8: Inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 9: Inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: [11]

Unique 3-stars found:
- <1, (2, 4, 6)>
- <1, (2, 6, 9)>
- <1, (4, 6, 9)>
- <1, (6, 8, 9)>
- <4, (1, 6, 9)>
- <6, (1, 4, 5)>
- <6, (1, 5, 9)>
- <6, (3, 4, 5)>
- <6, (3, 5, 9)>
- <8, (2, 4, 6)>
- <9, (1, 3, 5)>
