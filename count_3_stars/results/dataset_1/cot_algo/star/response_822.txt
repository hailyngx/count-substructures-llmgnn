Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {1, 3, 7}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 2: {1, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 1}
- Node 4: {1, 9}
- Node 5: {6}
- Node 6: {5}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {4, 7, 8}

Now, we will identify the 3-star configurations:
- Node 0: No 3-star (Has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 1: No 3-star (Has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 2: No 3-star (Has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 3: No 3-star (Has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 4: No 3-star (Has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 5: No 3-star (Has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 6: No 3-star (Has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 7: <7, (0, 1, 8)>, <7, (0, 1, 9)>, <7, (1, 8, 9)>
- Node 8: <8, (1, 2, 7)>, <8, (1, 7, 9)>, <8, (2, 7, 9)>
- Node 9: No 3-star (Has less than 3 neighbors)

Count of 3-stars = [6]

Unique 3-stars:
<7, (0, 1, 8)>, <7, (0, 1, 9)>, <7, (1, 8, 9)>, <8, (1, 2, 7)>, <8, (1, 7, 9)>, <8, (2, 7, 9)>
