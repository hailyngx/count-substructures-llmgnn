Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) 

Response:
Firstly, let's find the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 7, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 3, 7, 8}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 4}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 4}
- Node 4: {2, 3, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 5: {4}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 4}
- Node 8: {1, 4}
- Node 9: {0}

Now, let's determine the 3-stars:

- Node 0: has 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star
- Node 1: has 5 neighbors -> 10 3-stars
- Node 2: has 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star
- Node 3: has 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star
- Node 4: has 5 neighbors -> 10 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 23

Therefore, the final answer is [23] and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 7, 9)>
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<1, (0, 2, 8)>
<1, (0, 3, 7)>
<1, (0, 7, 8)>
<1, (2, 3, 4)>
<1, (2, 4, 8)>
<1, (3, 4, 8)>
<1, (7, 4, 8)>
<4, (2, 3, 5)>
<4, (2, 5, 7)>
<4, (3, 5, 7)>
<4, (4, 5, 7)>
<4, (7, 5, 8)>
<4, (7, 8, 1)>
<4, (8, 1, 2)>
<4, (8, 1, 3)>
<4, (8, 2, 3)>
<4, (8, 2, 7)>
<4, (8, 3, 7)>
