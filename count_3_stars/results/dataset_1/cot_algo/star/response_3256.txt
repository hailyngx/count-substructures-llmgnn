Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 28 edges, we will first determine the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 3, 4}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {3, 7}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 2, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 5, 6}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 4, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbor {4}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 2, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 3}
- Node 9: Neighbors {1, 5, 7}

Now, we will identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes (0, 4, 5): <1, (0, 4, 5)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes (5, 7, 9): <1, (5, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
