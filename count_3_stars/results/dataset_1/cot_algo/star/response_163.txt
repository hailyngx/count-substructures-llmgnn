Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 5, 7
- Node 2: 0, 7
- Node 3: 0, 5, 8
- Node 5: 0, 3, 7
- Node 7: 0, 2, 5, 8
- Node 8: 3, 7

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4 + 1 = 5].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <0, (2, 5, 7)>, <0, (3, 5, 7)>, <0, (5, 7, 8)>, <0, (2, 7, 8)>, <3, (5, 7, 8)>.
