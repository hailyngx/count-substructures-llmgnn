Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
The neighbors for each node are:
- Node 0: 1
- Node 1: 0, 2, 9
- Node 2: 1, 6, 7, 9
- Node 3: 7
- Node 4: 5, 6
- Node 5: 4
- Node 6: 2, 4, 8
- Node 7: 2, 3, 8
- Node 8: 6, 7
- Node 9: 1, 2

Node 1, 2, 6, and 7 each have 3 or more neighbors, so we can form 3-stars with them.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1 has \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2 has \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6 has \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7 has \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 7

Therefore, the final answer is [7] and the unique 3-stars are <1, (0, 2, 9)>, <2, (1, 6, 7)>, <6, (2, 4, 8)>, <7, (2, 3, 8)>
