Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the number of neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 1 neighbor (node 1)
- Node 1: 4 neighbors (nodes 0, 2, 3)
- Node 2: 6 neighbors (nodes 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)
- Node 3: 4 neighbors (nodes 1, 6, 7, 8)
- Node 4: 1 neighbor (node 6)
- Node 5: 1 neighbor (node 2)
- Node 6: 5 neighbors (nodes 2, 3, 4, 9)
- Node 7: 2 neighbors (nodes 2, 3)
- Node 8: 2 neighbors (nodes 2, 3)
- Node 9: 2 neighbors (nodes 2, 6)

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Now sum up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 20 + 4 + 10 = 38

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [38].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

1. <2, (1, 7, 8)>
2. <2, (1, 7, 9)>
3. <2, (3, 7, 8)>
4. <2, (3, 7, 9)>
5. <2, (6, 7, 8)>
6. <2, (6, 7, 9)>
7. <2, (3, 8, 9)>
8. <2, (6, 8, 9)>
9. <1, (0, 2, 3)>
10. <1, (0, 2, 6)>
11. <1, (0, 3, 6)>
12. <1, (2, 5, 6)>
13. <1, (2, 6, 9)>
14. <1, (3, 6, 9)>
15. <3, (2, 6, 7)>
16. <6, (2, 3, 4)>
17. <6, (2, 3, 9)>
18. <6, (3, 4, 9)>
19. <6, (6, 4, 9)>
