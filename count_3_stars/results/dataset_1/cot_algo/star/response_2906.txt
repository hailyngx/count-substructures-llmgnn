Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 3, 5, 7
- Node 1: 2, 3, 5, 6
- Node 2: 1, 7, 8, 9
- Node 3: 0, 1, 4, 8
- Node 4: 3, 8
- Node 5: 0, 1
- Node 6: 1, 7, 9
- Node 7: 0, 2, 6
- Node 8: 2, 3, 4, 9
- Node 9: 2, 6, 8

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

The total number of 3-stars is 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 19, so we have [19].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (3, 5, 7)>
- <1, (2, 3, 5)>
- <1, (2, 3, 6)>
- <1, (2, 5, 6)>
- <1, (3, 5, 6)>
- <4, (3, 8, 4)>
- <8, (2, 3, 4)>
