Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Firstly, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: neighbors = {1, 7}
- Node 1: neighbors = {0, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 3: neighbors = {4, 9}
- Node 4: neighbors = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 5: neighbors = {4, 8}
- Node 6: neighbors = {1, 9}
- Node 7: neighbors = {0, 1, 4}
- Node 8: neighbors = {5, 9}
- Node 9: neighbors = {3, 4, 6, 8}

Now, let's check how many 3-stars can be formed:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars

In total, there are 4 + 10 + 4 = 18 3-stars in this graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (0, 6, 7)>
<1, (4, 6, 7)>
<1, (4, 7, 9)>
<1, (6, 7, 9)>
<(0, 1, 7), 4>
<(0, 1, 7), 6>
<4, (1, 5, 7)>
<4, (1, 7, 9)>
<4, (5, 7, 8)>
<4, (5, 7, 9)>
<4, (7, 8, 9)>
<4, (7, 9, 6)>
<(3, 4, 9), 1>
<(3, 4, 9), 7>
<9, (4, 6, 8)>
<9, (4, 8, 5)>
<9, (4, 8, 9)>
<9, (6, 8, 5)> 

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [18].
