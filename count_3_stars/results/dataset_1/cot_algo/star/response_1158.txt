Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we can first identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {2}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 5}
- Node 3: {2, 6}
- Node 4: {6, 7, 8}
- Node 5: {2}
- Node 6: {3, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {4, 6, 9}
- Node 8: {4, 6}
- Node 9: {7}

Now, we will look at the nodes with three or more neighbors to form 3-stars:

- Node 2 forms a 3-star: <2, (0, 3, 5)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star: <4, (6, 7, 8)>
- Node 6 forms two 3-stars: <6, (3, 4, 7)> and <6, (4, 7, 8)>

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4].
