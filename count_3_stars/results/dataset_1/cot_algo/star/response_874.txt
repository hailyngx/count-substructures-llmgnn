Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0 neighbors: 1, 2, 5, 6
- Node 1 neighbors: 0, 5, 6, 8, 9
- Node 2 neighbors: 0, 7, 8, 9
- Node 3 neighbors: 4, 5, 8
- Node 4 neighbors: 3, 5, 6
- Node 5 neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9
- Node 6 neighbors: 0, 1, 4, 5, 9
- Node 7 neighbors: 2, 5, 9
- Node 8 neighbors: 1, 2, 3
- Node 9 neighbors: 1, 2, 5, 6, 7

Now let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes: 5, 6, 9
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes: 5, 7, 9

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2], and the unique 3-stars found are: <<1, 5, 6, 9>, <2, 5, 7, 9>>.
