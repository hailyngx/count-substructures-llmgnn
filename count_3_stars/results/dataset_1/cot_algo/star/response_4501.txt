Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph in a clearer way:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 6.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 8, 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 5, 6, 7.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 6, 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 2.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 7, 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 6, 9.
- Node 8 is connected to node 1.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 6, 7.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars based on the given graph:

For each node, let's find its neighbors:
- Node 0: 4, 5, 6
- Node 1: 2, 4, 8, 9
- Node 2: 1, 4, 5, 6, 7
- Node 3: 6, 9
- Node 4: 0, 1, 2
- Node 5: 0, 2
- Node 6: 0, 2, 3, 7, 9
- Node 7: 2, 6, 9
- Node 8: 1
- Node 9: 1, 3, 6, 7

Applying the combination formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) for nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: Not applicable (has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 1: Not applicable (has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 2: Not applicable (has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 3: Not applicable (has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 4: <4, (0, 1, 2)>
- Node 5: Not applicable (has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 6: <6, (0, 2, 7)>
- Node 7: Not applicable (has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 8: Not applicable (has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 9: <9, (1, 6, 7)>, <9, (3, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3]. The unique 3-stars found are: <4, (0, 1, 2)>, <6, (0, 2, 7)>, <9, (1, 6, 7)>, <9, (3, 6, 7)>.
