Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 1, 5, 9  
Node 1: 0  
Node 2: 6, 8  
Node 4: 5, 6, 7, 8  
Node 5: 0, 4, 9  
Node 6: 2, 4, 8  
Node 7: 4  
Node 8: 2, 4, 6  
Node 9: 0, 5  

Now, we need to calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  

The total number of 3-stars is 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 8, so we have [8].

The unique 3-stars found are <0, (1, 5, 9)>, <4, (5, 6, 7)>, <4, (5, 6, 8)>, <4, (6, 7, 8)>, and <5, (0, 4, 9)>.
