Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 2
- Node 1: 2, 7, 9
- Node 2: 0, 1, 5, 7, 9
- Node 3: 4, 7
- Node 4: 3, 6, 8
- Node 5: 2, 6, 8
- Node 6: 4, 5
- Node 7: 1, 2, 3
- Node 8: 4, 5
- Node 9: 1, 2

Next, let's find the 3-stars:
- Node 1 can form 1 3-star: <1, (2, 7, 9)>
- Node 2 can form 1 3-star: <2, (1, 7, 9)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is [2].
