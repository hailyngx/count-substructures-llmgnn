Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 32 edges, here is the calculation for the 3-stars:

1. Node 0: (0, 7)
   - Neighbors: 7
   - No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.

2. Node 1: (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 7)
   - Neighbors: 2, 3, 7
   - 3-star: <1, (2, 3, 7)>

3. Node 2: (2, 1), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 8)
   - Neighbors: 1, 4, 5, 6, 8
   - 3-star: <2, (1, 4, 5)>, <2, (1, 4, 6)>, <2, (1, 5, 6)>, <2, (4, 5, 6)>, <2, (4, 5, 8)>, <2, (4, 6, 8)>, <2, (5, 6, 8)>

4. Node 3: (3, 1)
   - Neighbors: 1
   - No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.

5. Node 4: (4, 2), (4, 6), (4, 8)
   - Neighbors: 2, 6, 8
   - 3-star: <4, (2, 6, 8)>

6. Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 have more than 3 neighbors each, so we need to apply the combinatorial calculation to find the 3-stars:
   - Total number of 3-stars for node 5: [inom{1}{3}] = 0
   - Total number of 3-stars for node 6: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
     - 3-star: <6, (2, 4, 8)>, <6, (2, 8, 9)>, <6, (4, 8, 9)>, <6, (7, 8, 9)>
   - Total number of 3-stars for node 7: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
     - 3-star: <7, (1, 6, 8)>, <7, (1, 6, 9)>, <7, (6, 8, 9)>, <7, (7, 8, 9)>
   - Total number of 3-stars for node 8: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
     - 3-star: <8, (4, 6, 7)>
   - Total number of 3-stars for node 9: [inom{2}{3}] = 0

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 7 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 0 + 0] = [17].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <1, (2, 3, 7)>
- <2, (1, 4, 5)>
- <2, (1, 4, 6)>
- <2, (1, 5, 6)>
- <2, (4, 5, 6)>
- <2, (4, 5, 8)>
- <2, (4, 6, 8)>
- <2, (5, 6, 8)>
- <4, (2, 6, 8)>
- <6, (2, 4, 8)>
- <6, (2, 8, 9)>
- <6, (4, 8, 9)>
- <6, (7, 8, 9)>
- <7, (1, 6, 8)>
- <7, (1, 6, 9)>
- <7, (6, 8, 9)>
- <7, (7, 8, 9)>
- <8, (4, 6, 7)>
