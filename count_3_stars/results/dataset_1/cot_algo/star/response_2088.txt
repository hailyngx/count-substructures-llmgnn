Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's summarize the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 4, 8
- Node 1: 0, 6, 8
- Node 2: 0, 6, 7, 9
- Node 3: 6, 8
- Node 4: 0
- Node 6: 1, 2, 3
- Node 7: 2
- Node 8: 0, 1, 3, 9
- Node 9: 2, 8

Now, we'll examine each node that has three or more neighbors and check for the formation of 3-stars:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, which is 4 choose 3 = 4 possible 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, which is 4 choose 3 = 4 possible 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, which is 4 choose 3 = 4 possible 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars is 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 13, so the answer is [13].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 2, 9>
<1, 0, 8>
<2, 0, 6>
<2, 6, 3>
<8, 0, 1>
<8, 0, 3>
<8, 1, 6>
<8, 3, 6>
<8, 2, 9>
<9, 2, 8>
