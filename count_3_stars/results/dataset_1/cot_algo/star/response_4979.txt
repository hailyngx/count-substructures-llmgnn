Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 6, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 4, 5}
- Node 3: {8, 9}
- Node 4: {2, 8}
- Node 5: {2, 6, 9}
- Node 6: {1, 5}
- Node 7: {0}
- Node 8: {0, 3, 4}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 3, 5}

Now, we will check each node to see if they can form any 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors which is not enough to form a 3-star.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors which is not enough to form a 3-star.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors which is not enough to form a 3-star.
- Node 7 has only 1 neighbor which is not enough to form a 3-star.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 17

Therefore, the final count of 3-stars is [17].

Unique 3-stars:
- <0, (1, 8, 9)>
- <0, (2, 7, 8)>
- <0, (2, 8, 9)>
- <0, (5, 8, 9)>
- <0, (7, 8, 9)>
- <1, (0, 6, 9)>
- <2, (0, 4, 8)>
- <2, (0, 5, 8)>
- <5, (0, 2, 9)>
- <8, (0, 4, 9)>
- <9, (0, 1, 5)>
