Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: 1, 4, 5, 6 
- Node 1: 0, 8
- Node 2: 7
- Node 3: 6, 7
- Node 4: 0, 5, 8
- Node 5: 0, 4, 6
- Node 6: 0, 3, 5, 7, 8
- Node 7: 2, 3, 6
- Node 8: 1, 4, 6

Next, let's find the 3-stars in the graph:

Node 0: This node has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars. 
      There are 4 possible 3-stars: 
      <0, (1, 4, 5)>, <0, (1, 5, 6)>, <0, (4, 5, 6)>, <0, (5, 6, 8)>.
      
Node 4: This node has 3 neighbors, so it can form exactly 1 3-star: 
      <4, (0, 5, 8)>.
      
Node 5: This node has 3 neighbors, so it can form exactly 1 3-star: 
      <5, (0, 4, 6)>.
      
Node 6: This node has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars. 
      There are 10 possible 3-stars: 
      <6, (0, 3, 5)>, <6, (0, 5, 7)>, <6, (0, 5, 8)>, 
      <6, (3, 5, 7)>, <6, (3, 5, 8)>, <6, (5, 7, 8)>, 
      <6, (0, 5, 7)>, <6, (0, 7, 8)>, <6, (5, 7, 8)>, <6, (0, 7, 8)>.
      
Node 8: This node has 3 neighbors, so it can form exactly 1 3-star: 
      <8, (1, 4, 6)>.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: 
4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 17, which we write as [17].

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
<0, (1, 4, 5)>, <0, (1, 5, 6)>, <0, (4, 5, 6)>, <0, (5, 6, 8)>, 
<4, (0, 5, 8)>, <5, (0, 4, 6)>, 
<6, (0, 3, 5)>, <6, (0, 5, 7)>, <6, (0, 5, 8)>, 
<6, (3, 5, 7)>, <6, (3, 5, 8)>, <6, (5, 7, 8)>, 
<8, (1, 4, 6)>.
