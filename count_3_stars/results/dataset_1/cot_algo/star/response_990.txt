Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 5
- Node 1: 4
- Node 2: 0, 6, 9
- Node 3: 0, 6, 8, 9
- Node 4: 1, 7, 8
- Node 5: 0, 7, 8, 9
- Node 6: 2, 3
- Node 7: 4, 5, 8
- Node 8: 3, 4, 5, 7
- Node 9: 2, 3, 5

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star
- Node 2: 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star
- Node 3: 4 neighbors -> 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 5: 4 neighbors -> 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 8: 4 neighbors -> 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 9: 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: [1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1] = [15]

Unique 3-stars: 
<0, (2, 3, 5)>
<2, (0, 6, 9)>
<3, (0, 6, 8)>
<3, (0, 6, 9)>
<3, (6, 8, 9)>
<5, (0, 7, 8)>
<5, (7, 8, 9)>
<8, (3, 4, 5)>
<8, (3, 5, 7)>
<8, (4, 5, 7)>
<8, (5, 7, 9)>
