Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 4, 8, 9
- Node 1: 6
- Node 2: 5, 6, 8
- Node 3: 5, 7, 9
- Node 4: 0
- Node 5: 2, 3, 7, 9
- Node 6: 1, 2, 7, 8
- Node 7: 3, 5, 6
- Node 8: 0, 2, 6, 9
- Node 9: 0, 3, 5, 8

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

In total, there are 25 3-stars in this graph. 

Therefore, the final count inside brackets is [25], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 4, 8>
<2, 5, 6>
<3, 5, 9>
<6, 7, 8>
<8, 5, 9>
