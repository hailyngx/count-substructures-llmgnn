Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 7) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 20 edges, we can determine the 3-stars present in the graph as follows:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2 and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2 and 3.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, and 4.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 6, and 7.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2 and 7.
- Node 6 is connected to node 3.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 7.

Considering the neighbor sets for each node, we can see that nodes 2, 3, and 7 have three or more neighbors, thus they can form 3-stars.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 1 = 9

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [9], and the unique 3-stars found are <2, (0, 1, 3)>, <2, (0, 1, 4)>, <2, (0, 3, 4)>, <2, (1, 3, 4)>, <3, (1, 2, 6)>, <3, (1, 2, 7)>, <3, (2, 6, 7)>, <7, (3, 4, 9)>, <7, (4, 9, 0)>.
