Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first identify the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {4}
- Node 1: Neighbors {3, 6}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 4, 6}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 3, 5}
- Node 5: Neighbors {4, 6}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 3, 5, 7}
- Node 7: Neighbors {6}

Next, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 1: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star: <3, (1, 4, 6)>
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star: <4, (0, 3, 5)>
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star: <6, (1, 3, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3], and the unique 3-stars found are <3, (1, 4, 6)>, <4, (0, 3, 5)>, and <6, (1, 3, 5)>.
