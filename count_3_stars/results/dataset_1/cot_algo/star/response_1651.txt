Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 3, 4, 8
Node 1: 3, 7, 9
Node 2: 6, 7
Node 3: 0, 1, 5, 6
Node 4: 0
Node 5: 3
Node 6: 2, 3, 8, 9
Node 7: 1, 2
Node 8: 0, 6, 9
Node 9: 1, 6, 8

Now, let's check which nodes have three or more neighbors:
Node 0 has 3 neighbors
Node 1 has 3 neighbors
Node 2 has 2 neighbors
Node 3 has 4 neighbors
Node 6 has 4 neighbors
Node 8 has 3 neighbors
Node 9 has 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
Node 0 can form 1 3-star
Node 1 can form 1 3-star
Node 3 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 6 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 8 can form 1 3-star
Node 9 can form 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: [1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1] = [12]

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (3, 4, 8)>
<1, (3, 7, 9)>
<3, (0, 1, 5)>
<3, (0, 1, 6)>
<3, (1, 5, 6)>
<3, (0, 5, 6)>
<6, (2, 8, 9)>
<6, (3, 8, 9)>
<6, (0, 8, 9)>
<6, (1, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 6, 9)>
<9, (1, 6, 8)>
