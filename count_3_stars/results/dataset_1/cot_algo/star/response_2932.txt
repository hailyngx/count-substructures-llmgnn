Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 5, 6
- Node 1: 2, 8, 9
- Node 2: 1, 3, 6
- Node 3: 2, 4, 8
- Node 4: 3, 6, 7, 8
- Node 5: 0, 6
- Node 6: 0, 2, 4, 5, 8
- Node 7: 4
- Node 8: 1, 3, 4, 6
- Node 9: 1

Next, let's identify nodes that have 3 or more neighbors to form 3-stars:
- Node 1: 3 neighbors
- Node 2: 3 neighbors
- Node 3: 3 neighbors
- Node 4: 4 neighbors
- Node 6: 5 neighbors
- Node 8: 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with at least 3 neighbors:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 21 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [21], and the unique 3-stars found are: 
<1, (2, 8, 9)>
<2, (1, 3, 6)>
<3, (2, 4, 8)>
<4, (3, 6, 7)>
<6, (0, 2, 5)>
<8, (1, 3, 4)>
