Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 4, 8
- Node 2: 0, 7
- Node 3: 0, 6, 7
- Node 4: 0, 6
- Node 5: 9
- Node 6: 3, 4, 7, 9
- Node 7: 2, 3, 6
- Node 8: 0
- Node 9: 5, 6

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so there are [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars: <0, (2, 3, 4)>, <0, (2, 3, 8)>, <0, (2, 4, 8)>, <0, (3, 4, 8)>
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so only 1 3-star is formed: <3, (6, 7, 0)>
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so there are [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars: <6, (3, 4, 7)>, <6, (3, 4, 9)>, <6, (3, 7, 9)>, <6, (4, 7, 9)>
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4 + 1 + 4] = 9, and the unique 3-stars are <0, (2, 3, 4)>, <0, (2, 3, 8)>, <0, (2, 4, 8)>, <0, (3, 4, 8)>, <3, (6, 7, 0)>, <6, (3, 4, 7)>, <6, (3, 4, 9)>, <6, (3, 7, 9)>, <6, (4, 7, 9)>.
