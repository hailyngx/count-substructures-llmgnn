Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: neighbors are 5 and 9
- Node 1: neighbors are 3, 6, and 7
- Node 2: neighbors are 3, 4, and 8
- Node 3: neighbors are 1, 2, and 4
- Node 4: neighbors are 2, 3, 6, 7, and 9
- Node 5: neighbor is 0
- Node 6: neighbors are 1, 4, 7, and 9
- Node 7: neighbors are 1, 4, 6
- Node 8: neighbor is 2
- Node 9: neighbors are 0, 4, 6

Now, let's determine the 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <1, (3, 6, 7)>
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <2, (3, 4, 8)>
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <3, (1, 2, 4)>
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars:
  - <4, (2, 3, 6)>
  - <4, (2, 3, 7)>
  - <4, (2, 3, 9)>
  - <4, (2, 6, 7)>
  - <4, (2, 6, 9)>
  - <4, (2, 7, 9)>
  - <4, (3, 6, 7)>
  - <4, (3, 6, 9)>
  - <4, (3, 7, 9)>
  - <4, (6, 7, 9)>
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars:
  - <6, (1, 4, 7)>
  - <6, (1, 4, 9)>
  - <6, (1, 7, 9)>
  - <6, (4, 7, 9)>
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <9, (0, 4, 6)>

Total number of 3-stars in the graph: [1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1] = [18]
