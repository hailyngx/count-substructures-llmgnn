Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 28 edges, let's first find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbor of node 0 is 6.
- Node 1: Neighbors of node 1 are 3.
- Node 2: Neighbors of node 2 are 5, 7, 8, 9.
- Node 3: Neighbors of node 3 are 1, 4, 6, 9.
- Node 4: Neighbors of node 4 are 3, 5, 7.
- Node 5: Neighbors of node 5 are 2, 4, 8.
- Node 6: Neighbors of node 6 are 0, 3, 9.
- Node 7: Neighbors of node 7 are 2, 4.
- Node 8: Neighbors of node 8 are 2, 5, 9.
- Node 9: Neighbors of node 9 are 2, 3, 6, 8.

Now, let's identify any 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars. The 3-stars are:
  - <2, (5, 8, 9)>
  - <2, (7, 8, 9)>
  - <2, (5, 7, 8)>
  - <2, (5, 7, 9)>

- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars. The 3-stars are:
  - <3, (1, 4, 6)>
  - <3, (1, 4, 9)>
  - <3, (1, 6, 9)>
  - <3, (4, 6, 9)>

- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star:
  - <5, (2, 4, 8)>

- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star:
  - <6, (0, 3, 9)>

- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star:
  - <8, (2, 5, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1] = 11.
