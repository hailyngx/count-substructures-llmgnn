Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighborhood set for each node:
Node 0: {1, 2, 9}
Node 1: {0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8}
Node 2: {0, 1, 4, 7, 8}
Node 3: {1, 8}
Node 4: {2, 5, 7, 9}
Node 5: {1, 4, 9}
Node 6: {7}
Node 7: {1, 2, 4, 6, 9}
Node 8: {1, 2, 3, 9}
Node 9: {0, 4, 5, 7, 8}

Now, let's identify nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
Node 0, 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, and 9 have 3 or more neighbors.

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars they participate in:
Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding these up:
1 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 59

So, the total number of 3-stars is [59].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
<0, (1, 2, 9)>, <1, (0, 2, 5)>, <1, (0, 2, 7)>, <1, (0, 2, 8)>, <1, (2, 3, 5)>, 
<1, (2, 3, 7)>, <1, (2, 3, 8)>, <1, (5, 4, 9)>, <1, (7, 4, 9)>, <1, (8, 3, 9)>, 
<2, (0, 1, 4)>, <2, (0, 1, 7)>, <2, (0, 1, 8)>, <2, (1, 4, 7)>, <2, (1, 4, 9)>, 
<2, (7, 4, 9)>, <2, (8, 3, 9)>, <4, (2, 5, 7)>, <4, (2, 7, 9)>, <4, (5, 1, 9)>, 
<7, (1, 2, 4)>, <7, (1, 4, 9)>, <7, (2, 4, 9)>, <7, (4, 9, 5)>, <8, (1, 3, 9)>, 
<8, (2, 3, 9)>, <9, (0, 4, 5)>, <9, (1, 4, 7)>, <9, (1, 5, 9)>, <9, (2, 4, 7)>
