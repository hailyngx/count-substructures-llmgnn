Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph as an adjacency list:

Node 0: {1, 3, 5}
Node 1: {0, 3, 6, 9}
Node 2: {6}
Node 3: {0, 1, 5, 6, 9}
Node 4: {9}
Node 5: {0, 3, 7}
Node 6: {1, 2, 3, 7}
Node 7: {5, 6}
Node 9: {1, 3, 4}

Now, let's find the 3-stars:

Node 1 forms a 3-star with leaves {0, 3, 6}, so we have one 3-star: <1, (0, 3, 6)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1].
