Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 10 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 5) (5, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's create a table representing the neighbors of each node:

| Node | Neighbors   |
|------|-------------|
| 0    | 7           |
| 2    | 9           |
| 3    | 7           |
| 4    | 5           |
| 5    | 4           |
| 7    | 0, 3, 9     |
| 9    | 2, 7        |

Now, we can identify the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star. 
Node 9 has 2 neighbors and Node 0, 2, 3, 4, and 5 have only 1 neighbor each. Therefore, they cannot form any 3-stars. 

So, the total number of 3-stars is 1, which gives us the final answer:

[1]

And the unique 3-star found is:
<7, (0, 3, 9)>
