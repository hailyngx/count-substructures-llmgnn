Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1
- Node 1: 0, 2, 5, 6
- Node 2: 1, 5, 6
- Node 3: 7
- Node 5: 1, 2, 6, 7
- Node 6: 1, 2, 5, 7
- Node 7: 3, 5, 6, 8, 9
- Node 8: 7
- Node 9: 7

Next, we identify the nodes with three or more neighbors: Node 1, Node 5, Node 6, and Node 7.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each applicable node:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 22

Therefore, in this graph, there are a total of [22] 3-stars, which can be represented as <1, (0, 2, 5)>, <5, (1, 2, 6)>, and <7, (3, 5, 6)>.
