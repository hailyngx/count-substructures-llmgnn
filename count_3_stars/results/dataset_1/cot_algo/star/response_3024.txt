Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, we first need to determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {5, 6, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {3, 4}
- Node 2: Neighbors {3, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 2, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 2}
- Node 5: Neighbor {0}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 2, 3}
- Node 7: Neighbors {2, 3}
- Node 8: Neighbor {9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 3, 8}

Now, we will check each node that has three or more neighbors to see if they form 3-stars:

- Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
<0, (5, 6, 9)>

- Node 2: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
<2, (3, 4, 6)>, <2, (3, 6, 7)>, <2, (4, 6, 7)>, <2, (3, 6, 7)>

- Node 3: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
<3, (1, 2, 6)>, <3, (1, 2, 7)>, <3, (1, 6, 7)>, <3, (2, 6, 7)>, <3, (1, 6, 9)>,
<3, (2, 6, 9)>, <3, (7, 6, 9)>, <3, (3, 6, 7)>, <3, (3, 6, 9)>, <3, (3, 7, 9)>

- Node 9: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
<9, (0, 3, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 4 + 10 + 1] = [16].
