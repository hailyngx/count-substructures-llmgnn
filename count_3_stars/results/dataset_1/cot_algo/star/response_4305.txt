Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (3, 1) (4, 6) (5, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 5, 7, 8
- Node 1: 3
- Node 3: 1
- Node 4: 6
- Node 5: 0
- Node 6: 4
- Node 7: 0
- Node 8: 0, 9
- Node 9: 8

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

For Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For Node 8: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars (as it has less than 3 neighbors)

Total number of 3-stars: [1]

Therefore, the unique 3-star in this graph is <0, (5, 7, 8)>.
