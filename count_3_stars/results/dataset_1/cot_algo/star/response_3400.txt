Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
This graph has the following neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 3, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 1: {3, 5}
- Node 2: {0, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 5, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 8}
- Node 5: {1, 3, 8}
- Node 6: {0, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {9}
- Node 8: {4, 5, 6}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 3, 6, 7}

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 0, 5 neighbors: [inom{5}{3}] = 10, 3-stars: <0, (2, 4, 6)>, <0, (2, 6, 9)>, <0, (4, 6, 9)>, <0, (3, 6, 9)>, <0, (2, 4, 9)>, <0, (3, 4, 9)>, <0, (2, 3, 9)>, <0, (2, 4, 3)>, <0, (6, 3, 9)>, <0, (4, 3, 9)>

- Node 3, 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4, 3-stars: <3, (1, 5, 9)>, <3, (5, 9, 0)>, <3, (1, 9, 0)>, <3, (1, 5, 0)>

- Node 6, 3 neighbors: 1, 3-stars: <6, (0, 8, 9)>

- Node 8, 3 neighbors: 1, 3-stars: <8, (4, 5, 6)>

- Node 9, 5 neighbors: [inom{5}{3}] = 10, 3-stars: <9, (0, 2, 3)>, <9, (0, 3, 6)>, <9, (0, 6, 7)>, <9, (2, 3, 7)>, <9, (3, 7, 6)>, <9, (0, 2, 7)>, <9, (0, 2, 6)>, <9, (0, 7, 6)>, <9, (2, 7, 6)>, <9, (2, 3, 6)>

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get [10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10] = [26].

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 26, and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (2, 4, 6)>
- <0, (2, 6, 9)>
- <0, (4, 6, 9)>
- <0, (3, 6, 9)>
- <0, (2, 4, 9)>
- <0, (3, 4, 9)>
- <0, (2, 3, 9)>
- <0, (2, 4, 3)>
- <0, (6, 3, 9)>
- <0, (4, 3, 9)>
- <3, (1, 5, 9)>
- <3, (5, 9, 0)>
- <3, (1, 9, 0)>
- <3, (1, 5, 0)>
- <6, (0, 8, 9)>
- <8, (4, 5, 6)>
- <9, (0, 2, 3)>
- <9, (0, 3, 6)>
- <9, (0, 6, 7)>
- <9, (2, 3, 7)>
- <9, (3, 7, 6)>
- <9, (0, 2, 7)>
- <9, (0, 2, 6)>
- <9, (0, 7, 6)>
- <9, (2, 7, 6)>
- <9, (2, 3, 6)>
