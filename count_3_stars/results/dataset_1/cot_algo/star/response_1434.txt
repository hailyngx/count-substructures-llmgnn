Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 3, 4, 5
Node 1: 9
Node 2: 3, 5, 9
Node 3: 0, 2, 5, 8, 9
Node 4: 0, 7, 8
Node 5: 0, 2, 3
Node 6: 7, 8, 9
Node 7: 4, 6
Node 8: 3, 4, 6
Node 9: 1, 2, 3, 6

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

Node 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9 have three or more neighbors.

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of:

Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 19

Therefore, the final answer is [19], and the unique 3-stars are: <0, (3, 4, 5)>, <3, (0, 2, 5)>, <4, (0, 7, 8)>, <5, (0, 2, 3)>, <6, (7, 8, 9)>, <8, (3, 4, 6)>, <9, (1, 2, 3)>.
