Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's create the list of neighbors for each node:

- Node 1: 6, 7
- Node 2: 3, 5, 9
- Node 3: 2, 4, 5
- Node 4: 3, 5, 6
- Node 5: 2, 3, 4
- Node 6: 1, 4, 8
- Node 7: 1, 8
- Node 8: 6, 7
- Node 9: 2

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

So, the total number of 3-stars is 5, which we'll represent as [5].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <2, (3, 4, 5)>
- <3, (2, 4, 5)>
- <4, (2, 3, 5)>
- <5, (2, 3, 4)>
- <6, (1, 4, 8)>
