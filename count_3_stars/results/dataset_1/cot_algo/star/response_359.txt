Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: {2}  
Node 1: {2}  
Node 2: {0, 1, 3, 9}  
Node 3: {2, 4, 7}  
Node 4: {3}  
Node 5: {6, 7, 8}  
Node 6: {5, 8}  
Node 7: {3, 5}  
Node 8: {5, 6}  
Node 9: {2}

Now, we can identify the 3-stars:

Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.  
Node 3 has 3 neighbors: (2, 3, 4), (2, 3, 7), (3, 7, 5).  
Node 5 has 3 neighbors: (6, 7, 5), (5, 7, 3), (5, 6, 8).  

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get 4 + 3 + 3 = 10.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is [10], and the unique 3-stars are:  
<2, (0, 1, 3)>  
<2, (0, 1, 9)>  
<2, (0, 3, 9)>  
<2, (1, 3, 9)>  
<3, (2, 4, 7)>  
<5, (6, 7, 8)>  
<5, (6, 8, 5)>  
<5, (5, 7, 3)>
