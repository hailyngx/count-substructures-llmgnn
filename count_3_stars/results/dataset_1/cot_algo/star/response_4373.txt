Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The central nodes with three neighbors or more are: 
- Node 0 (neighbors 1, 3, 4, 8)
- Node 2 (neighbors 1, 3, 4, 8, 9)
- Node 8 (neighbors 0, 1, 2, 6, 9)
- Node 9 (neighbors 2, 4, 6, 8)

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 2 can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 8 can form 5 3-stars.
- Node 9 can form 3 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: [1 + 4 + 5 + 3] = [13]

Unique 3-stars:
- <0, (1, 3, 4)>
- <2, (1, 3, 4)>
- <2, (1, 4, 9)>
- <2, (3, 4, 9)>
- <8, (0, 1, 6)>
- <8, (0, 2, 6)>
- <8, (1, 2, 9)>
- <8, (6, 9, 4)>
- <9, (2, 4, 6)>
- <9, (2, 6, 8)>
- <9, (4, 6, 8)>
