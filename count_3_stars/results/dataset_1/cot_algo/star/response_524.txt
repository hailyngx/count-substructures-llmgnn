Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 4, 6, 8
- Node 1: 2, 3, 5
- Node 2: 1, 4
- Node 3: 1, 4, 5, 8
- Node 4: 0, 2, 3, 5
- Node 5: 1, 3, 4, 8
- Node 6: 0, 7, 8
- Node 7: 6, 8
- Node 8: 0, 3, 5, 6, 7

Nodes 0, 3, 5, and 8 have 4 or more neighbors, so we need to calculate the number of 3-stars they form.
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 19

Therefore, the final answer is [19] and the unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (4, 6, 8)>
- <3, (1, 4, 5)>
- <5, (1, 3, 4)>
- <8, (0, 3, 5)>
- <8, (0, 5, 6)>
- <8, (0, 5, 7)>
- <8, (3, 5, 6)>
- <8, (3, 5, 7)>
- <8, (6, 7, 8)>
- <8, (6, 7, 8)>
