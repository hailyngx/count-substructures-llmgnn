Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 8}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 5, 6}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 5, 8}
- Node 3: {1, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {7, 8}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 6, 8}
- Node 6: {1, 3, 5}
- Node 7: {4}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 3, 4, 5}
- Node 9: {3}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding these up:
\( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 26 \)

So, there are 26 total 3-stars in this graph, which can be listed as follows:
- <1, (2, 5, 6)>
- <2, (1, 5, 8)>
- <3, (1, 6, 8)>
- <5, (1, 2, 6)>
- <8, (1, 3, 4)>
