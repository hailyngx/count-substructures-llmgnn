Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 3) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 5, 9
- Node 1: 3, 4, 8
- Node 2: 7
- Node 3: 1, 4, 5, 6, 9
- Node 4: 1, 3, 8, 9
- Node 5: 0, 3
- Node 6: 3
- Node 7: 2
- Node 8: 1, 4
- Node 9: 0, 3, 4

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 0 and Node 9 have less than 3 neighbors, so they do not form any 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 4 = 15

So, the final answer is [15].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <3, (1, 4, 5)>
- <3, (1, 4, 6)>
- <3, (1, 4, 9)>
- <3, (1, 5, 6)>
- <3, (1, 5, 9)>
- <3, (1, 6, 9)>
- <3, (4, 5, 6)>
- <3, (4, 5, 9)>
- <3, (4, 6, 9)>
- <3, (5, 6, 9)>
- <4, (1, 3, 8)>
- <4, (1, 4, 8)>
- <4, (3, 4, 8)>
- <4, (1, 4, 9)>
- <9, (0, 3, 4)>
