Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 3 nodes in this graph with 3 or more neighbors: node 0, node 1, and node 4.

For Node 0:
Neighbors: 1, 4, 5, 6
Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
3-stars: <0, (1, 4, 5)>, <0, (1, 4, 6)>, <0, (4, 5, 6)>, <0, (1, 5, 6)>

For Node 1:
Neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 4
Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
3-stars: <1, (0, 2, 4)>, <1, (0, 3, 4)>, <1, (2, 3, 4)>, <1, (0, 2, 3)>

For Node 4:
Neighbors: 0, 1, 5, 6
Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
3-stars: <4, (0, 1, 5)>, <4, (0, 1, 6)>, <4, (5, 6, 0)>, <4, (1, 5, 6)>

The total number of 3-stars is [12].
