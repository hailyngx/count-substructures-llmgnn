Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 2, 4, 6
- Node 1: 2, 4, 5, 6
- Node 2: 0, 1, 4, 7
- Node 3: 6
- Node 4: 0, 1, 2, 5
- Node 5: 1, 4, 8
- Node 6: 0, 1, 3, 9
- Node 7: 2, 8
- Node 8: 5, 7
- Node 9: 6

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \( [1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4] = 17 \)

Unique 3-stars:
- <0, (2, 4, 6)>
- <1, (2, 4, 5)>
- <1, (4, 5, 6)>
- <1, (4, 5, 8)>
- <2, (0, 1, 4)>
- <2, (1, 4, 7)>
- <4, (0, 1, 5)>
- <4, (1, 2, 5)>
- <4, (1, 5, 8)>
- <4, (2, 5, 7)>
- <6, (0, 1, 3)>
- <6, (1, 3, 9)>
- <6, (3, 9, 0)>
- <6, (3, 9, 1)>
- <7, (2, 5, 8)>
- <8, (5, 7, 2)>
- <9, (3, 6, 0)>
