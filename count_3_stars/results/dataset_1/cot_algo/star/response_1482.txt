Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 3, 6
- Node 1: 4, 6, 7
- Node 2: 4, 9
- Node 3: 0, 9
- Node 4: 1, 2, 5
- Node 5: 4, 7, 8
- Node 6: 0, 1, 8
- Node 7: 1, 5
- Node 8: 5, 6
- Node 9: 2, 3

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1: 3 neighbors
- Node 4: 3 neighbors
- Node 5: 3 neighbors
- Node 6: 3 neighbors

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4, so we'll represent this as [4].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
1. <1, (4, 6, 7)>
2. <4, (1, 2, 5)>
3. <5, (4, 7, 8)>
4. <6, (0, 1, 8)>
