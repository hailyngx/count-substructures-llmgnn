Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 5, 7, 9
- Node 1: 0, 3, 8
- Node 2: 4, 8
- Node 3: 1, 4, 6
- Node 4: 0, 2, 3, 9
- Node 5: 0, 6, 7
- Node 6: 3, 5, 9
- Node 7: 0, 5
- Node 8: 1, 2
- Node 9: 0, 4, 6

Now we'll look at nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: Forms 1 3-star with neighbors (4, 5, 7)
- Node 4: Forms 1 3-star with neighbors (0, 2, 9)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2], and the unique 3-stars found are <0, (4, 5, 7)> and <4, (0, 2, 9)>.
