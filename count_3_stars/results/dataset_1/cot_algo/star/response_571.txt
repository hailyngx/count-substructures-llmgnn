Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: neighbors {4, 5}
- Node 1: neighbor {5}
- Node 2: neighbors {6, 7, 9}
- Node 3: neighbor {9}
- Node 4: neighbor {0}
- Node 5: neighbors {0, 1, 8}
- Node 6: neighbors {2, 7, 8}
- Node 7: neighbors {2, 6}
- Node 8: neighbors {5, 6}
- Node 9: neighbors {2, 3}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: 1 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

The total number of 3-stars is [2].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (4, 5, 8)>
<2, (6, 7, 9)>
