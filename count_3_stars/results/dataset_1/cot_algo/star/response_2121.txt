Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: 2, 4, 8
Node 1: 6, 7
Node 2: 0, 4, 5, 8, 9
Node 4: 0, 2, 7, 8
Node 5: 2, 7
Node 6: 1, 7, 8
Node 7: 1, 4, 5, 6
Node 8: 0, 2, 4, 6
Node 9: 2

Next, we will find the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we have a total of [23] 3-stars. 

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (2, 4, 8)>
<2, (0, 4, 5)>
<4, (0, 2, 7)>
<7, (1, 4, 5)>
