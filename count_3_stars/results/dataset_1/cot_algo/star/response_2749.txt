Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 4, 5, 8
- Node 1: 3, 7, 9
- Node 2: 4, 6
- Node 3: 1
- Node 4: 0, 2, 5, 6, 7, 9
- Node 5: 0, 4
- Node 6: 2, 4
- Node 7: 1, 4
- Node 8: 0
- Node 9: 1, 4

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors, so it forms inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars
- No other nodes have 3 or more neighbors to form a 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 20, which we will represent as [20].

The unique 3-star in this graph is <4, (0, 5, 6)>.
