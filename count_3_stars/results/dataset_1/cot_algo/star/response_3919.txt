Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: {3, 4}
Node 1: {2, 6, 7, 8}
Node 2: {1, 3, 5, 6}
Node 3: {0, 2, 4, 8, 9}
Node 4: {0, 3, 5, 6, 8}
Node 5: {2, 4, 7}
Node 6: {1, 2, 4, 8, 9}
Node 7: {1, 5, 9}
Node 8: {1, 3, 4, 6}
Node 9: {3, 6, 7}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

Node 1: inom(4, 3) = 4
Node 2: inom(4, 3) = 4
Node 3: inom(5, 3) = 10
Node 4: inom(5, 3) = 10
Node 6: inom(5, 3) = 10
Node 8: inom(4, 3) = 4
Node 9: inom(3, 3) = 1

Total number of 3-stars: [4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1] = 43

Unique 3-stars:
