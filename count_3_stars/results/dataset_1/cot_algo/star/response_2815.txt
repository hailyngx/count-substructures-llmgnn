Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: 2, 3, 4
- Node 1: 3, 4, 5
- Node 2: 0, 3, 4, 5, 6
- Node 3: 0, 1, 2
- Node 4: 0, 1, 2, 7, 8
- Node 5: 1, 2, 7
- Node 6: 2, 7, 8
- Node 7: 4, 5, 6, 8, 9
- Node 8: 4, 6, 7, 9
- Node 9: 7, 8

Next, let's identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:

- Node 0: not possible (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 1: not possible (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 2: <2, (0, 3, 4)>, <2, (0, 4, 5)>
- Node 3: <3, (0, 1, 2)>
- Node 4: <4, (0, 1, 2)>, <4, (7, 8, 9)>
- Node 5: not possible (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 6: not possible (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 7: <7, (4, 5, 6)>, <7, (8, 9, 4)>
- Node 8: <8, (4, 6, 7)>, <8, (7, 9, 4)>
- Node 9: not possible (less than 3 neighbors)

Counting the total number of 3-stars, we have 8 in total, so the final result is [8].
