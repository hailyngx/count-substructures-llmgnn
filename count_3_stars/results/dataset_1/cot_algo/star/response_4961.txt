Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 9) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {3, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {2, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbor {1}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 7, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbor {7}
- Node 7: Neighbors {3, 6, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 1, 3, 7}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars centered at each node:
- Node 0: inom{2}{3} = 0 3-stars
- Node 1: inom{2}{3} = 0 3-stars
- Node 2: 0 3-stars
- Node 3: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star <3, (0, 7, 9)>
- Node 6: 0 3-stars
- Node 7: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star <7, (3, 6, 9)>
- Node 9: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star <9, (0, 1, 3)>

Total number of 3-stars: 3 ([])

Unique 3-stars:
- <3, (0, 7, 9)>
- <7, (3, 6, 9)>
- <9, (0, 1, 3)>
