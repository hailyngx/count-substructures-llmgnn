Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 5) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The neighbor sets for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: {7, 8}
- Node 1: {6}
- Node 2: {4, 5, 6}
- Node 3: {5}
- Node 4: {2}
- Node 5: {2, 3, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 7}
- Node 7: {0, 6}
- Node 8: {0, 5, 9}
- Node 9: {5, 8}

Now, let's check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they form:
- Node 0 and Node 8 each have exactly 2 neighbors, so they do not form any 3-stars.
- Node 2 and Node 5 each have 4 neighbors, so they can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars in the graph: \( [4 + 1] = 5 \)

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<2, (4, 5, 6)>
<5, (2, 8, 9)>
<6, (1, 2, 7)>
<6, (2, 7, 8)>
<6, (5, 7, 8)>
