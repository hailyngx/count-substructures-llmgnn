Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 2
- Node 1: 2, 4, 8, 9
- Node 2: 0, 1, 7
- Node 4: 1, 6, 8
- Node 5: 7, 8
- Node 6: 4, 9
- Node 7: 2, 5
- Node 8: 1, 4, 5
- Node 9: 1, 6

Next, we'll find the 3-stars:

- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. The 3-stars are:
  <1, (2, 4, 8)>, <1, (2, 4, 9)>, <1, (2, 8, 9)>, <1, (4, 8, 9)>

- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star: <2, (0, 1, 7)>

- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star: <4, (1, 6, 8)>

- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star: <8, (1, 4, 5)>

In total, there are 7 3-stars in this graph, so the final number inside brackets is [7].
