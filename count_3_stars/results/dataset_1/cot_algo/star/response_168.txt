Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 5, 7, 8
- Node 1: 3
- Node 2: 5, 6
- Node 3: 1, 4, 9
- Node 4: 3, 7
- Node 5: 0, 2, 9
- Node 6: 2, 7, 8
- Node 7: 0, 4, 6, 8
- Node 8: 0, 6, 7, 9
- Node 9: 3, 5, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 2, Node 3, Node 4, Node 5, Node 6, Node 7, Node 8, Node 9

Calculating \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: \( 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 13 \)

Therefore, the final count of 3-stars is [13], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (5, 7, 8)>, <3, (1, 4, 9)>, <5, (0, 2, 9)>, <6, (2, 7, 8)>, <7, (0, 4, 6)>, <7, (0, 6, 8)>, <7, (4, 6, 8)>, <7, (6, 8, 9)>, <8, (0, 6, 7)>, <8, (0, 7, 9)>, <8, (6, 7, 9)>, <8, (7, 9, 9)>,<9, (3, 5, 8)>
