Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph with 10 nodes and 28 edges, we first need to determine the neighbors for each node:

Node 0 neighbors: 8, 9
Node 1 neighbors: 2, 6, 7, 8
Node 2 neighbors: 1, 5, 6
Node 3 neighbors: 4, 7
Node 4 neighbors: 3, 6
Node 5 neighbors: 2, 9
Node 6 neighbors: 1, 2, 4
Node 7 neighbors: 1, 3, 9
Node 8 neighbors: 0, 1, 9
Node 9 neighbors: 0, 5, 7, 8

Now, we can identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each:

Node 1: <1, (2, 6, 8)>, <1, (7, 8, 9)>
Node 2: <2, (1, 5, 6)>
Node 6: <6, (1, 2, 4)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4] and the unique 3-stars formed are <1, (2, 6, 8)>, <1, (7, 8, 9)>, <2, (1, 5, 6)>, and <6, (1, 2, 4)>.
