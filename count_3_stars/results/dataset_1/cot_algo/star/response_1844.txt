Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (2, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
Given the graph information, let's determine the 3-stars present.

- Node 0 has neighbors: {4, 5, 6}, forming 3 3-stars: <0, (4, 5, 6)>, <0, (4, 5, 6)>, <0, (4, 5, 6)>
- Node 1 has neighbors: {4}, which is less than 3, so no 3-stars are formed.
- Node 2 has neighbors: {7}, which is less than 3, so no 3-stars are formed.
- Node 4 has neighbors: {0, 1, 8}, forming 1 3-star: <4, (0, 1, 8)>
- Node 5 has neighbors: {0, 6, 7, 9}, forming inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars: <5, (0, 6, 7)>, <5, (0, 6, 9)>, <5, (6, 7, 9)>, <5, (0, 7, 9)>
- Node 6 has neighbors: {0, 5, 8}, forming inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star: <6, (0, 5, 8)>
- Node 7 has neighbors: {2, 5}, which is less than 3, so no 3-stars are formed.
- Node 8 has neighbors: {4, 6}, which is less than 3, so no 3-stars are formed.
- Node 9 has neighbors: {5}, which is less than 3, so no 3-stars are formed.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3 + 1 + 4 + 1] = 9, and the unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (4, 5, 6)>, <4, (0, 1, 8)>, <5, (0, 6, 7)>, <5, (0, 6, 9)>, <5, (6, 7, 9)>, <5, (0, 7, 9)>, <6, (0, 5, 8)>
