Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list out the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 8
- Node 1: 5, 6
- Node 2: 4, 6
- Node 3: 7
- Node 4: 2, 5
- Node 5: 1, 4, 9
- Node 6: 1, 2, 8
- Node 7: 3
- Node 8: 0, 6
- Node 9: 5

Next, we'll identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1, Node 2, Node 5, Node 6, and Node 8 have three or more neighbors.

For each of these nodes, we calculate the number of 3-stars they are a part of:
- For Node 1, there is 1 3-star: <1, (5, 6)>
- For Node 2, there is 1 3-star: <2, (4, 6)>
- For Node 5, there is 1 3-star: <5, (1, 4, 9)>
- For Node 6, there is 1 3-star: <6, (1, 2, 8)>
- For Node 8, there is 1 3-star: <8, (0, 6)|>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 5, which we represent as [5].
