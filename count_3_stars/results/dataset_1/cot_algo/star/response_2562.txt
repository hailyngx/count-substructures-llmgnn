Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 3, 9
- Node 1: 2, 3, 4, 6, 8
- Node 2: 1, 3, 8
- Node 3: 0, 1, 2, 5
- Node 4: 1, 8, 9
- Node 5: 3, 9
- Node 6: 1, 7
- Node 7: 6
- Node 8: 1, 2, 4, 9
- Node 9: 0, 4, 5, 8

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1, 3, 8, and 9 have 5 neighbors each.

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 22 \)

So, the final answer is [22] and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (2, 4, 8)>
- <1, (2, 4, 9)>
- <1, (3, 6, 8)>
- <1, (3, 6, 9)>
- <1, (4, 8, 9)>
- <3, (0, 2, 5)>
- <3, (1, 2, 5)>
- <3, (4, 8, 9)>
- <8, (1, 4, 9)>
- <9, (0, 4, 5)>
