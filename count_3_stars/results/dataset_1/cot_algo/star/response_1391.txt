Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph as an adjacency list to better understand the connections:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 6
- Node 1: 0, 7
- Node 2: 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 3: 2, 5, 8
- Node 4: 0, 2, 6, 7
- Node 5: 3, 7
- Node 6: 0, 2, 4, 7
- Node 7: 1, 2, 4, 5, 6
- Node 8: 2, 3
- Node 9: 2

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: (1, 4, 6) -> Total 3-stars: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 <0, (1, 4, 6)>
- Node 2 has 6 neighbors: (3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9) -> Total 3-stars: [inom{6}{3}] = 20 <2, (3, 4, 7)>, <2, (3, 4, 6)>, <2, (3, 6, 7)>, <2, (4, 6, 7)>, <2, (4, 6, 7)>, <2, (6, 7, 8)>
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: (2, 5, 8) -> Total 3-stars: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 <3, (2, 5, 8)>
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: (0, 2, 6, 7) -> Total 3-stars: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 <4, (0, 2, 6)>, <4, (0, 2, 7)>, <4, (0, 6, 7)>, <4, (2, 6, 7)>
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: (0, 2, 4, 7) -> Total 3-stars: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 <6, (0, 2, 4)>, <6, (0, 2, 7)>, <6, (0, 4, 7)>, <6, (2, 4, 7)>
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors: (1, 2, 4, 5, 6) -> Total 3-stars: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 <7, (1, 2, 5)>, <7, (1, 2, 6)>, <7, (1, 5, 6)>, <7, (2, 4, 5)>, <7, (2, 4, 6)>, <7, (2, 5, 6)>, <7, (4, 5, 6)>
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors: (2, 3) - Less than 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 1 neighbor: (2) - Less than 3 neighbors

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: [1 + 20 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10] = 40  

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is 40.
