Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 2, 9
- Node 1: 2, 9
- Node 2: 0, 1, 3, 7, 8, 9
- Node 3: 2, 5, 6
- Node 4: 5
- Node 5: 3, 4, 6, 9
- Node 6: 3, 5
- Node 7: 2, 8, 9
- Node 8: 2, 7
- Node 9: 0, 1, 2, 5, 7

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, and 9: <2, (1, 3, 9)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 4, and 6: <5, (3, 4, 6)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 2, and 7: <9, (1, 2, 7)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is 3, and the unique 3-stars found are <2, (1, 3, 9)>, <5, (3, 4, 6)>, and <9, (1, 2, 7)> giving us a final answer of [3].
