Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 2, 4, 5
- Node 1: 7, 8
- Node 2: 0, 3, 9
- Node 3: 2, 8, 9
- Node 4: 0, 8
- Node 5: 0, 6
- Node 6: 5, 9
- Node 7: 1
- Node 8: 1, 3, 4
- Node 9: 2, 3, 6

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding these up gives a total of 5 3-stars in the graph: [5]

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <0, (2, 5, 4)>, <2, (0, 3, 9)>, <3, (2, 8, 9)>, <8, (1, 4, 3)>, <9, (2, 3, 6)>
