Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 4, 7
- Node 1: 0, 2, 5, 6
- Node 2: 0, 1, 4, 6, 9
- Node 4: 0, 2, 6
- Node 5: 1, 6, 8
- Node 6: 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9
- Node 7: 0
- Node 8: 5, 6
- Node 9: 2, 6

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)

Summing these up: 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 20 + 0 + 0 = 40
Therefore, there are a total of 40 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<1, (0, 2, 5)>
<1, (0, 2, 6)>
<2, (0, 1, 4)>
<2, (1, 4, 6)>
<2, (4, 6, 9)>
<4, (0, 2, 6)>
<6, (1, 2, 4)>
<6, (1, 4, 5)>
<6, (1, 5, 8)>
<6, (2, 4, 6)>
<6, (4, 5, 8)>
<6, (5, 8, 6)>
<6, (6, 8, 9)>
