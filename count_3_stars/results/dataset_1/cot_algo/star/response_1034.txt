Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {3, 4, 7}
- Node 2: {5, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 6}
- Node 5: {2, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {2, 4, 5}
- Node 7: {0, 2}
- Node 8: {2, 5}
- Node 9: {3, 5}

Next, let's find the number of 3-stars formed by each node:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing up the 3-stars from each node: 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 10, so the final result is [10].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (3, 4, 7)>
- <2, (5, 6, 7)>
- <2, (5, 6, 8)>
- <2, (6, 4, 5)>
- <2, (6, 5, 8)>
- <5, (2, 6, 8)>
- <5, (6, 4, 2)>
- <5, (6, 2, 8)>
- <5, (6, 8, 9)>
- <6, (2, 4, 5)>
