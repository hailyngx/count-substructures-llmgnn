Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 1: {4}
- Node 2: {4, 9}
- Node 3: {4, 6}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 3, 9}
- Node 5: {6, 7}
- Node 6: {3, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 7: {5, 6, 8}
- Node 8: {7, 9}
- Node 9: {2, 4, 6, 8}

Now, we can identify the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 2 forms a 3-star: <2, (4, 9, 6)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star: <4, (1, 2, 3)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star: <6, (3, 5, 7)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star: <9, (2, 4, 8)>

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4].
