Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 6
- Node 1: 4, 7
- Node 2: 0
- Node 3: 0, 9
- Node 4: 1, 8
- Node 5: 7, 9
- Node 6: 0
- Node 7: 1, 5, 8, 9
- Node 8: 4, 7, 9
- Node 9: 3, 5, 7, 8

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <0, (2, 3, 6)>
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <7, (1, 5, 8)>, <7, (1, 8, 9)>, <7, (5, 8, 9)>, <7, (1, 5, 9)>
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <9, (3, 5, 7)>, <9, (3, 7, 8)>, <9, (5, 7, 8)>, <9, (3, 5, 8)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is 1 + 4 + 4 = 9, which we represent as [9].
The unique 3-stars found are <0, (2, 3, 6)>, <7, (1, 5, 8)>, <7, (1, 8, 9)>, <7, (5, 8, 9)>, <7, (1, 5, 9)>, <9, (3, 5, 7)>, <9, (3, 7, 8)>, <9, (5, 7, 8)>, <9, (3, 5, 8)>.
