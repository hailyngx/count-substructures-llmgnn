Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) 

Response:
The neighbors for each node are:
- Node 0: 5, 6, 7, 8
- Node 1: 5
- Node 2: 9
- Node 4: 6, 7, 8
- Node 5: 0, 1
- Node 6: 0, 4, 8
- Node 7: 0, 4
- Node 8: 0, 4, 6
- Node 9: 2

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = [4 + 1 + 1] = 6

The unique 3-stars are:
1. <0, (5, 6, 7)>
2. <0, (5, 6, 8)>
3. <0, (5, 7, 8)>
4. <0, (6, 7, 8)>
5. <4, (6, 7, 8)>
6. <8, (4, 6, 7)>
