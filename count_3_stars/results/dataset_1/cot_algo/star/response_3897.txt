Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9
- Node 1: 4
- Node 2: 0, 4, 8, 9
- Node 3: 9
- Node 4: 0, 1, 2, 5, 7
- Node 5: 0, 4, 7
- Node 6: 7, 8, 9
- Node 7: 0, 4, 5, 6
- Node 8: 0, 2, 6
- Node 9: 0, 2, 3, 6

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars involving these nodes:

- Node 0: 3-stars = \[ \binom{6}{3} = 20 \] = <0, (2, 7, 8)>, <0, (2, 7, 9)>, <0, (2, 8, 9)>, <0, (7, 8, 9)>
- Node 2: 3-stars = \[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \] = <2, (0, 8, 9)>
- Node 4: 3-stars = \[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \] = <4, (0, 5, 7)>, <4, (0, 5, 2)>, <4, (0, 7, 2)>, <4, (5, 7, 2)>, <4, (5, 7, 6)>
- Node 6: 3-stars = \[ \binom{3}{3} = 1 \] = <6, (7, 8, 9)>
- Node 7: 3-stars = \[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \] = <7, (0, 5, 4)>, <7, (0, 5, 6)>, <7, (4, 5, 6)>
- Node 8: 3-stars = \[ \binom{3}{3} = 1 \] = <8, (0, 6, 2)>
- Node 9: 3-stars = \[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \] = <9, (0, 2, 6)>, <9, (0, 2, 3)>, <9, (0, 6, 3)>, <9, (2, 6, 3)>

Total number of 3-stars: \[ 20 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 44 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [44] and the unique 3-stars found are <0, (2, 7, 8)>, <0, (2, 7, 9)>, <0, (2, 8, 9)>, <0, (7, 8, 9)>, <2, (0, 8, 9)>, <4, (0, 5, 7)>, <4, (0, 5, 2)>, <4, (0, 7, 2)>, <4, (5, 7, 2)>, <4, (5, 7, 6)>, <6, (7, 8, 9)>, <7, (0, 5, 4)>, <7, (0, 5, 6)>, <7, (4, 5, 6)>, <8, (0, 6, 2)>, <9, (0, 2, 6)>, <9, (0, 2, 3)>, <9, (0, 6, 3)>, <9, (2, 6, 3)>
