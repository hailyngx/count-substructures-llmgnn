Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {7, 8}
- Node 1: {2, 4}
- Node 2: {1, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 3: {5, 6}
- Node 4: {1, 6}
- Node 5: {3, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {2, 3, 4}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 7}
- Node 9: {5, 7}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 2: <2, (1, 7, 8)>
- Node 5: <5, (3, 7, 9)>
- Node 7: <7, (0, 8, 9)>, <7, (2, 5, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [5].
The unique 3-stars are <2, (1, 7, 8)>, <5, (3, 7, 9)>, <7, (0, 8, 9)>, <7, (2, 5, 8)>.
