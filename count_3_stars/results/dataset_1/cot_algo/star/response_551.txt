Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 7}
- Node 1: {2, 4, 7}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 4, 5}
- Node 3: {6}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 5: {2, 4, 6}
- Node 6: {3, 5, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 4, 8}
- Node 8: {7}
- Node 9: {4, 6}

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors {2, 4, 7}. So, there is one 3-star.
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with neighbors {1, 4, 5}. So, there is one 3-star.
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with neighbors {1, 2, 5} and another one with {7, 9, 6}. So, there are two 3-stars.
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with neighbors {2, 4, 6}. So, there is one 3-star.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: [1 + 1 + 2 + 1] = [5]

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in this graph are: <1, (2, 4, 7)>, <2, (1, 4, 5)>, <4, (1, 2, 5)>, <4, (6, 7, 9)>, and <5, (2, 4, 6)>.
