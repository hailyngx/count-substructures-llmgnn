Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) 

Response:
The neighbor set for each node is as follows:

Node 0: {1, 2, 4, 7, 8}
Node 1: {0, 2, 4}
Node 2: {0, 1}
Node 3: {4}
Node 4: {0, 1, 3, 6, 7}
Node 6: {4, 7}
Node 7: {0, 4, 6}
Node 8: {0}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:

Node 0 has \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 1 has \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
Node 4 has \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 7 has \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

Adding these up: 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 22, so there are a total of 22 3-stars in this graph. 

Therefore, the final answer is [22] and the unique 3-stars found are <0, (1, 2, 4)>, <0, (1, 4, 7)>, <0, (2, 4, 7)>, <0, (4, 6, 7)>.
