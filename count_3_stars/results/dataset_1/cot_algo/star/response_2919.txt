Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {3, 4, 5}
- Node 1: {3, 4}
- Node 2: {3, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 2, 4, 6}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 3, 8}
- Node 5: {0, 7}
- Node 6: {3, 8}
- Node 7: {5, 8}
- Node 8: {2, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 9: {2}

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, which is more than 3, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, which is more than 3, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, which is more than 3, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 10 + 4 + 4 = 18, which can be represented as [18].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <3, (0, 1, 2)>
- <3, (0, 1, 4)>
- <3, (0, 1, 6)>
- <3, (0, 2, 4)>
- <3, (0, 2, 8)>
- <3, (0, 4, 6)>
- <3, (1, 2, 6)>
- <3, (1, 3, 6)>
- <3, (2, 4, 8)>
- <4, (0, 1, 8)>
- <4, (0, 3, 8)>
- <4, (1, 2, 8)>
- <8, (2, 4, 6)>
- <8, (2, 4, 7)>
- <8, (2, 6, 7)>
- <8, (4, 6, 7)>
- <3, (0, 6, 8)>
- <4, (1, 6, 8)>
