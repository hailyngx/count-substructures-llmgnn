Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 7, 9
- Node 1: 0
- Node 2: 4, 8
- Node 3: 4, 5
- Node 4: 0, 2, 3, 6, 7
- Node 5: 3, 7, 8, 9
- Node 6: 4, 8
- Node 7: 0, 4, 5, 9
- Node 8: 2, 5, 6, 9
- Node 9: 0, 5, 7, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
Node 0 forms a 3-star with neighbors 1, 4, 7: <0, (1, 4, 7)>
Node 4 forms a 3-star with neighbors 0, 7, 2: <4, (0, 7, 2)>
Node 5 forms a 3-star with neighbors 3, 7, 8: <5, (3, 7, 8)>
Node 8 forms a 3-star with neighbors 2, 9, 5: <8, (2, 9, 5)>
Node 9 forms a 3-star with neighbors 0, 7, 8: <9, (0, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 5, so the answer is [5].
