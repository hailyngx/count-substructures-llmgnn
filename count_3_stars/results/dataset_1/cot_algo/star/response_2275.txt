Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
Node 0: 9
Node 1: 3, 9
Node 2: 3, 6, 8, 9
Node 3: 1, 2, 5
Node 4: 9
Node 5: 3, 9
Node 6: 2, 8
Node 8: 2, 6
Node 9: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:
- Node 2, with 4 neighbors
- Node 9, with 5 neighbors

For Node 2:
\( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars can be formed.
The unique 3-stars involving Node 2 are: <2, (3, 6, 8)>, <2, (3, 6, 9)>, <2, (3, 8, 9)>, <2, (6, 8, 9)>

For Node 9:
\( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars can be formed.
The unique 3-stars involving Node 9 are: <9, (0, 1, 2)>, <9, (0, 1, 4)>, <9, (0, 1, 5)>, <9, (0, 2, 4)>, <9, (0, 2, 5)>, <9, (0, 4, 5)>, <9, (1, 2, 4)>, <9, (1, 2, 5)>, <9, (1, 4, 5)>, <9, (2, 4, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [4 + 10] = 14.
The unique 3-stars found are: <2, (3, 6, 8)>, <2, (3, 6, 9)>, <2, (3, 8, 9)>, <2, (6, 8, 9)>, <9, (0, 1, 2)>, <9, (0, 1, 4)>, <9, (0, 1, 5)>, <9, (0, 2, 4)>, <9, (0, 2, 5)>, <9, (0, 4, 5)>, <9, (1, 2, 4)>, <9, (1, 2, 5)>, <9, (1, 4, 5)>, <9, (2, 4, 5)>
