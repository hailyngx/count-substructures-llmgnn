Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: {2, 3, 5, 8}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 5, 8}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 3}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 2, 4, 8}
- Node 4: {3, 6}
- Node 5: {0, 1}
- Node 6: {4, 7}
- Node 7: {6}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 3}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

- Node 0: 4 choose 3 = 4
- Node 1: 4 choose 3 = 4
- Node 3: 5 choose 3 = 10
- Node 8: 3 choose 3 = 1

Adding these up: 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 19

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [19].

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (2, 3, 5)>
<0, (2, 3, 8)>
<0, (2, 5, 8)>
<1, (2, 3, 5)>
<1, (2, 3, 8)>
<1, (2, 5, 8)>
<3, (0, 1, 8)>
<3, (0, 2, 8)>
<3, (1, 2, 8)>
<3, (2, 4, 8)>
<8, (0, 1, 3)>
