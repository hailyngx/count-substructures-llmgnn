Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The neighbor sets for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: {4, 8}
- Node 1: {2, 6, 7}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 6}
- Node 3: {2, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 5}
- Node 5: {4}
- Node 6: {1, 2}
- Node 7: {1, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 3, 9}
- Node 9: {7, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms a 3-star: <1, (2, 6, 7)>
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it forms a 3-star: <2, (1, 3, 6)>
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it forms a 3-star: <8, (0, 3, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [3].
