Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {3}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 2: {1}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {1}
- Node 5: {6, 8}
- Node 6: {1, 5}
- Node 7: {1, 3, 8}
- Node 8: {3, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 4, and 6: <1, (2, 4, 6)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 8, and 0: <3, (7, 8, 0)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 8, and 8: <5, (6, 8, 8)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 7, and 9: <8, (5, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4] and the unique 3-stars are <1, (2, 4, 6)>, <3, (7, 8, 0)>, <5, (6, 8, 8)>, and <8, (5, 7, 9)>.
