Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The graph has the following neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {4, 6, 7}
- Node 1: {8}
- Node 2: {4}
- Node 3: {4, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 3, 5, 6}
- Node 5: {4, 7}
- Node 6: {0, 3, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {0, 3, 5, 6}
- Node 8: {1, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {3, 8}

Now, we will identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with leaves {4, 6, 7} <0, (4, 6, 7)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with leaves {4, 6, 7} <3, (4, 6, 7)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with leaves {0, 3, 6} <4, (0, 3, 6)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with leaves {0, 3, 7} <6, (0, 3, 7)>

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4]. The unique 3-stars found are <0, (4, 6, 7)>, <3, (4, 6, 7)>, <4, (0, 3, 6)>, <6, (0, 3, 7)>.
