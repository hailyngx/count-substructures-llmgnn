Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {4, 7, 8}
- Node 1: {3, 4, 9}
- Node 2: {4, 5, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 5: {2, 4, 6}
- Node 6: {2, 4, 5}
- Node 7: {0, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 3, 4}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 7}

Next, let's identify the nodes that have at least 3 neighbors:
- Node 0, 2, 4, and 8 have 3 or more neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star can be formed
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars can be formed
- Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars can be formed
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars can be formed

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 20 + 4 = 35

Therefore, the final answer is [35] and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (4, 7, 8)>
- <2, (4, 5, 6)>
- <4, (0, 1, 2)>
- <8, (0, 2, 3)>
