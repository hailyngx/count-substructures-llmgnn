Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
The neighbors for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 5, 6, 8, 9
- Node 1: 0, 5, 8, 9
- Node 2: 4, 7
- Node 3: 4
- Node 4: 2, 3
- Node 5: 0, 1, 8, 9
- Node 6: 0, 8
- Node 7: 2
- Node 8: 0, 1, 5, 6
- Node 9: 0, 1, 5

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 5, and 8: <0, (1, 5, 8)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 5, and 8: <1, (0, 5, 8)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, and 8: <5, (0, 1, 8)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, and 5: <8, (0, 1, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4].
