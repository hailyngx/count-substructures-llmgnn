Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's create the neighbor sets for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {2}
- Node 1: {6, 8}
- Node 2: {0}
- Node 4: {6, 7}
- Node 5: {8}
- Node 6: {1, 4, 9}
- Node 7: {4}
- Node 8: {1, 5}
- Node 9: {6}

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 1: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (1 unique 3-star: <6, (1, 4, 9)>)

Now, let's put the final number inside the brackets:
Total number of 3-stars: [1]

List of unique 3-stars: <6, (1, 4, 9)>
