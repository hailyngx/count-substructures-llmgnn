Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 1: {3, 6, 7}
- Node 2: {3, 4, 7}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 5, 6}
- Node 4: {2, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 5: {3, 4, 8}
- Node 6: {1, 3, 8}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 4, 8}
- Node 8: {5, 6, 7}
- Node 9: {4}

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars:
From the above list, nodes 1, 2, 4, and 7 have 3 or more neighbors, so we will calculate inom{n}{3} for each of these nodes:
- Node 1: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 2: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 7: inom{4}{3} = 4

Summing these up, we get a total of [1 + 1 + 4 + 4] = [10].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
- 3-stars with Node 1: <1, (3, 6, 7)>
- 3-stars with Node 2: <2, (3, 4, 7)>
- 3-stars with Node 4: <4, (2, 5, 7)>, <4, (5, 7, 9)>, <4, (2, 7, 9)>, <4, (2, 5, 9)>
- 3-stars with Node 7: <7, (1, 4, 8)>, <7, (2, 4, 8)>, <7, (4, 8, 2)>, <7, (1, 2, 8)>

So, the total number of 3-stars is [10] and the unique 3-stars are <1, (3, 6, 7)>, <2, (3, 4, 7)>, <4, (2, 5, 7)>, <4, (5, 7, 9)>, <4, (2, 7, 9)>, <4, (2, 5, 9)>, <7, (1, 4, 8)>, <7, (2, 4, 8)>, <7, (4, 8, 2)>, <7, (1, 2, 8)>.
