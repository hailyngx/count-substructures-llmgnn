Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: 5, 7, 8
Node 1: 2, 4, 5, 7
Node 2: 1, 5, 7
Node 3: 6, 7
Node 4: 1
Node 5: 0, 1, 2, 6, 7, 9
Node 6: 3, 5, 7, 8, 9
Node 7: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6
Node 8: 0, 6
Node 9: 5, 6

Now, we'll determine the number of 3-stars formed by each node:

Node 0: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
Node 1: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 2: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
Node 3: 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
Node 4: 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
Node 5: [inom{6}{3}] = 20
Node 6: [inom{5}{3}] = 10  
Node 7: [inom{6}{3}] = 20
Node 8: 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
Node 9: 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)

Total number of 3-stars: [1 + 4 + 1 + 20 + 10 + 20] = [56]

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (5, 7, 8)>
<1, (2, 4, 5)>
<2, (1, 5, 7)>
<5, (0, 1, 6)>
<6, (3, 5, 7)>
<7, (0, 1, 5)>
