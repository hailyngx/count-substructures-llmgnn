Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 4, 7
- Node 1: 0, 4, 8
- Node 2: 0, 5
- Node 3: 5, 6
- Node 4: 0, 1, 5, 7
- Node 5: 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 6: 3, 5, 9
- Node 7: 0, 4
- Node 8: 1, 5
- Node 9: 5, 6

Now, we can identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <0, (1, 2, 4)>, <0, (1, 2, 7)>, <0, (1, 4, 7)>, <0, (2, 4, 7)>
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <1, (0, 4, 8)>
- Node 5 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars. However, we need to exclude the 3-stars we've already counted when considering other nodes. So, the unique ones are: 
  - <5, (2, 3, 4)>
  - <5, (2, 3, 6)>
  - <5, (2, 3, 9)>
  - <5, (2, 4, 6)>
  - <5, (2, 4, 9)>
  - <5, (2, 6, 9)>
  - <5, (3, 4, 6)>
  - <5, (3, 4, 9)>
  - <5, (3, 8, 9)>
  - <5, (4, 6, 9)>
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <6, (3, 5, 9)>

Counting unique 3-stars, we get a total of [4 + 1 + 9 + 1] = [15].
