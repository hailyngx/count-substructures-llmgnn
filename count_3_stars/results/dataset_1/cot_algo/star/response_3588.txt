Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 4, 5}
- Node 1: {3, 6, 8}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 5}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 4}
- Node 4: {0, 3, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 2}
- Node 6: {1, 4}
- Node 7: {4, 9}
- Node 8: {1, 9}
- Node 9: {4, 7, 8}

Now, let's identify nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 4, and Node 9 have 3 or more neighbors.

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 1 = 12

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [12], and the unique 3-stars found are <0, (2, 4, 5)>, <4, (0, 3, 6)>, <9, (7, 8, 4)>.
