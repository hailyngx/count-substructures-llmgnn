Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 4, 6
- Node 1: 2, 5, 6
- Node 2: 0, 1
- Node 3: 5, 7, 9
- Node 4: 0, 6
- Node 5: 1, 3
- Node 6: 0, 1, 4, 9
- Node 7: 3, 8
- Node 8: 7
- Node 9: 3, 6

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 4 = 6

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [6], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<1, (2, 5, 6)>
<6, (0, 1, 4)>
<6, (0, 1, 9)>
<6, (1, 4, 9)>
<6, (0, 4, 9)>
