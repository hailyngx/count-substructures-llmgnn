Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list out the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: 1, 4, 6
Node 1: 0, 4, 5, 6, 8
Node 2: 3, 7
Node 3: 2, 5, 6, 8
Node 4: 0, 1, 7, 9
Node 5: 1, 3, 6, 9
Node 6: 0, 1, 3, 5
Node 7: 2, 4
Node 8: 1, 3
Node 9: 4, 5

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes (1, 4, 6)
Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes (4, 5, 6)
Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes (5, 6, 8)
Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes (1, 7, 9)

So, there are a total of [4] 3-stars in the graph, and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 4, 6)>, <1, (4, 5, 6)>, <3, (5, 6, 8)>, <4, (1, 7, 9)>
