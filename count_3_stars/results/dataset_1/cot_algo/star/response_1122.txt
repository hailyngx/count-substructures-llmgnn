Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: neighbors {1, 2, 7}
- Node 1: neighbors {0, 2, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 2: neighbors {0, 1, 4, 9}
- Node 3: neighbors {4, 5}
- Node 4: neighbors {1, 2, 3}
- Node 5: neighbors {3, 9}
- Node 6: neighbors {1, 7}
- Node 7: neighbors {0, 6}
- Node 9: neighbors {1, 2, 5}

Now, let's find the 3-star configurations:

For Node 1: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) possible 3-stars
    - <1, (0, 2, 6)>
    - <1, (0, 2, 9)>
    - <1, (0, 4, 6)>
    - <1, (0, 4, 9)>
    - <1, (2, 4, 6)>
    - <1, (2, 4, 9)>
    - <1, (0, 6, 9)>
    - <1, (2, 6, 9)>
    - <1, (4, 6, 9)>
    - <1, (0, 2, 4)>

For Node 2: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) possible 3-stars
    - <2, (0, 1, 9)>
    - <2, (0, 4, 9)>
    - <2, (1, 4, 9)>
    - <2, (0, 1, 4)>

For Node 9: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) possible 3-stars
    - <9, (1, 2, 5)>
    - <9, (1, 3, 5)>
    - <9, (2, 3, 5)>
    - <9, (1, 2, 3)>

The total number of 3-stars is \(10 + 4 + 4 = 18\) which can be expressed as [18]. 

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (0, 2, 6)>, <1, (0, 2, 9)>, <1, (0, 4, 6)>, <1, (0, 4, 9)>, <1, (2, 4, 6)>, <1, (2, 4, 9)>, 
<1, (0, 6, 9)>, <1, (2, 6, 9)>, <1, (4, 6, 9)>, <1, (0, 2, 4)>, 
<2, (0, 1, 9)>, <2, (0, 4, 9)>, <2, (1, 4, 9)>, <2, (0, 1, 4)>, 
<9, (1, 2, 5)>, <9, (1, 3, 5)>, <9, (2, 3, 5)>, <9, (1, 2, 3)>
