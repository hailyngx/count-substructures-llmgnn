Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Based on the given information, let's first find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 2, 7}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 3, 6, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 3, 5, 7}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 2, 8}
- Node 5: Neighbors {2, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 5}
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 2, 5, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {3, 5, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {1, 7, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms one 3-star: <0, (1, 2, 7)>
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it forms four 3-stars: 
  <1, (0, 3, 6)>
  <1, (0, 3, 9)>
  <1, (0, 6, 9)>
  <1, (3, 6, 9)>
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it forms four 3-stars:
  <2, (0, 3, 5)>
  <2, (0, 3, 7)>
  <2, (0, 5, 7)>
  <2, (3, 5, 7)>
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms one 3-star: <3, (1, 2, 8)>
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it forms four 3-stars:
  <5, (2, 6, 7)>
  <5, (2, 6, 8)>
  <5, (2, 7, 8)>
  <5, (6, 7, 8)>
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it forms four 3-stars:
  <7, (0, 5, 9)>
  <7, (2, 5, 9)>
  <7, (2, 7, 9)>
  <7, (5, 7, 9)>
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it forms one 3-star: <8, (3, 5, 9)>
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it forms one 3-star: <9, (1, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1] = 20, and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 2, 7)>, <1, (0, 3, 6)>, <1, (0, 3, 9)>, <1, (0, 6, 9)>, <1, (3, 6, 9)>, <2, (0, 3, 5)>, <2, (0, 3, 7)>, <2, (0, 5, 7)>, <2, (3, 5, 7)>, <3, (1, 2, 8)>, <5, (2, 6, 7)>, <5, (2, 6, 8)>, <5, (2, 7, 8)>, <5, (6, 7, 8)>, <7, (0, 5, 9)>, <7, (2, 5, 9)>, <7, (2, 7, 9)>, <7, (5, 7, 9)>,  <8, (3, 5, 9)>, <9, (1, 7, 8)>
