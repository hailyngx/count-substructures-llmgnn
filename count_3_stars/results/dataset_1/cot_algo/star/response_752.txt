Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Based on the given graph with 10 nodes and 32 edges, let's first find the neighbor nodes for each node:

Node 0: {2, 4, 8}
Node 1: {2, 5, 7, 9}
Node 2: {0, 1, 7}
Node 3: {6, 8, 9}
Node 4: {0, 5, 7, 8}
Node 5: {1, 4, 9}
Node 6: {3}
Node 7: {1, 2, 4, 9}
Node 8: {0, 3, 4}
Node 9: {1, 3, 5, 7}

Now, let's identify the 3-star configurations:

Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors 2, 7, and 9: <1, (2, 7, 9)>
Node 4 forms a 3-star with neighbors 0, 7, and 8: <4, (0, 7, 8)>
Node 7 forms a 3-star with neighbors 1, 2, and 4: <7, (1, 2, 4)>
Node 9 forms a 3-star with neighbors 1, 3, and 5: <9, (1, 3, 5)>

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is 4, so the final answer in brackets is [4].
