Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0: {3, 8}
Node 1: {7, 9}
Node 2: {3, 4}
Node 3: {0, 2, 4, 6}
Node 4: {2, 3, 7, 9}
Node 5: {8}
Node 6: {3}
Node 7: {1, 4}
Node 8: {0, 5}
Node 9: {1, 4}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars.
Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 = 8

Therefore, the final answer is [8], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<3, (0, 2, 4)>
<4, (2, 3, 7)>
<4, (2, 3, 9)>
<4, (3, 7, 9)>
