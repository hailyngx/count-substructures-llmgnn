Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {2, 6, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbor {6}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 8}
- Node 3: Neighbors {5, 6}
- Node 4: Neighbors {5, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {3, 4, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 1, 3, 7}
- Node 7: Neighbor {6}
- Node 8: Neighbors {2, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 4, 5, 8}

Next, let's identify the 3-stars formed by nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4], and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 6, 9)>
<2, (0, 8, 9)>
<6, (0, 1, 3)>
<9, (0, 4, 5)>
