Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 7, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {5, 6}
- Node 3: {1}
- Node 5: {2, 6}
- Node 6: {2, 5, 9}
- Node 7: {0}
- Node 8: {1}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 6}

Next, we identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors: nodes 0, 1, 6, and 9.
For these nodes, we calculate \( \binom{n}{3} \):
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 7

Therefore, we have a total of [7] 3-stars in the graph, and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 7, 9)>, <1, (0, 3, 8)>, <1, (0, 3, 9)>, <1, (0, 8, 9)>, <1, (3, 8, 9)>, <6, (2, 5, 9)>, <9, (0, 1, 6)>
