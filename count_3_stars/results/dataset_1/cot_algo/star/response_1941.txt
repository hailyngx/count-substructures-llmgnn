Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
The 3-star graph structure can be determined by examining the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {4}
- Node 1: {4, 6, 9}
- Node 2: {9}
- Node 3: {5, 6, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 5, 6}
- Node 5: {3, 4, 7}
- Node 6: {1, 3, 4, 8}
- Node 7: {5}
- Node 8: {3, 6}
- Node 9: {1, 2}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding them up: 1 (from node 1) + 1 (from node 3) + 4 (from node 4) + 4 (from node 6) = 10

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10], and the unique 3-stars are:
<1, (4, 6, 9)>
<3, (5, 6, 8)>
<4, (0, 5, 6)>
<4, (1, 5, 6)>
<4, (1, 4, 6)>
<4, (4, 5, 6)>
<6, (1, 3, 8)>
<6, (3, 4, 8)>
<6, (4, 5, 8)>
<6, (4, 6, 8)>
