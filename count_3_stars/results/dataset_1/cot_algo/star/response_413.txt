Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 2, 4
- Node 1: 2, 7, 8
- Node 2: 0, 1, 4, 5, 9
- Node 3: 6, 9
- Node 4: 0, 2
- Node 5: 2, 8
- Node 6: 3, 9
- Node 7: 1, 9
- Node 8: 1, 5
- Node 9: 2, 3, 6, 7

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 1, 2, and 9 have 5 neighbors each.

For each of these nodes, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars they participate in:

- For Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding up these 3-stars from all nodes, we have a total of \( 10 + 10 + 10 = 30 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the final answer is [30] and the unique 3-stars found are:

- <1, (2, 7, 8)>
- <2, (0, 1, 4)>
- <2, (0, 1, 5)>
- <2, (0, 4, 5)>
- <2, (1, 4, 5)>
- <2, (1, 5, 9)>
- <2, (4, 5, 9)>
- <9, (3, 6, 7)>
- <9, (3, 6, 9)>
- <9, (3, 7, 9)>
