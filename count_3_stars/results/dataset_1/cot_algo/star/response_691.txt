Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 7
- Node 1: 7, 8
- Node 2: 7
- Node 3: 5, 6, 7, 8
- Node 5: 3
- Node 6: 3, 8
- Node 7: 0, 1, 2, 3
- Node 8: 1, 3, 6

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 1 = 9
So, the final answer is [9] and the unique 3-stars are <3, (5, 6, 8)>, <3, (6, 7, 8)>, <7, (0, 1, 2)>, <7, (0, 1, 3)>, <7, (0, 2, 3)>, <7, (1, 2, 3)>, <8, (1, 3, 6)>, <3, (5, 6, 8)>, <7, (0, 1, 3)>.
