Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes and their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {4, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 1: {3, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 5, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 2, 3, 7, 8}
- Node 6: {2, 4}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 2, 4, 5}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 4, 5}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 3, 4}

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star.

Therefore, there are a total of [8] 3-stars in this graph.

Unique 3-stars:
- <0, (4, 7, 8)>
- <1, (3, 5, 7)>
- <2, (5, 7, 8)>
- <4, (6, 7, 8)>
- <5, (0, 2, 8)>
- <7, (1, 2, 5)>
- <8, (0, 2, 4)>
- <9, (1, 2, 4)>
