Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: neighbors are 1, 3, 4
- Node 1: neighbor is 0
- Node 2: neighbors are 7
- Node 3: neighbors are 0, 4
- Node 4: neighbors are 0, 3, 9
- Node 5: neighbors are 6, 8
- Node 6: neighbors are 5, 7, 9
- Node 7: neighbors are 2, 6, 8, 9
- Node 8: neighbors are 5, 7
- Node 9: neighbors are 4, 6, 7

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1 3-star
- Node 3: \(\binom{2}{3}\) = 0 3-stars
- Node 4: \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1 3-star
- Node 6: \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1 3-star
- Node 7: \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4 3-stars
- Node 9: \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1 3-star

So, the total number of 3-stars is 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 8, which we will put inside brackets [].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<4, (0, 3, 9)>
<6, (5, 7, 9)>
<7, (2, 6, 8)>
<7, (6, 8, 9)>
<7, (6, 9, 4)>
<7, (8, 5, 6)>
<9, (4, 6, 7)>
