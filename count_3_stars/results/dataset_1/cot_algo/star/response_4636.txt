Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {4, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {3, 4}
- Node 2: Neighbors {3, 8}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 2, 4, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 1, 3, 6}
- Node 5: Neighbors {7, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 4, 7}
- Node 7: Neighbors {5, 6}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 2}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 3, 5}

Now, we need to identify nodes that have 3 or more neighbors to form 3-stars:

- Node 0: 4 neighbors ≥ 3 -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: 4 neighbors ≥ 3 -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars is \( 4 + 4 = 8 \), so we put this inside brackets [].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (4, 6, 8)>
- <0, (4, 6, 9)>
- <0, (4, 8, 9)>
- <3, (1, 2, 4)>
- <3, (1, 2, 9)>
- <3, (1, 4, 9)>
- <3, (2, 4, 9)>

Therefore, the answer is [8], and the unique 3-stars are <0, (4, 6, 8)>, <0, (4, 6, 9)>, <0, (4, 8, 9)>, <3, (1, 2, 4)>, <3, (1, 2, 9)>, <3, (1, 4, 9)>, <3, (2, 4, 9)>.
