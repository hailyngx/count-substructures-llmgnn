Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2
- Node 1: 0, 6
- Node 2: 0, 8
- Node 4: 5, 7, 8, 9
- Node 5: 4, 8
- Node 6: 1, 7
- Node 7: 4, 6
- Node 8: 2, 4, 5
- Node 9: 4

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <4, (5, 7, 8)>
- <4, (5, 8, 9)>
- <4, (7, 8, 9)>
- <4, (5, 7, 9)>
