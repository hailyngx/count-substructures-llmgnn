Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: 1, 7, 8
- Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 4, 6
- Node 2: 1, 4
- Node 3: 1, 4
- Node 4: 1, 2, 3, 6
- Node 5: 9
- Node 6: 1, 4, 8
- Node 7: 0, 9
- Node 8: 0, 6
- Node 9: 5, 7

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 1: <1, (0, 3, 4)>, <1, (0, 4, 6)>
- Node 4: <4, (1, 2, 6)>
- Node 6: <6, (1, 4, 8)>

The total number of 3-stars is 3, so the final answer is [3].
