Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we can create the adjacency list for each node:

Node 0: {7, 8, 9}
Node 1: {6}
Node 2: {4, 5}
Node 3: {5, 7}
Node 4: {2, 5}
Node 5: {2, 3, 4}
Node 6: {1, 7}
Node 7: {0, 3, 6, 8, 9}
Node 8: {0, 7, 9}
Node 9: {0, 7, 8}

Let's now identify the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0: []
Node 1: []
Node 2: []
Node 3: []
Node 4: []
Node 5: []
Node 6: []
Node 7: [1] <0, 8, 9>, <1, 6, 8>, <1, 6, 9>
Node 8: []
Node 9: []

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [3], and the unique 3-stars are <0, 8, 9>, <1, 6, 8>, <1, 6, 9>.
