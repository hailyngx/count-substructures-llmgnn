Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 34 edges, we will first find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0 has neighbors: 1, 4, 5, 6, 8
- Node 1 has neighbors: 0, 3, 7
- Node 2 has neighbors: 3, 6, 8
- Node 3 has neighbors: 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9
- Node 4 has neighbors: 0, 3, 9
- Node 5 has neighbors: 0, 3
- Node 6 has neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 8
- Node 7 has neighbors: 1
- Node 8 has neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 6
- Node 9 has neighbors: 3, 4

Next, we will identify the 3-star configurations:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars with its neighbors
- Node 3 has 7 neighbors, so it can form inom{7}{3} = 35 3-stars with its neighbors

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 35 = 45

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [45] and the unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (1, 5, 8)>, <0, (4, 8, 9)>, <1, (0, 3, 7)>, <3, (2, 6, 8)>.
