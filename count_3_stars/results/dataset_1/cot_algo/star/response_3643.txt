Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 1: 2, 4, 7, 8
- Node 2: 1
- Node 3: 4
- Node 4: 1, 3, 6, 7, 8
- Node 5: 6, 7
- Node 6: 4, 5, 9
- Node 7: 1, 4, 5, 9
- Node 8: 1, 4, 9
- Node 9: 6, 7, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.

Adding these up: 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 21

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [21], and the unique 3-stars are:
<1, (4, 7, 8)>
<4, (1, 6, 7)>
<4, (1, 7, 8)>
<4, (6, 7, 8)>
<7, (1, 4, 5)>
