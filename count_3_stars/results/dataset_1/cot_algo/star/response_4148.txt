Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 46 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 4, 8}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 2, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {1, 3, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {2, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 4, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors {5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {2, 6, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 9: Neighbors {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
- Node 0: 0 3-stars
- Node 1: 1 3-star <1, (2, 5, 8)>
- Node 2: 1 3-star <2, (1, 3, 9)>
- Node 3: 0 3-stars
- Node 4: 0 3-stars
- Node 5: 1 3-star <5, (1, 4, 9)>
- Node 6: 0 3-stars
- Node 7: 0 3-stars
- Node 8: 1 3-star <8, (1, 2, 5)>
- Node 9: 1 3-star <9, (1, 2, 5)>

There are a total of 5 3-stars in this graph, so the final count is [5].
