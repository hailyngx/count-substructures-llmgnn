Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find the set of neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 4, 8}
- Node 1: {0, 7}
- Node 2: {0, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 3: {5, 7}
- Node 4: {0, 6, 8}
- Node 5: {3, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {2, 4, 8}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 3, 5}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 4, 6}
- Node 9: {5}

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Nodes 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 have three or more neighbors.

For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars they participate in:
- For nodes 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8, \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars can be formed with them.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 5 \times 4 = 20 \). 

So, the final answer is [20] and the unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (1, 2, 8)>
- <2, (0, 6, 8)>
- <4, (0, 6, 8)>
- <6, (2, 4, 8)>
- <8, (0, 2, 4)>
