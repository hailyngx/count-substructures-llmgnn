Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 5, 9}
- Node 1: {3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {3, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 2, 4, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 3, 8}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 2, 9}
- Node 6: {1, 2}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 4}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 3, 5}

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 6 neighbors, so it can form inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: [20 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 38]

Unique 3-stars:
- <1, (3, 4, 6)>
- <1, (3, 4, 8)>
- <1, (3, 6, 8)>
- <1, (4, 6, 8)>
- <3, (0, 1, 2)>
- <3, (0, 1, 4)>
- <3, (0, 2, 4)>
- <3, (1, 2, 4)>
- <1, (5, 6, 8)>
- <3, (1, 9, 5)>
- <3, (0, 9, 5)>
- <3, (2, 9, 5)>
- <9, (0, 1, 5)>
- <9, (0, 2, 5)>
- <5, (1, 3, 9)>
- <5, (0, 3, 9)>
