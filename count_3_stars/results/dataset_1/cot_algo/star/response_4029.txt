Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 3, 8, 9
- Node 1: 3, 6, 9
- Node 2: 5, 8, 9
- Node 3: 0, 1, 4, 7, 8
- Node 4: 3
- Node 5: 2
- Node 6: 1, 8
- Node 7: 3
- Node 8: 0, 2, 3, 6, 9
- Node 9: 0, 1, 2, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars using the given formula:

For Node 0, inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
For Node 1, inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
For Node 2, inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
For Node 3, inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
For Node 8, inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
For Node 9, inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 27 3-stars

Therefore, the final answer is [27] and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 8, 9)>
<1, (3, 6, 9)>
<2, (5, 8, 9)>
<3, (0, 1, 4)>
<3, (0, 1, 7)>
<3, (0, 1, 8)>
<3, (0, 4, 7)>
<3, (0, 4, 8)>
<3, (0, 7, 8)>
<3, (1, 4, 7)>
<3, (1, 4, 8)>
<3, (1, 7, 8)>
<8, (0, 2, 9)>
<8, (0, 3, 6)>
<8, (0, 6, 9)>
<8, (2, 3, 9)>
<8, (2, 6, 9)>
<8, (3, 6, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 8)>
<9, (0, 2, 8)>
<9, (0, 8, 1)>
<9, (0, 8, 2)>
<9, (1, 2, 8)>
<9, (1, 8, 2)>
<9, (2, 8, 1)>
<9, (2, 8, 0)>
<9, (8, 1, 2)>
