Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 1, 8
- Node 1: 0, 2, 4
- Node 2: 1, 7, 9
- Node 3: 8
- Node 4: 1, 5
- Node 5: 4, 8, 9
- Node 7: 2
- Node 8: 0, 3, 5, 9
- Node 9: 2, 5, 8

Next, we calculate the number of 3-stars centered at each node:

- Node 0: Does not form a 3-star (2 neighbors)
- Node 1: Does not form a 3-star (3 neighbors)
- Node 2: Does not form a 3-star (3 neighbors)
- Node 3: Does not form a 3-star (1 neighbor)
- Node 4: Does not form a 3-star (2 neighbors)
- Node 5: Does not form a 3-star (3 neighbors)
- Node 7: Does not form a 3-star (1 neighbor)
- Node 8: Forms 1 3-star
- Node 9: Forms 1 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 2. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<8, 0, 1>
<9, 2, 5> 

So, the final answer is [2].
