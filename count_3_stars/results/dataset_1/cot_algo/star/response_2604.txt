Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 4, 5, 6, 7, 9
- Node 1: 3, 9
- Node 2: 8
- Node 3: 1, 4
- Node 4: 0, 3, 5, 7, 9
- Node 5: 0, 4, 8, 9
- Node 6: 0, 7, 8
- Node 7: 0, 4, 6, 9
- Node 8: 2, 5, 6, 9
- Node 9: 0, 1, 4, 5, 7, 8

Now, let's check for 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

Adding up all the 3-stars from the nodes above, we get a total of \( [10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 20] = 48 \). 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 48, which we represent as [48].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (4, 5, 9)>
- <4, (0, 5, 9)>
- <5, (0, 4, 9)>
- <7, (0, 4, 9)>
- <9, (0, 4, 5)>
- <9, (0, 4, 7)>
- <9, (0, 5, 7)>
- <9, (4, 5, 7)>
