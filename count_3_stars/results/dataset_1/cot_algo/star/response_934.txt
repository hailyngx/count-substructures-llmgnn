Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Given the provided graph information, we can construct the neighborhood sets for each node as follows:

- Node 0: {8}
- Node 1: {2, 8}
- Node 2: {1, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 3: {8, 9}
- Node 4: {2, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {4, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {2, 5}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 3, 4, 5}
- Node 9: {3, 4, 5}

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 2 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <2, (1, 4, 7)>
- <4, (2, 5, 8)>
- <5, (4, 7, 8)>
- <8, (1, 4, 5)>
