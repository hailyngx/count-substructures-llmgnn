Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) 

Response:
First, let's create a diagram of the graph using the given edges:

```
   0 --- 5 --- 2
   |     |     |   
   6 --- 4 --- 3
    \        /
      7 ----
```

Now, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 5, 6, 7
- Node 2: 5
- Node 3: 4, 5
- Node 4: 3, 5, 6
- Node 5: 0, 2, 3, 4
- Node 6: 0, 4, 7
- Node 7: 0, 6

Now, we can see that nodes 0, 4, and 5 have 3 or more neighbors, so we need to calculate the number of 3-stars they are a part of.

For node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we have a total of [6] 3-stars in this graph.
The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, 5, 6, 7>
- <4, 3, 5, 6>
- <5, 0, 2, 3>
- <5, 0, 3, 4>
- <5, 2, 3, 4>
- <5, 3, 4, 6>
