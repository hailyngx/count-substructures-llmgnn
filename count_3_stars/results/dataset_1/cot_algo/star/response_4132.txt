Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's start by listing the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 4, 7, 9
- Node 1: 4, 5, 6, 7, 9
- Node 2: 0, 4, 6
- Node 3: 0, 5
- Node 4: 0, 1, 2, 7
- Node 5: 1, 3
- Node 6: 1, 2
- Node 7: 0, 1, 4
- Node 9: 0, 1

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Nodes 2, 4, and 7 have 3 neighbors each, so they can each form 1 3-star.
- Nodes 3, 5, 6, and 9 have less than 3 neighbors, so they cannot form any 3-stars.

Summing up all the 3-stars:
\[ [ 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1] = [23] \]

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <0, 2, 4>
- <0, 2, 6>
- <0, 3, 5>
- <0, 4, 7>
- <0, 9, 1>
- <1, 4, 7>
