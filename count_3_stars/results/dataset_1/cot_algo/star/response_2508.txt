Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 6
- Node 1: 3
- Node 2: 0, 3, 5, 6
- Node 3: 1, 2, 8
- Node 5: 2, 8
- Node 6: 0, 2, 9
- Node 8: 3, 5, 9
- Node 9: 6, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 2 and Node 8 both have 4 neighbors.

For Node 2, the number of 3-stars that can be formed is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \). The unique 3-stars are:
<2, (0, 3, 5)>, <2, (0, 3, 6)>, <2, (0, 5, 6)>, <2, (3, 5, 6)>

For Node 8, the number of 3-stars that can be formed is also \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \). The unique 3-stars are:
<8, (3, 5, 9)>, <8, (3, 5, 6)>, <8, (3, 9, 6)>, <8, (5, 9, 6)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is [8].
