Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: Neighbors are 3, 4, 6
- Node 1: Neighbors are 6, 7, 9
- Node 2: Neighbors are 3, 9
- Node 3: Neighbors are 0, 2, 4
- Node 4: Neighbors are 0, 3, 6, 8
- Node 5: Neighbor is 6
- Node 6: Neighbors are 0, 1, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9
- Node 7: Neighbor is 1
- Node 8: Neighbors are 4, 6
- Node 9: Neighbors are 1, 2, 6

Now, we'll check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors to potentially form 3-stars:

- Node 0, 3-stars: 1
- Node 1, 3-stars: 1
- Node 2 does not have 3 neighbors
- Node 3, 3-stars: 1
- Node 4, 3-stars: 1
- Node 5 does not have 3 neighbors
- Node 6, 3-stars: 1
- Node 7 does not have 3 neighbors
- Node 8 does not have 3 neighbors
- Node 9 does not have 3 neighbors

Total number of 3-stars: [4]

Unique 3-stars:
- <0, (3, 4, 6)>
- <1, (6, 7, 9)>
- <3, (0, 2, 4)>
- <4, (0, 3, 6)>
