Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 4, 9
- Node 1: 0, 2, 4
- Node 2: 0, 1, 8
- Node 3: 0, 9
- Node 4: 0, 1, 9
- Node 8: 2, 9
- Node 9: 0, 3, 4, 8

Next, we identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, 4 neighbors
- Node 9, 4 neighbors

Now, we apply the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) to each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) possible 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) possible 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 = 8

Therefore, the final answer is [8] and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<0, (1, 3, 9)>
<0, (1, 4, 9)>
<0, (2, 8, 9)>
<4, (0, 1, 2)>
<4, (0, 1, 9)>
<4, (0, 2, 8)>
<9, (0, 3, 4)>
