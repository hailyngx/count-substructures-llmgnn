Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 3, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {4, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors {2}
- Node 5: Neighbors {3, 7}
- Node 6: Neighbors {8}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 3, 5, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 3, 6, 7}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 1, 2}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes {3, 7, 8} <1, (3, 7, 8)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes {1, 3, 7} <8, (1, 3, 7)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes {0, 1, 2} <9, (0, 1, 2)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars: [3]
