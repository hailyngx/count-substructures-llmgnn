Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 4, 5, 6, 8
- Node 1: 3, 4, 8
- Node 3: 1, 7
- Node 4: 0, 1
- Node 5: 0, 6, 8
- Node 6: 0, 5, 7
- Node 7: 3, 6
- Node 8: 0, 1, 5

Now, we can see that nodes 0, 1, and 8 each have 4 or more neighbors, so we can calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - <0, (4, 5, 6)>
  - <0, (4, 5, 8)>
  - <0, (4, 6, 8)>
  - <0, (5, 6, 8)>
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - <1, (3, 4, 8)>
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - <8, (0, 1, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [4 + 1 + 1] = 6, and the unique 3-stars found are <0, (4, 5, 6)>, <0, (4, 5, 8)>, <0, (4, 6, 8)>, <0, (5, 6, 8)>, <1, (3, 4, 8)>, and <8, (0, 1, 5)>.
