Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 2) (4, 8) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list out the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1
- Node 1: 0, 7, 8, 9
- Node 2: 3
- Node 3: 2
- Node 4: 8
- Node 7: 1
- Node 8: 1, 4, 9
- Node 9: 1, 8

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors: Node 1 and Node 8.

For Node 1:
There are 4 neighbors, so we can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with Node 1 as the center. The unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (0, 7, 8)>
- <1, (0, 7, 9)>
- <1, (0, 8, 9)>
- <1, (7, 8, 9)>

For Node 8:
There are 3 neighbors, so we can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star with Node 8 as the center. The unique 3-star is:
- <8, (1, 4, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
