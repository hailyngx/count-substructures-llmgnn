Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighborhood sets for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 4}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 2: {1, 4, 5}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 6, 8}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 6, 7}
- Node 6: {1, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 7: {5, 8}
- Node 8: {1, 4, 7}
- Node 9: {6}

Next, we will check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors to form 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 24. Therefore, the final answer is [24].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (2, 5, 6)>
- <1, (2, 5, 7)>
- <1, (2, 5, 6)>
- <1, (2, 5, 7)>
- <1, (4, 6, 8)>
- <1, (4, 6, 5)>
- <1, (4, 6, 8)>
- <1, (4, 6, 5)>
- <2, (4, 5, 6)>
- <2, (4, 5, 6)>
- <4, (5, 6, 8)>
- <4, (5, 6, 8)>
