Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, we will determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors are 5 and 8
- Node 1: Neighbors are 3, 6, 7, 8, and 9
- Node 2: Neighbors are 3 and 5
- Node 3: Neighbors are 1 and 2
- Node 4: Neighbor is 9
- Node 5: Neighbors are 0 and 2
- Node 6: Neighbors are 1 and 7
- Node 7: Neighbors are 1, 6, and 9
- Node 8: Neighbors are 0 and 1
- Node 9: Neighbors are 1, 4, and 7

Next, we will identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1, Node 7, and Node 9 have three or more neighbors. 

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars:
- For Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 1 = 12

Therefore, the final answer is [12] and the unique 3-stars found are <1, (3, 6, 7)>, <1, (3, 7, 9)>.
