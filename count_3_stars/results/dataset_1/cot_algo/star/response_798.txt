Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {1, 8}
- Node 1: {0, 8}
- Node 2: {4}
- Node 3: {5, 6, 7}
- Node 4: {2, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {3, 8}
- Node 6: {3}
- Node 7: {3, 8}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 9: {4}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star: <3, (5, 6, 7)>
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star: <4, (2, 8, 9)>
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. The combinations are:
  <8, (0, 1, 4)>, <8, (0, 1, 5)>, <8, (0, 1, 7)>, <8, (0, 4, 5)>, <8, (0, 4, 7)>, <8, (0, 5, 7)>, <8, (1, 4, 5)>, <8, (1, 4, 7)>, <8, (1, 5, 7)>, <8, (4, 5, 7)>
  
The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 1 + 10 = 12].
