Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: neighbors are 5, 7, 9
- Node 1: neighbors are 2, 6, 8, 9
- Node 2: neighbors are 1, 3, 6
- Node 3: neighbors are 2, 5
- Node 4: neighbors are 6, 7
- Node 5: neighbors are 0, 3
- Node 6: neighbors are 1, 2, 4
- Node 7: neighbors are 0, 4
- Node 8: neighbor is 1
- Node 9: neighbors are 0, 1

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star: <0, (5, 7, 9)>

Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: 
<1, (2, 6, 8)>, <1, (2, 6, 9)>, <1, (6, 8, 9)>, <1, (2, 8, 9)>

Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star: <2, (1, 3, 6)>

Node 4 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.

Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star: <6, (1, 2, 4)>

Node 9 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we have a total of [1 + 4 + 1] = [6].

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (5, 7, 9)>, <1, (2, 6, 8)>, <1, (2, 6, 9)>, <1, (6, 8, 9)>, <1, (2, 8, 9)>, <2, (1, 3, 6)>, <6, (1, 2, 4)>
