Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:

- Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 4, 7
- Node 1: 0, 4, 5, 7
- Node 2: 0, 3, 4
- Node 3: 0, 2, 5, 6
- Node 4: 0, 1, 2, 8
- Node 5: 1, 3, 6, 9
- Node 6: 3, 5
- Node 7: 0, 1
- Node 8: 4, 9
- Node 9: 5, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up: 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 26. So, there are a total of 26 3-stars in this graph.
Therefore, the final answer is [26], and the unique 3-stars are <0, (1, 2, 3)>, <0, (1, 2, 4)>, <0, (1, 3, 4)>, <0, (2, 3, 4)>, <0, (1, 3, 5)>, <0, (1, 4, 5)>, <0, (3, 4, 5)>, <0, (1, 3, 7)>, <0, (1, 4, 7)>, <0, (3, 4, 7)>, <1, (3, 5, 6)>, <1, (4, 5, 6)>, <1, (3, 5, 9)>, <1, (4, 5, 9)>, <3, (5, 6, 9)>, <4, (5, 8, 9)>
