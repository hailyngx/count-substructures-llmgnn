Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 2, 8
- Node 1: 7
- Node 2: 0, 4, 5, 7, 9
- Node 3: 5, 9
- Node 4: 2, 5, 6, 7
- Node 5: 2, 3, 4, 6, 7
- Node 6: 4, 5
- Node 7: 1, 2, 4, 5
- Node 8: 0
- Node 9: 2, 3

Next, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 2 has \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4 has \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5 has \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7 has \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars is 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 28, which we will put inside brackets as [28].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <2, (4, 5, 7)>
- <5, (2, 4, 7)>
