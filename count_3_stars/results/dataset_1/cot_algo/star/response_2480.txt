Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 5
- Node 1: 5, 8
- Node 2: 4, 5, 7, 8, 9
- Node 3: 7
- Node 4: 2, 5, 9
- Node 5: 0, 1, 2, 4, 8
- Node 6: 9
- Node 7: 2, 3, 8, 9
- Node 8: 1, 2, 5, 7
- Node 9: 2, 4, 6, 7

Next, we'll determine the number of 3-stars each node belongs to:
- Node 2, 8, and 9 each have 5 neighbors, so they can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can also form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Finally, we sum up the total number of 3-stars:
\[ 10 + 10 + 10 = 30 \]

Therefore, there are 30 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (4, 8, 9)>, <5, (0, 1, 4)>, <8, (1, 2, 7)>.
