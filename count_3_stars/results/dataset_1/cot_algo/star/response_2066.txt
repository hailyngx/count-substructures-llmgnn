Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 1
Node 1: 0, 3, 4, 6
Node 2: 3, 9
Node 3: 1, 2, 5, 8
Node 4: 1, 7, 9
Node 5: 3, 8
Node 6: 1, 9
Node 7: 4, 9
Node 8: 3, 5, 9
Node 9: 2, 4, 6, 7, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

For node 1: Since it has 4 neighbors, the number of 3-stars formed with it is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \). The unique 3-stars are <1, (3, 4, 6)>, <1, (3, 4, 6)>, <1, (3, 4, 6)>, <1, (3, 4, 6)>.

For node 3: Since it has 4 neighbors, the number of 3-stars formed with it is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \). The unique 3-stars are <3, (1, 2, 5)>, <3, (1, 2, 5)>, <3, (1, 2, 5)>, <3, (1, 2, 5)>.

For node 4: Since it has 3 neighbors, there is only 1 3-star formed with it: <4, (1, 7, 9)>.

For node 6: Since it has 2 neighbors, there are no 3-stars formed with it.

For node 9: Since it has 5 neighbors, the number of 3-stars formed with it is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \). The unique 3-stars are <9, (2, 4, 7)>, <9, (2, 4, 8)>, <9, (2, 4, 6)>, <9, (2, 4, 7)>, <9, (2, 4, 8)>, <9, (2, 4, 6)>, <9, (2, 7, 8)>, <9, (2, 7, 6)>, <9, (2, 8, 6)>, <9, (4, 7, 8)>.

So, the total number of 3-stars is 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 = 19, which is written as [19].
