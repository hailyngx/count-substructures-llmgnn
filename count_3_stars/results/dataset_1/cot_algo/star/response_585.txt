Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 7
- Node 1: 0, 2, 4, 8, 9
- Node 2: 1, 4, 7
- Node 3: 4, 8, 9
- Node 4: 1, 2, 3, 7, 8
- Node 6: 7
- Node 7: 0, 2, 4, 6
- Node 8: 1, 3, 4, 9
- Node 9: 1, 3, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors (2, 4, 8). This results in 1 unique 3-star <1, (2, 4, 8)>.
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with neighbors (1, 2, 8). This results in 1 unique 3-star <4, (1, 2, 8)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
