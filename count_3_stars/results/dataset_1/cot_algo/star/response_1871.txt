Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 8) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's calculate the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: neighbors {2, 4}
- Node 1: neighbor {2}
- Node 2: neighbors {0, 1, 4, 7}
- Node 3: neighbor {9}
- Node 4: neighbors {0, 2, 8}
- Node 7: neighbors {2, 9}
- Node 8: neighbor {4}
- Node 9: neighbors {3, 7}

Now let's calculate the number of 3-star subgraphs:
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 also has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4 + 1] = 5.

The unique 3-star subgraphs are:
- <2, (0, 1, 4)>
- <2, (0, 1, 7)>
- <2, (0, 4, 7)>
- <2, (1, 4, 7)>
- <4, (0, 2, 8)>
