Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes are labeled from 0 to 9. Let's first list the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {4, 5, 7}
- Node 1: {6}
- Node 2: {3, 7}
- Node 3: {2, 5}
- Node 4: {0, 8}
- Node 5: {0, 3, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {1}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {4, 7}
- Node 9: {5, 7}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars formed with them:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 4 + 10 + 0] = [15] \).

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (4, 5, 7)>, <5, (0, 3, 7)>, <7, (0, 5, 8)>, <7, (0, 5, 9)>, <7, (2, 5, 9)>, <7, (4, 5, 9)>, <7, (7, 8, 9)>, <7, (7, 9, 9)>, <7, (8, 9, 9)>, <7, (7, 8, 9)>.
