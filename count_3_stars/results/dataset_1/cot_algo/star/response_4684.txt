Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {2, 4, 7}
- Node 1: {3, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 4, 8}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 6, 8}
- Node 5: {6, 8}
- Node 6: {4, 5, 9}
- Node 7: {0}
- Node 8: {2, 3, 4, 5}
- Node 9: {1, 6}

Next, we will identify the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 2 forms a 3-star with neighbors {0, 4, 8}
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with neighbors {1, 2, 8}
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with neighbors {0, 2, 8}
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with neighbors {4, 5, 9}

Now, we count the total number of 3-stars: [4].

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in this graph are: <2, (0, 4, 8)>, <3, (1, 2, 8)>, <4, (0, 2, 8)>, <6, (4, 5, 9)>.
