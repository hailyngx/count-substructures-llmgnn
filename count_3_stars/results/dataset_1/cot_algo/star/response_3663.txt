Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 2, 8, 9
- Node 1: 3, 7
- Node 2: 0, 3, 4, 5, 6
- Node 3: 1, 2, 4, 9
- Node 4: 2, 3, 6
- Node 5: 2
- Node 6: 2, 4, 9
- Node 7: 1
- Node 8: 0, 9
- Node 9: 0, 3, 6, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 2, Node 3, Node 4, Node 6, Node 9

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 21

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [21]. 
The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (2, 8, 9)>
<2, (0, 3, 4)>
<3, (1, 2, 9)>
<4, (2, 3, 6)>
<6, (2, 4, 9)>
<9, (0, 3, 8)>
