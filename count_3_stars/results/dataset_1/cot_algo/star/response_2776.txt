Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 3, 7, 8
- Node 1: 7, 8
- Node 2: 3, 4, 5
- Node 3: 0, 2, 4, 5, 6
- Node 4: 2, 3
- Node 5: 2, 3, 6
- Node 6: 3, 5
- Node 7: 0, 1, 8
- Node 8: 0, 1, 7

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars using the formula mentioned before:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 15

So, the final answer is [15] and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 7, 8)>, <2, (3, 4, 5)>, <3, (0, 2, 4)>, <3, (0, 2, 5)>, <3, (0, 4, 5)>, <3, (2, 4, 5)>, <3, (0, 2, 6)>, <3, (0, 5, 6)>, <3, (2, 5, 6)>, <3, (4, 5, 6)>, <5, (2, 3, 6)>, <7, (0, 1, 8)>
