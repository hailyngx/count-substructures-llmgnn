Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {4, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbor {9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {4, 6, 7}
- Node 3: Neighbors {7, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 2, 5, 7}
- Node 5: Neighbors {4, 8, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors {2, 7}
- Node 7: Neighbors {2, 3, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbors {3, 5, 7}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 1, 5}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with neighbors {0, 2, 5}: <4, (0, 2, 5)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with neighbors {2, 3, 8}: <7, (2, 3, 8)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
