Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: neighbors {2, 3, 7}
- Node 1: neighbors {4}
- Node 2: neighbors {0, 3, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 3: neighbors {0, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 4: neighbors {1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 5: neighbors {4, 9}
- Node 6: neighbors {3, 7}
- Node 7: neighbors {0, 2, 3, 4, 6}
- Node 8: neighbors {2}
- Node 9: neighbors {3, 4, 5}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, forming 10 3-stars. <2, (0, 3, 7)>, <2, (0, 4, 7)>, <2, (3, 4, 7)>, <2, (3, 7, 8)>, <2, (4, 7, 8)>, <2, (0, 3, 8)>, <2, (0, 4, 8)>, <2, (3, 4, 8)>, <2, (0, 7, 8)>, <2, (4, 7, 8)>
- Node 3 has 6 neighbors, forming 20 3-stars. <3, (0, 2, 7)>, <3, (0, 4, 7)>, <3, (2, 4, 7)>, <3, (2, 7, 8)>, <3, (4, 7, 8)>, <3, (0, 2, 8)>, <3, (0, 4, 8)>, <3, (2, 4, 8)>, <3, (0, 7, 8)>, <3, (4, 7, 8)>, <3, (2, 4, 6)>, <3, (4, 6, 7)>, <3, (3, 6, 7)>, <3, (6, 7, 9)>, <3, (3, 7, 9)>, <3, (0, 2, 3)>, <3, (2, 3, 4)>, <3, (3, 4, 9)>, <3, (3, 6, 9)>, <3, (3, 7, 9)>
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors, forming 20 3-stars. <4, (1, 2, 7)>, <4, (1, 3, 7)>, <4, (2, 3, 7)>, <4, (2, 7, 8)>, <4, (3, 7, 8)>, <4, (1, 2, 8)>, <4, (1, 3, 8)>, <4, (2, 3, 8)>, <4, (1, 7, 8)>, <4, (3, 7, 8)>, <4, (2, 3, 5)>, <4, (3, 5, 9)>, <4, (4, 5, 9)>, <4, (5, 7, 9)>, <4, (4, 7, 9)>, <4, (1, 2, 3)>, <4, (2, 3, 9)>, <4, (3, 5, 9)>, <4, (3, 7, 9)>, <4, (4, 7, 9)>

In total, there are 50 3-stars in this graph, so the final result is [50].
