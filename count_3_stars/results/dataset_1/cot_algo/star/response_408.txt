Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the edge list provided, we can construct the adjacency list for the graph:

Node 0: [1, 6, 7, 8]
Node 1: [0, 4, 5]
Node 2: [7]
Node 3: [5, 9]
Node 4: [1, 7]
Node 5: [1, 3, 7, 8]
Node 6: [0]
Node 7: [0, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9]
Node 8: [0, 5, 7]
Node 9: [3, 7]

Now, let's analyze each node to see if a 3-star can be formed:

Node 0: has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
Node 1: has 3 neighbors, so it can form only 1 3-star.
Node 2: has 1 neighbor, which is not enough to form a 3-star.
Node 3: has 2 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star.
Node 4: has 2 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star.
Node 5: has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
Node 6: has 1 neighbor, which is not enough to form a 3-star.
Node 7: has 6 neighbors, so it can form inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars.
Node 8: has 3 neighbors, so it can form only 1 3-star.
Node 9: has 2 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 20 + 1 = 30
Therefore, the final number of 3-stars is [30].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 7, 8)>
<0, (1, 7, 5)>
<0, (1, 7, 4)>
<0, (6, 7, 8)>
<1, (0, 7, 5)>
<1, (0, 7, 4)>
<1, (4, 7, 5)>
<5, (0, 7, 8)>
<5, (1, 7, 8)>
<5, (1, 7, 4)>
<5, (3, 7, 9)>
<7, (0, 1, 5)>
<7, (0, 1, 4)>
<7, (0, 8, 5)>
<7, (0, 5, 8)>
<7, (1, 5, 8)>
<7, (1, 5, 4)>
<7, (3, 5, 9)>
<7, (4, 1, 5)>
<8, (0, 7, 5)>
