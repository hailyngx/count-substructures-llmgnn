Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {1, 4}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {1, 5, 8}
- Node 3: {7, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 5}
- Node 5: {2, 4, 7}
- Node 6: {7, 8}
- Node 7: {3, 5, 6}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 3, 6}
- Node 9: {1}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

Node 1 forms a 3-star with leaves {2, 8, 9} => <1, (2, 8, 9)>
Node 2 forms a 3-star with leaves {1, 5, 8} => <2, (1, 5, 8)>
Node 3, 4, 6, and 9 do not form any 3-stars as they have less than 3 neighbors.
Node 5 also does not form any 3-stars as all its neighbors are already part of other 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
