Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9. Let's first find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 3, 5, 7
- Node 1: 9
- Node 2: 7, 8
- Node 3: 0, 4, 7
- Node 4: 3
- Node 5: 0, 9
- Node 6: 8, 9
- Node 7: 0, 2, 3
- Node 8: 2, 6
- Node 9: 1, 5, 6

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

1. Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 5, and 7: <0, (3, 5, 7)> 
2. Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 4, and 7: <3, (0, 4, 7)>
3. Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 2, and 3: <7, (0, 2, 3)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
