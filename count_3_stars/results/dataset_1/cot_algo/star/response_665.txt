Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 2, 3, 4
Node 1: 5, 6, 8, 9
Node 2: 0, 7, 8
Node 3: 0, 9
Node 4: 0, 7, 8, 9
Node 5: 1
Node 6: 1
Node 7: 2, 4
Node 8: 1, 2, 4
Node 9: 1, 3, 4

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

Node 0: Forms 3-stars with (2, 3, 4)
Node 1: Forms 3-stars with (5, 6, 8), (5, 6, 9), (5, 8, 9), (6, 8, 9)
Node 2: Forms 3-stars with (7, 8, 4)
Node 4: Forms 3-stars with (8, 9, 1)

Now we can count the total number of 3-stars:

\[ \left[ 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 \right] = [7] \]

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 3, 4)>, <1, (5, 6, 8)>, <1, (5, 6, 9)>, <1, (5, 8, 9)>, <1, (6, 8, 9)>, <2, (7, 8, 4)>, <4, (8, 9, 1)>
