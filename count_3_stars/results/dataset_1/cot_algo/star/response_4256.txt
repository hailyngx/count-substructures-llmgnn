Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 28 edges, let's determine the number of 3-stars in this graph:

1. For node 0: (0, 2), (0, 8)
   - Node 0 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed.

2. For node 1: (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 7), (1, 8)
   - Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form a 3-star. Total 3-stars: 1
      <1, (4, 5, 7)>

3. For node 2: (2, 0), (2, 5), (2, 7), (2, 8)
   - Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form a 3-star. Total 3-stars: 1
      <2, (0, 5, 7)>

4. For node 3: (3, 8)
   - Node 3 has 1 neighbor, so no 3-star is formed.

5. For node 4: (4, 1), (4, 9)
   - Node 4 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed.

6. For node 5: (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 7), (5, 8)
   - Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form a 3-star. Total 3-stars: 1
      <5, (1, 2, 7)>

7. For node 7: (7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 5), (7, 8)
   - Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form a 3-star. Total 3-stars: 1
      <7, (1, 2, 5)>

8. For node 8: (8, 0), (8, 1), (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 5), (8, 7)
   - Node 8 has 6 neighbors, so it can form inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars. Total 3-stars: 20
      <8, (0, 1, 2)>, <8, (0, 1, 3)>, <8, (0, 1, 5)>, <8, (0, 1, 7)>, <8, (0, 2, 3)>, <8, (0, 2, 5)>, <8, (0, 2, 7)>, <8, (1, 2, 3)>, <8, (1, 2, 5)>, <8, (1, 2, 7)>, <8, (1, 2, 8)>, <8, (1, 3, 5)>, <8, (1, 3, 7)>, <8, (1, 5, 7)>, <8, (1, 5, 8)>, <8, (1, 7, 8)>, <8, (2, 3, 5)>, <8, (2, 3, 7)>, <8, (3, 5, 7)>, <8, (5, 7, 8)>

9. For node 9: (9, 4)
   - Node 9 has 1 neighbor, so no 3-star is formed.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1 + 1 + 1 + 20] = 23. 

The unique 3-stars found are: <1, (4, 5, 7)>, <2, (0, 5, 7)>, <5, (1, 2, 7)>, <7, (1, 2, 5)>, <8, (0, 1, 2)>, <8, (0, 1, 3)>, <8, (0, 1, 5)>, <8, (0, 1, 7)>, <8, (0, 2, 3)>, <8, (0, 2, 5)>, <8, (0, 2, 7)>, <8, (1, 2, 3)>, <8, (1, 2, 5)>, <8, (1, 2, 7)>, <8, (1, 2, 8)>, <8, (1, 3, 5)>, <8, (1, 3, 7)>, <8, (1, 5, 7)>, <8, (1, 5, 8)>, <8, (1, 7, 8)>, <8, (2, 3, 5)>, <8, (2, 3, 7)>, <8, (3, 5, 7)>, <8, (5, 7, 8)>.
