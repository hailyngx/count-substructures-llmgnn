Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are as follows:

- Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9
- Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 5
- Node 2: 0, 1, 4
- Node 3: 0, 1, 4
- Node 4: 2, 3, 6, 7
- Node 5: 0, 1
- Node 6: 4, 8
- Node 7: 0, 4
- Node 8: 0, 6, 9
- Node 9: 0, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they participate in:

- Node 0 has 7 neighbors, so it can participate in \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can participate in \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can participate in \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 35 + 4 + 1 = 40, which we represent as [40].

The unique 3-stars are as follows:

- <0, (1, 3, 5)>
- <0, (1, 3, 7)>
- <0, (1, 5, 8)>
- <0, (2, 3, 4)>
- <0, (2, 4, 6)>
- <0, (2, 4, 7)>
- <0, (3, 4, 7)>
- <0, (4, 6, 8)>
- <0, (4, 7, 8)>
- <0, (4, 7, 9)>
- <1, (0, 3, 5)>
- <1, (2, 3, 4)>
- <1, (3, 4, 7)>
- <2, (0, 3, 5)>
- <2, (1, 3, 4)>
- <4, (2, 6, 8)>
- <4, (2, 7, 8)>
- <4, (2, 7, 9)>
- <4, (3, 6, 8)>
- <4, (3, 7, 8)>
- <4, (3, 7, 9)>
- <4, (6, 8, 9)>
- <4, (7, 8, 9)>
- <8, (0, 6, 9)>

All other combinations are not valid 3-stars in this graph.
