Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 4, 7, 8
- Node 1: 6, 9
- Node 2: 4
- Node 3: 5
- Node 4: 0, 2
- Node 5: 3, 8
- Node 6: 1
- Node 7: 0, 9
- Node 8: 0, 5, 9
- Node 9: 1, 7, 8

Now, we need to find 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [3] and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (4, 7, 8)>
- <8, (0, 5, 9)>
- <9, (1, 7, 8)>
