Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 0) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 7
- Node 1: 0, 4, 5, 6, 9
- Node 3: 5
- Node 4: 1, 9
- Node 5: 1, 3, 6, 9
- Node 6: 1, 5
- Node 7: 0
- Node 8: 9
- Node 9: 1, 4, 5, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \text{inom} {5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \text{inom} {4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \text{inom} {4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding them up, we have a total of [10 + 4 + 4 = 18] 3-stars.

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (4, 5, 6)>
<1, (4, 5, 9)>
<1, (4, 6, 9)>
<1, (5, 6, 9)>
<1, (5, 4, 9)>
<1, (6, 5, 9)>
<5, (1, 4, 9)>
<5, (1, 4, 9)>
<5, (1, 6, 9)>
<5, (4, 1, 9)>
<9, (1, 4, 5)>
<9, (1, 4, 5)>
<9, (1, 5, 6)>
<9, (4, 1, 5)>

Therefore, the final answer is [18].
