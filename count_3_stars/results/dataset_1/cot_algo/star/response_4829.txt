Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

1: 5, 8, 9
2: 4, 5, 6, 9
3: 8
4: 2, 6, 7, 8, 9
5: 1, 2, 9
6: 2, 4, 7
7: 4, 6, 8
8: 1, 3, 4, 7
9: 1, 2, 4, 5

Next, we'll identify nodes with at least three neighbors and count the number of unique 3-stars:

Nodes with 3 neighbors: 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 1: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 2: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 4: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 5: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 8: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 9: inom{4}{3} = 4

Total 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 24

Therefore, the final answer is [24] and the unique 3-stars are:
<1, (5, 8, 9)>
<2, (4, 6, 9)> 
<4, (6, 7, 8)>
<5, (1, 2, 9)>
<8, (1, 4, 7)>
<9, (1, 2, 4)>
