Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 6, 8, 9
- Node 1: 3, 6
- Node 2: 0, 7, 8, 9
- Node 3: 0, 1, 6, 8
- Node 4: 6
- Node 5: 6
- Node 6: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7
- Node 7: 2, 6, 8
- Node 8: 0, 2, 3, 7
- Node 9: 0, 2

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors -> inom{5}{3} = 10 ways
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors -> inom{4}{3} = 4 ways
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors -> inom{4}{3} = 4 ways
- Node 6 has 6 neighbors -> inom{6}{3} = 20 ways
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors -> inom{4}{3} = 4 ways

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 = 42

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [42], and the unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (2, 6, 8)>
<0, (3, 6, 8)>
<2, (0, 7, 8)>
<3, (0, 1, 6)>
<6, (0, 1, 3)>
<6, (0, 4, 5)>
<6, (1, 3, 7)>
