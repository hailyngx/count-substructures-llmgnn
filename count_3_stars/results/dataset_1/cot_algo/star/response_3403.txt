Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: {4, 5}
- Node 1: {4, 6}
- Node 2: {5, 8}
- Node 3: {6}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 6}
- Node 5: {0, 2}
- Node 6: {1, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 7: {8}
- Node 8: {2, 7}
- Node 9: {6}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 0: [0 choose 3] = 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 1: [2 choose 3] = 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 2: [2 choose 3] = 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 3: [1 choose 3] = 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 4: [3 choose 3] = 1 <0, (1, 6, 4)>
- Node 5: [2 choose 3] = 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 6: [4 choose 3] = 4 <6, (1, 3, 9)>, <6, (1, 4, 9)>, <6, (3, 4, 9)>, <6, (0, 1, 4)>
- Node 7: [1 choose 3] = 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 8: [2 choose 3] = 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 9: [1 choose 3] = 0 (less than 3 neighbors)

Finally, summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get: [1 + 4] = 5
Thus, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [5].

The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (1, 6, 4)>, <6, (1, 3, 9)>, <6, (1, 4, 9)>, <6, (3, 4, 9)>, <6, (0, 1, 4)>.
