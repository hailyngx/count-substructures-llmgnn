Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first determine the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors are 1, 3, 4, 7
- Node 1: Neighbors are 0, 3, 4, 5, 7
- Node 2: Neighbors are 7, 8, 9
- Node 3: Neighbors are 0, 1, 5, 7, 8
- Node 4: Neighbors are 0, 1, 7
- Node 5: Neighbors are 1, 3, 7, 8, 9
- Node 6: Neighbors are 8, 9
- Node 7: Neighbors are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8
- Node 8: Neighbors are 2, 3, 5, 6, 7
- Node 9: Neighbors are 2, 5, 6

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 7 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars.
  
Thus, the total number of 3-stars is \( [10 + 35] = 45 \).

The unique 3-stars are:
- <5, (1, 3, 8)>
- <7, (0, 1, 4)>
- <7, (0, 1, 5)>
- <7, (0, 1, 8)>
- <7, (1, 3, 5)>
- <7, (1, 3, 8)>
- <7, (1, 4, 5)>
- <7, (1, 4, 8)>
- <7, (3, 5, 8)>
- <7, (4, 5, 8)>
