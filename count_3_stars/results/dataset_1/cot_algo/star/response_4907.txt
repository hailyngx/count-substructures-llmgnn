Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 5) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {4}
- Node 1: Neighbors {5, 6, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {6, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 7, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 2}
- Node 7: Neighbors {5}
- Node 8: Neighbors {2}
- Node 9: Neighbors {1, 5}

Next, let's identify the nodes that have at least three neighbors and count the number of 3-stars:

- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors (less than 3, so no 3-star formed)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [2].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:

- <1, (5, 6, 9)>
- <5, (1, 7, 9)>
