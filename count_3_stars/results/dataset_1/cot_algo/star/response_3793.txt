Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: neighbors {1, 5}
- Node 1: neighbors {0, 3, 7, 9}
- Node 2: neighbors {4}
- Node 3: neighbors {1, 6}
- Node 4: neighbors {2, 5, 7}
- Node 5: neighbors {0, 4, 6}
- Node 6: neighbors {3, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 7: neighbors {1, 4, 6}
- Node 8: neighbors {9}
- Node 9: neighbors {1, 6, 8}

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (3, 7, 9)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star: <4, (2, 5, 7)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star: <6, (3, 5, 7)>, <6, (1, 7, 9)>, <6, (5, 7, 9)>

Total number of 3-stars: [6]
