Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node based on the given edge list:

- Node 0: Neighbors {3}
- Node 1: Neighbors {4, 7}
- Node 2: Neighbors {7, 8, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 4, 7}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 3, 6}
- Node 6: Neighbors {4, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 2, 3}
- Node 8: Neighbors {2}
- Node 9: Neighbors {2, 6}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:

- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors (less than 3), so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors (less than 3), so it cannot form any 3-star.

Counting the total number of 3-stars formed gives us a total of [1+1+1+1] = 4.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <2, (7, 8, 9)>
- <3, (0, 4, 7)>
- <4, (1, 3, 6)>
- <7, (1, 2, 3)>
