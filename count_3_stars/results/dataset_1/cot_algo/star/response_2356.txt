Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's create an adjacency list based on the given edges:

Node 0: 5
Node 1: 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Node 2: 3, 8, 9
Node 3: 1, 2, 5, 9
Node 4: 5, 7
Node 5: 0, 1, 3, 4, 9
Node 6: 1, 7
Node 7: 1, 4, 6, 9
Node 8: 1, 2, 9
Node 9: 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 7, and 9: <1, (6, 7, 9)>
Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 2, and 5: <3, (1, 2, 5)>
Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 4, and 9: <5, (3, 4, 9)>
Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 4, and 9: <7, (1, 4, 9)>
Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, and 5: <9, (1, 3, 5)>

Since all nodes with 3 or more neighbors have been accounted for, the total number of 3-stars is 5, which we represent as [5].
