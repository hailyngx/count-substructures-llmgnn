Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, we first need to determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: neighbors {4, 6, 9}
- Node 1: neighbors {6, 7, 9}
- Node 2: neighbors {3, 4, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 3: neighbors {2, 5}
- Node 4: neighbors {0, 2, 8}
- Node 5: neighbors {2, 3, 9}
- Node 6: neighbors {0, 1, 2, 7, 8}
- Node 7: neighbors {1, 6, 9}
- Node 8: neighbors {4, 6}
- Node 9: neighbors {0, 1, 2, 5, 7}

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors that can form 3-stars:
- Node 0: can form 1 3-star
- Node 1: can form 1 3-star
- Node 2: can form 10 3-stars
- Node 6: can form 5 3-stars
- Node 9: can form 10 3-stars

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
1 (from Node 0) + 1 (from Node 1) + 10 (from Node 2) + 5 (from Node 6) + 10 (from Node 9) = 27

Therefore, there are 27 3-stars in this graph.
