Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 4, 6}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0}
- Node 2: Neighbors {7, 8}
- Node 3: Neighbors {9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 6, 7}
- Node 5: Neighbors {6, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 7: Neighbors {2, 4, 6}
- Node 8: Neighbors {2}
- Node 9: Neighbors {3, 5}

Now, we will see which nodes have 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0, 4, 6, and 7 have 3 neighbors each, we can form 1 3-star with each of them using the formula \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \).
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Nodes 3, 5, and 8 have less than 3 neighbors, so they cannot form a 3-star.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (1, 4, 6)>
- <4, (0, 6, 7)>
- <6, (0, 4, 5)>
- <7, (2, 4, 6)>
