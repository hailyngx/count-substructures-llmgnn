Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbor nodes for each node:

Node 0: 5, 6
Node 1: 3, 6, 7
Node 2: 3, 5, 8
Node 3: 1, 2, 5, 6, 7
Node 4: 8, 9
Node 5: 0, 2, 3, 6, 7, 9
Node 6: 0, 1, 3, 5, 9
Node 7: 1, 3, 5
Node 8: 2, 4
Node 9: 4, 5, 6

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they participate in:

Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

\[ Total 3-stars = 10 + 20 + 10 = 40 \]

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 40.

The unique 3-stars are:
<3, (1, 2, 5)>
<5, (0, 3, 6)>
<5, (2, 3, 7)>
<5, (3, 6, 9)>
<6, (0, 1, 5)>
