Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {5, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 1: {3, 4, 6}
- Node 2: {3, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 5, 6}
- Node 5: {0, 4, 7}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 4}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 5, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 3}
- Node 9: {3, 7}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3, so no 3-star is formed.

Adding up all the 3-stars: \( 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 24 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [24], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (5, 7, 8)>
- <0, (6, 4, 1)>
- <0, (6, 4, 5)>
- <0, (6, 1, 3)>
- <0, (6, 4, 2)>
- <0, (1, 4, 2)>
- <0, (1, 3, 2)>
- <0, (4, 5, 7)>
- <2, (4, 1, 3)>
- <2, (4, 1, 1)>
- <2, (4, 1, 2)>
- <2, (1, 4, 2)>
- <2, (1, 3, 2)>
- <2, (4, 5, 7)>
- <3, (8, 9, 1)>
- <3, (8, 9, 2)>
- <3, (8, 9, 4)>
- <3, (1, 2, 4)>
- <4, (5, 7, 0)>
- <4, (5, 7, 2)>
- <4, (5, 7, 4)>
- <4, (7, 5, 0)>
