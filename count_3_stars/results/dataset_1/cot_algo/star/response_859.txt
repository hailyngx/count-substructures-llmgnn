Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {7}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 7}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 7}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 6, 9}
- Node 4: {9}
- Node 5: {7}
- Node 6: {3, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 2, 5, 8}
- Node 8: {7, 9}
- Node 9: {3, 4, 6, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-star configurations:
- Node 1 forms one 3-star: <1, (2, 3, 7)>
- Node 2 forms one 3-star: <2, (1, 3, 7)>
- Node 3 forms four 3-stars: <3, (1, 2, 6)>, <3, (1, 2, 9)>, <3, (1, 6, 9)>, <3, (2, 6, 9)>
- Node 7 forms one 3-star: <7, (1, 2, 5)>

The total number of 3-stars is 6, so the final answer is [6].
