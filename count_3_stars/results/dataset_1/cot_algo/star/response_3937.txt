Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 5, 8}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 5}
- Node 2: {4, 6, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 7}
- Node 4: {2, 7}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {2, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {3, 4, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 5, 6}
- Node 9: {2, 5, 6, 7}

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 1, Node 2, Node 5, Node 6, Node 7, Node 8, Node 9

For these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 14

Therefore, the final answer is [14], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (1, 5, 8)>
- <1, (0, 3, 5)>
- <2, (4, 6, 9)>
- <5, (0, 8, 9), (1, 8, 9), (0, 1, 9), (0, 1, 8)>
- <6, (2, 8, 9)>
- <7, (3, 4, 9)>
- <8, (0, 5, 6)>
- <9, (2, 5, 6), (3, 5, 7), (4, 6, 7), (5, 6, 7)>
