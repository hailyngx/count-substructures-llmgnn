Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 2: 4, 7, 9
- Node 3: 5
- Node 4: 2, 7
- Node 5: 3, 8
- Node 6: 7, 8
- Node 7: 2, 4, 6
- Node 8: 5, 6, 9
- Node 9: 2, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with neighbors 4, 7, and 9: <2, (4, 7, 9)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with neighbors 2, 4, and 6: <7, (2, 4, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars [] = 2.
