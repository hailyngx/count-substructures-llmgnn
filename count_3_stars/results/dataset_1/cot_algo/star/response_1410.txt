Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
Following the steps for finding 3-star graphs:

1. Create a list of neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {6, 7}
- Node 1: {3}
- Node 2: {4, 7}
- Node 3: {1, 4, 9}
- Node 4: {2, 3, 8}
- Node 5: {7}
- Node 6: {0, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 5, 6}
- Node 8: {4, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {3, 8}

2. Identify nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 2, Node 3, Node 4, Node 6, Node 7, Node 8, and Node 9 have three or more neighbors.

3. Calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 0 3-star
- Node 2: 1 3-star <2, (4, 7, 0)>
- Node 3: 1 3-star <3, (1, 4, 9)>
- Node 4: 1 3-star <4, (2, 3, 8)>
- Node 6: 1 3-star <6, (0, 7, 8)>
- Node 7: 1 3-star <7, (0, 2, 5)>
- Node 8: 1 3-star <8, (4, 6, 9)>
- Node 9: 0 3-star

4. Sum up the total number of 3-stars:
- [5]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 5, and the unique 3-stars found are <2, (4, 7, 0)>, <3, (1, 4, 9)>, <4, (2, 3, 8)>, <6, (0, 7, 8)>, and <7, (0, 2, 5)>.
