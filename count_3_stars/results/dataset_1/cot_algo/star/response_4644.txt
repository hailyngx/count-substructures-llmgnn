Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
Since this graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges, we can proceed with analyzing the graph to find the 3-stars:

1. **Node 0**: Neighbors are 3, 5, and 6. Forms a 3-star with nodes (3, 5, 6).
2. **Node 1**: Neighbors are 2, 4, 5, 8, and 9. Forms 10 3-stars with nodes (2, 5, 8), (2, 5, 9), (4, 5, 8), (4, 5, 9), (5, 2, 8), (5, 2, 9), (5, 4, 8), (5, 4, 9), (8, 2, 5), (9, 2, 5).
3. **Node 2**: Neighbors are only node 1. Does not form a 3-star.
4. **Node 3**: Neighbors are 0, 5, and 8. Forms a 3-star with nodes (0, 5, 8).
5. **Node 4**: Neighbors are 1, 6, and 7. Forms a 3-star with nodes (1, 6, 7).
6. **Node 5**: Neighbors are 0, 1, 2, 3, and 9. Forms 10 3-stars with nodes (0, 1, 3), (0, 1, 9), (0, 2, 3), (0, 2, 9), (1, 0, 3), (1, 0, 9), (1, 2, 3), (1, 2, 9), (3, 0, 8), (9, 0, 8).
7. **Node 6**: Neighbors are 0, 4, and 7. Forms a 3-star with nodes (0, 4, 7).
8. **Node 7**: Neighbors are 4, 6, and 8. Forms a 3-star with nodes (4, 6, 8).
9. **Node 8**: Neighbors are 1, 3, 7. Forms a 3-star with nodes (1, 3, 7).
10. **Node 9**: Neighbors are 1 and 5. Does not form a 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars gives $1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 26$, which will be written as [26].

The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (3, 5, 6)>, <1, (2, 5, 8)>, <1, (2, 5, 9)>, <1, (4, 5, 8)>, <1, (4, 5, 9)>, <1, (5, 2, 8)>, <1, (5, 2, 9)>, <1, (5, 4, 8)>, <1, (5, 4, 9)>, <1, (8, 2, 5)>, <1, (9, 2, 5)>, <3, (0, 5, 8)>, <4, (1, 6, 7)>, <5, (0, 1, 3)>, <5, (0, 1, 9)>, <5, (0, 2, 3)>, <5, (0, 2, 9)>, <5, (1, 2, 3)>, <5, (1, 2, 9)>, <5, (3, 0, 8)>, <5, (9, 0, 8)>, <6, (0, 4, 7)>, <7, (4, 6, 8)>, <8, (1, 3, 7)>
