Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 1: 2, 7
- Node 2: 1, 6
- Node 3: 8
- Node 4: 5, 9
- Node 5: 4, 9
- Node 6: 2
- Node 7: 1
- Node 8: 3, 9
- Node 9: 4, 5, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-star formations:
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 3 has 1 neighbor, so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 6 has 1 neighbor, so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 7 has 1 neighbor, so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so 1 3-star is formed.

Putting the final number of 3-stars inside brackets:
\[ [1] \]

Listing the unique 3-stars found:
<9, (4, 5, 8)>
