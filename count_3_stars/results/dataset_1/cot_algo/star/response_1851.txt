Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {2, 6, 7}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 4: {2, 3, 5, 8}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 5, 8}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 8}
- Node 8: {3, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 5}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with its neighbors (2, 5, 7): <1, (2, 5, 7)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with its neighbors (1, 4, 5): <2, (1, 4, 5)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with its neighbors (1, 2, 4): <5, (1, 2, 4)>

There are 3 unique 3-stars in this graph, so the total number of 3-stars is [3].
