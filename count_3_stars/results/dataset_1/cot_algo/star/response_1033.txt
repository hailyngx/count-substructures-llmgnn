Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 7, 9
- Node 1: 5
- Node 2: 0, 6, 8
- Node 3: 9
- Node 4: 6, 8
- Node 5: 1
- Node 6: 2, 4
- Node 7: 0
- Node 8: 2, 4, 9
- Node 9: 0, 3, 8

Next, we'll identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors (3-star can be formed)
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors (3-star can be formed)
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors (3-star can be formed)
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors (3-star can be formed)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
\( \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} = 4 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (2, 7, 9)>
- <2, (0, 6, 8)>
- <8, (2, 4, 9)>
- <9, (0, 3, 8)>
