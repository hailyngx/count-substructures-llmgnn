Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 5, 6
- Node 1: 5, 6, 9
- Node 2: 0, 4
- Node 3: 0, 4, 6, 7, 9
- Node 4: 2, 3
- Node 5: 0, 1, 6, 8, 9
- Node 6: 0, 1, 3, 5
- Node 7: 3
- Node 8: 5, 9
- Node 9: 1, 3, 5, 8

Now, we can identify nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 4 neighbors, can form 4 3-stars
- Node 1: 3 neighbors, can form 1 3-star
- Node 3: 5 neighbors, can form 10 3-stars
- Node 5: 5 neighbors, can form 10 3-stars
- Node 6: 4 neighbors, can form 4 3-stars
- Node 9: 4 neighbors, can form 4 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars is the sum of these, which is 29: [29].

Now, we list the unique 3-stars found:
- <0, (2, 5, 6)>
- <3, (0, 5, 9)>
- <3, (4, 5, 9)>
- <3, (5, 6, 9)>
- <3, (5, 8, 9)>
- <5, (0, 6, 9)>
- <5, (1, 6, 9)>
- <5, (3, 6, 9)>
- <5, (8, 9, 1)>
- <5, (8, 9, 3)>
- <6, (0, 1, 5)>
- <6, (0, 5, 9)>
- <6, (1, 5, 9)>
- <9, (1, 3, 5)>
- <9, (5, 8, 1)>
- <9, (5, 8, 3)>
