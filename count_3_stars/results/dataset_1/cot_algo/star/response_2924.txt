Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 6) (4, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 9
- Node 1: 4, 6
- Node 2: 5, 6
- Node 3: 6
- Node 4: 1
- Node 5: 2, 9
- Node 6: 1, 2, 3, 7, 9
- Node 7: 6
- Node 8: 9
- Node 9: 0, 5, 6, 8

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form a 3-star.
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form a 3-star.
- Node 3 has 1 neighbor, so it doesn't form a 3-star.
- Node 4 has 1 neighbor, so it doesn't form a 3-star.
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form a 3-star.
- Node 7 has 1 neighbor, so it doesn't form a 3-star.
- Node 8 has 1 neighbor, so it doesn't form a 3-star.

Node 0 and Node 6 both have 5 neighbors, so they form 10 3-stars in total. Let's list the unique 3-stars:
- <0, (9, 5, 8)>
- <0, (9, 6, 8)>
- <0, (9, 6, 5)>
- <0, (9, 6, 7)>
- <0, (9, 5, 6)>
- <6, (1, 7, 9)>
- <6, (1, 2, 9)>
- <6, (1, 3, 9)>
- <6, (2, 5, 9)>
- <6, (3, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [10].
