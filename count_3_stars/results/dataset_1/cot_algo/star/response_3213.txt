Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {3, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {4, 5, 8}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {2, 4, 7}
- Node 6: Neighbors {4, 7, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 3, 5, 6}
- Node 8: Neighbors {2, 3, 6, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 4, 8}

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 20 + 1 + 4 = 34

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [34], and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 7, 9)>, <2, (4, 5, 8)>, <3, (0, 4, 7)>, <4, (0, 3, 9)>, <6, (4, 7, 8)>, <8, (3, 6, 9)>
