Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0: {3}
Node 1: {5}
Node 2: {9}
Node 3: {0, 4, 5, 6, 8}
Node 4: {3, 8}
Node 5: {1, 3, 7, 8, 9}
Node 6: {3, 7}
Node 7: {5, 6}
Node 8: {3, 4, 5, 9}
Node 9: {2, 5, 8}

Next, let's count the number of 3-stars formed by each node:

Node 0: 0 3-stars
Node 1: 0 3-stars
Node 2: 0 3-stars
Node 3: 3 3-stars
Node 4: 1 3-star
Node 5: 1 3-star
Node 6: 0 3-stars
Node 7: 0 3-stars
Node 8: 1 3-star
Node 9: 0 3-stars

So, there are a total of [3] 3-stars in the graph. The unique 3-stars are:
<3, (0, 4, 8)>
<4, (3, 8, 5)>
<5, (1, 9, 3)>
