Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 3, 7, 9
- Node 1: 4, 7
- Node 2: 3, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 3: 0, 2, 6
- Node 4: 1, 5, 7, 8, 9
- Node 5: 4, 8
- Node 6: 2, 3
- Node 7: 0, 1, 2, 4
- Node 8: 2, 4, 5
- Node 9: 0, 2, 4

Next, we identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 2, Node 4

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- For Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 1 + 10 + 10 = 21, which we'll represent as [21].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, 3, 7, 9>
- <2, 3, 6, 7>
- <2, 3, 7, 9>
- <2, 6, 7, 9>
- <2, 7, 8, 9>
- <4, 1, 7, 8>
- <4, 1, 7, 9>
- <4, 5, 8, 9>
- <4, 7, 8, 9>
- <8, 2, 4, 5>
