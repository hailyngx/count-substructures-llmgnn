Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: 4, 5, 8
Node 1: 4
Node 2: 4, 6
Node 3: 6
Node 4: 0, 1, 2, 9
Node 5: 0, 6, 8
Node 6: 2, 3, 5, 9
Node 7: 8, 9
Node 8: 0, 5, 7
Node 9: 4, 6, 7

Next, we will identify the 3-stars that can be formed:

Node 0 forms 1 3-star, as it has exactly 3 neighbors: <0, (4, 5, 8)>
Node 2 forms 1 3-star, as it has exactly 3 neighbors: <2, (4, 6, 9)>
Node 4 forms 1 3-star, as it has exactly 3 neighbors: <4, (0, 1, 2)>
Node 6 forms 1 3-star, as it has exactly 3 neighbors: <6, (2, 3, 5)>
Node 8 forms 1 3-star, as it has exactly 3 neighbors: <8, (0, 5, 7)>
Node 9 forms 1 3-star, as it has exactly 3 neighbors: <9, (4, 6, 7)>

Therefore, there are a total of 6 3-stars in this graph, which can be represented as [6].
