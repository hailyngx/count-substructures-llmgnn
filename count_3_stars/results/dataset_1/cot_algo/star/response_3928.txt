Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 4) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 2, 5
Node 1: 3, 6, 9
Node 2: 0, 4
Node 3: 1
Node 4: 2, 7, 8
Node 5: 0, 6
Node 6: 1, 5
Node 7: 4
Node 8: 4
Node 9: 1

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:

Node 0: 1 3-star
Node 1: 1 3-star
Node 2: 1 3-star
Node 4: 1 3-star

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<1, (3, 6, 9)>
<2, (0, 4, 7)>
<4, (2, 7, 8)>
