Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 4) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars and list them in the graph, we will first determine the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 2, 8, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 3, 4, 5}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 4, 8}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 5}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 2, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 3, 4, 7}
- Node 6: Neighbors {4}
- Node 7: Neighbors {4, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 2, 7}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 7}

Now, we will identify the 3-stars:

1. Node 0 has 4 neighbors, hence it can form 1 3-star.
2. Node 1 has 4 neighbors, hence it can form 1 3-star.
3. Node 2 has 3 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star.
4. Node 4 has 5 neighbors, hence it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
5. Node 5 has 4 neighbors, hence it can form 1 3-star.
6. Node 7 has 4 neighbors, hence it can form 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 14, which we will represent inside brackets [].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 2, 8)>
<1, (3, 4, 5)>
<4, (2, 5, 7)>
<4, (1, 5, 7)>
<4, (1, 5, 7)>
<4, (1, 2, 7)>
<4, (1, 2, 5)>
<4, (1, 2, 5)>
<5, (1, 3, 7)>
<5, (1, 3, 7)>
<5, (1, 3, 4)>
<7, (8, 9, 0)>
<7, (8, 9, 0)>
<7, (8, 4, 5)>
