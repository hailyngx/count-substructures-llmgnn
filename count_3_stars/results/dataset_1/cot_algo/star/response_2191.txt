Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 6, 7
- Node 1: 8
- Node 2: 5
- Node 3: 6
- Node 4: 5, 9
- Node 5: 2, 4, 6, 9
- Node 6: 0, 3, 5, 9
- Node 7: 0, 8
- Node 8: 1, 7
- Node 9: 4, 5, 6

Next, let's count the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: 2 neighbors (not enough)
- Node 1: 1 neighbor (not enough)
- Node 2: 1 neighbor (not enough)
- Node 3: 1 neighbor (not enough)
- Node 4: 2 neighbors (not enough)
- Node 5: 4 neighbors (forming 1 3-star)
- Node 6: 4 neighbors (forming 1 3-star)
- Node 7: 2 neighbors (not enough)
- Node 8: 2 neighbors (not enough)
- Node 9: 3 neighbors (forming \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star)

Therefore, there are a total of [2] 3-stars in the graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
- <5, (2, 4, 9)>
- <6, (0, 5, 9)>
