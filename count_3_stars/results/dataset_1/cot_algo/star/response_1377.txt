Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes are labeled from 0 to 9, and the edges are listed accordingly. Let's first identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: 3, 4, 6, 7, 9
- Node 1: 6, 7
- Node 2: 5, 6, 8
- Node 3: 0, 7
- Node 4: 0, 6, 7
- Node 5: 2, 9
- Node 6: 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 9
- Node 7: 0, 1, 3, 4
- Node 8: 2, 6, 9
- Node 9: 0, 5, 6, 8

Now, let's determine the 3-stars formed:

Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 6 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the 3-stars we found gives a total of 36 <0, (3, 4, 6)>, <0, (3, 6, 7)>, <0, (4, 6, 7)>, <0, (6, 8, 9)>, <0, (7, 8, 9)>, <0, (6, 8, 9)>, <0, (7, 8, 9)>, <0, (3, 4, 7)>, <0, (0, 7, 9)>, <0, (0, 4, 9)>, <0, (0, 6, 9)>.
So, the final total number of 3-stars in the graph is [36].
