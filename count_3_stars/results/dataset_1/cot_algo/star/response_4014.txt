Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 5, 6, 7, 8
- Node 1: 5, 7
- Node 2: 3, 4, 6, 7
- Node 3: 2, 6
- Node 4: 2
- Node 5: 0, 1, 7
- Node 6: 0, 2, 3, 9
- Node 7: 0, 1, 2, 5, 8, 9
- Node 8: 0, 7
- Node 9: 6, 7

Now, let's list the 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with neighbors (5, 6, 7)
- Node 2 forms two 3-stars with neighbors (3, 4, 6) and (4, 6, 7)
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with neighbors (0, 1, 7)
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with neighbors (0, 2, 3)

Thus, the final answer is [4] and the unique 3-stars found are <0, (5, 6, 7)>, <2, (3, 4, 6)>, <2, (4, 6, 7)>, and <5, (0, 1, 7)>.
