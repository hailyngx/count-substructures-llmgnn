Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 7, 8
- Node 1: 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 2: 4, 7
- Node 3: 9
- Node 4: 2
- Node 5: 6, 9
- Node 6: 1, 5, 9
- Node 7: 0, 1, 2
- Node 8: 0, 1
- Node 9: 1, 3, 5, 6

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 0: Does not form any 3-stars (has less than 3 neighbors).
- Node 1: Does not form any 3-stars (has less than 3 neighbors).
- Node 2: Does not form any 3-stars (has less than 3 neighbors).
- Node 3: Does not form any 3-stars (has less than 3 neighbors).
- Node 4: Does not form any 3-stars (has less than 3 neighbors).
- Node 5: Does not form any 3-stars (has less than 3 neighbors).
- Node 6: 1 3-star
- Node 7: 1 3-star
- Node 8: Does not form any 3-stars (has less than 3 neighbors).
- Node 9: 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
Therefore, the final number of 3-stars is [3].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<6, (1, 5, 9)>, <7, (0, 1, 2)>, <9, (1, 3, 6)>
