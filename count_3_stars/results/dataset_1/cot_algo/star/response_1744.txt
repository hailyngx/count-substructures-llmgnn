Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 44 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 5, 6, 7
- Node 1: 0, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 2: 0, 6, 8
- Node 3: 1, 5
- Node 4: 1, 6
- Node 5: 0, 3, 6, 8, 9
- Node 6: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8
- Node 7: 0, 1, 6, 8
- Node 8: 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 9
- Node 9: 1, 5, 8

Based on the neighbor sets, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0: None (4 neighbors, so no 3-stars)
- Node 1: <1, (0, 6, 7)>, <1, (3, 4, 9)>, <1, (5, 8, 9)>
- Node 2: None (3 neighbors, so no 3-stars)
- Node 3: None (2 neighbors, so no 3-stars)
- Node 4: None (2 neighbors, so no 3-stars)
- Node 5: <5, (0, 6, 9)>, <5, (3, 6, 8)>, <5, (6, 8, 9)>
- Node 6: <6, (0, 1, 7)>, <6, (1, 4, 8)>, <6, (2, 4, 8)>, <6, (5, 8, 9)>
- Node 7: None (4 neighbors, so no 3-stars)
- Node 8: None (6 neighbors, so no 3-stars)
- Node 9: None (3 neighbors, so no 3-stars)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 8, and they are:
<1, (0, 6, 7)>, <1, (3, 4, 9)>, <1, (5, 8, 9)>, <5, (0, 6, 9)>, <5, (3, 6, 8)>, <5, (6, 8, 9)>, <6, (0, 1, 7)>, <6, (1, 4, 8)>
