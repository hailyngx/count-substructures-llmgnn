Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. 

Let's first list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 2, 7, 8
- Node 1: 2
- Node 2: 0, 1, 4, 7, 8, 9
- Node 3: 7, 9
- Node 4: 2, 5, 6, 9
- Node 5: 4, 7
- Node 6: 4, 7, 8, 9
- Node 7: 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8
- Node 8: 0, 2, 6, 7
- Node 9: 2, 3, 4, 6

Next, we will check which nodes have three or more neighbors to potentially form 3-stars:
- Node 0: Forms a 3-star with neighbors 2, 7, 8
- Node 2: Forms a 3-star with neighbors 0, 7, 8
- Node 4: Forms a 3-star with neighbors 2, 6, 9
- Node 6: Forms a 3-star with neighbors 4, 7, 9
- Node 7: Forms a 3-star with neighbors 0, 2, 8

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars [] formed in this graph is 5.

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <0, (2, 7, 8)>
- <2, (0, 7, 8)>
- <4, (2, 6, 9)>
- <6, (4, 7, 9)>
- <7, (0, 2, 8)>
