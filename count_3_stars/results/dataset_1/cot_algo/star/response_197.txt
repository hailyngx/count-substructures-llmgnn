Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in the given graph with 10 nodes and 32 edges, we first need to identify the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: Neighbors {2, 6}
Node 1: Neighbors {4, 5, 8}
Node 2: Neighbors {0, 7, 9}
Node 3: Neighbors {5, 6}
Node 4: Neighbors {1, 5, 6, 7}
Node 5: Neighbors {1, 3, 4, 6, 9}
Node 6: Neighbors {0, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8}
Node 7: Neighbors {2, 4, 6}
Node 8: Neighbors {1, 6}
Node 9: Neighbors {2, 5}

Now, we check each node that has three or more neighbors to see if they form a 3-star:

Node 1: Forms a 3-star with neighbors {4, 5, 8} -> <1, (4, 5, 8)>
Node 2: Forms a 3-star with neighbors {0, 7, 9} -> <2, (0, 7, 9)>
Node 4: Forms a 3-star with neighbors {1, 5, 6} -> <4, (1, 5, 6)>
Node 5: Forms a 3-star with neighbors {1, 3, 4} -> <5, (1, 3, 4)>
         Forms a 3-star with neighbors {1, 4, 6} -> <5, (1, 4, 6)>
Node 6: Forms a 3-star with neighbors {3, 4, 5} -> <6, (3, 4, 5)>
         Forms a 3-star with neighbors {4, 5, 7} -> <6, (4, 5, 7)>
Node 8: Forms a 3-star with neighbors {1, 6, 8} -> <8, (1, 6, 8)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 7, so the final answer is [7].
