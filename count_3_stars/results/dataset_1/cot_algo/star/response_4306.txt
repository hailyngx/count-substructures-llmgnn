Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's create a table to summarize the neighbors of each node:

| Node | Neighbors |
|------|-----------|
| 0    | 1, 2, 7   |
| 1    | 0, 2, 3, 5, 9   |
| 2    | 0, 1, 4, 7, 8   |
| 3    | 1, 6   |
| 4    | 2, 9   |
| 5    | 1, 7   |
| 6    | 3, 7   |
| 7    | 0, 2, 5, 6   |
| 8    | 2   |
| 9    | 1, 4   |

Now, we will identify the nodes that can form 3-stars. Nodes that have three or more neighbors are candidates for forming 3-stars:

- Node 0 can form 3-stars with neighbors (1, 2, 7) -> [(0, 1, 2), (0, 1, 7), (0, 2, 7)]
- Node 1 can form 3-stars with neighbors (0, 2, 3, 5, 9) -> [(1, 0, 2), (1, 0, 3), (1, 0, 5), (1, 0, 9), (1, 2, 3), (1, 2, 5), (1, 2, 9), (1, 3, 5), (1, 3, 9), (1, 5, 9)]
- Node 2 can form 3-stars with neighbors (0, 1, 4, 7, 8) -> [(2, 0, 1), (2, 0, 4), (2, 0, 7), (2, 0, 8), (2, 1, 4), (2, 1, 7), (2, 1, 8), (2, 4, 7), (2, 4, 8), (2, 7, 8)]
- Node 4 can form a 3-star with neighbors (2, 9) -> [(4, 2, 9)]
- Node 5 can form a 3-star with neighbors (1, 7) -> [(5, 1, 7)]
- Node 7 can form 3-stars with neighbors (0, 2, 5, 6) -> [(7, 0, 2), (7, 0, 5), (7, 0, 6), (7, 2, 5), (7, 2, 6), (7, 5, 6)]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars formed in this graph is 15. Putting this number inside brackets gives us [15], and listing the unique 3-stars found inside angle brackets gives:
<0, 1, 2>, <0, 1, 7>, <0, 2, 7>, <1, 0, 2>, <1, 0, 3>, <1, 0, 5>, <1, 0, 9>, <1, 2, 3>, <1, 2, 5>, <1, 2, 9>, <1, 3, 5>, <1, 3, 9>, <1, 5, 9>, <2, 0, 1>, <2, 0, 4>, <2, 0, 7>, <2, 0, 8>, <2, 1, 4>, <2, 1, 7>, <2, 1, 8>, <2, 4, 7>, <2, 4, 8>, <2, 7, 8>, <4, 2, 9>, <5, 1, 7>, <7, 0, 2>, <7, 0, 5>, <7, 0, 6>, <7, 2, 5>, <7, 2, 6>, <7, 5, 6>
