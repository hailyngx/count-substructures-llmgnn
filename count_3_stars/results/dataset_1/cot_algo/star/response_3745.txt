Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 3, 6}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 3, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {8, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 1, 6, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors {5, 6}
- Node 5: Neighbors {4, 7}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 3, 4}
- Node 7: Neighbors {5}
- Node 8: Neighbors {2, 3, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {1, 2, 8}

Next, we will identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with leaves {1, 3, 6}: <0, (1, 3, 6)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with leaves {0, 3, 9}: <1, (0, 3, 9)>
- Node 8 forms two 3-stars with leaves {2, 3, 9} and {3, 2, 9}: <8, (2, 3, 9)>, <8, (3, 2, 9)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with leaves {1, 2, 8}: <9, (1, 2, 8)>

Total number of 3-stars: [4]
