Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 9) (5, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, we will first list out the neighbor nodes for each node:

1: {5, 8}
2: {6, 7, 8}
3: {9}
5: {1}
6: {2, 8}
7: {2}
8: {1, 2, 6, 9}
9: {3, 8}

Now, we can identify the 3-stars:
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
- There are no other nodes with 3 or more neighbors, so no additional 3-stars are formed.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 + 4 = 5, so the final answer is [5].

The unique 3-stars are:
<2, (6, 8, 9)>
<8, (1, 2, 6)>
<8, (1, 2, 9)>
<8, (1, 6, 9)>
<8, (2, 6, 9)>
