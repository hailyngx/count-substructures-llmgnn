Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 9
- Node 1: 0, 6, 7, 9
- Node 2: 3
- Node 3: 2
- Node 4: 0, 9
- Node 5: 6, 9
- Node 6: 1, 5, 8
- Node 7: 1
- Node 8: 6
- Node 9: 0, 1, 4, 5

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 1, and Node 9 have 3 or more neighbors.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

So, the total number of 3-stars is 1 + 4 + 4 = 9. 

The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (1, 4, 9)>, <1, (0, 6, 7)>, <1, (0, 6, 9)>, <1, (4, 6, 9)>, <1, (5, 6, 9)>, <9, (0, 4, 5)>. 

Therefore, the final answer is [9].
