Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 7, 8
- Node 1: 0, 5
- Node 2: 3, 9
- Node 3: 2
- Node 4: 7
- Node 5: 1, 8
- Node 6: 7
- Node 7: 0, 4, 6, 8
- Node 8: 0, 5, 7
- Node 9: 2

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1 + 4 = 5].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (1, 7, 8)>
- <7, (0, 4, 6)>
- <7, (0, 4, 8)>
- <7, (0, 6, 8)>
- <7, (4, 6, 8)>
