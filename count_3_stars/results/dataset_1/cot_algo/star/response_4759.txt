Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph in terms of its adjacency list:

Node 0: 4, 5, 6  
Node 1: 2, 3, 4, 8  
Node 2: 1, 3, 6, 7, 8  
Node 3: 1, 2, 8  
Node 4: 0, 1, 9  
Node 5: 0, 7, 9  
Node 6: 0, 2, 8  
Node 7: 2, 5, 8  
Node 8: 1, 2, 3, 6, 7  
Node 9: 4, 5  

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars in the graph:

Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.  
Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.  
Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.  
Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.  
Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.  
Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.  
Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.  
Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.  
Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.  
Node 9 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 30  

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [30].  

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:  
<0, (4, 5, 6)>  
<1, (2, 3, 4)>  
<1, (2, 4, 8)>  
<1, (3, 4, 8)>  
<1, (4, 8, 9)>  
<2, (1, 3, 8)>  
<2, (1, 6, 8)>  
<2, (3, 6, 8)>  
<2, (7, 6, 8)>  
<5, (0, 7, 9)>  
<8, (1, 3, 7)>
