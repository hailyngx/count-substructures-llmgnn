Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 1: {4, 5, 6}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {2, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 5}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 7}
- Node 7: {3, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 8: {2, 3, 5}
- Node 9: {2, 7}

Now, let's identify nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 2, and Node 5 have 4 neighbors.
- Node 1, Node 3, and Node 7 have 3 neighbors.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0, Node 2, and Node 5 each form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars, so that's \( 3 \times 4 = 12 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1, Node 3, and Node 7 each form 1 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars is \( 12 + 3 = 15 \), and they are:
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<2, (0, 3, 5)>
<5, (0, 2, 3)>
<1, (4, 5, 6)>
<3, (2, 5, 7)>
<7, (3, 5, 6)> 

Thus, the final answer is [15].
