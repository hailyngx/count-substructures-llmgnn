Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 5, 6, 9 (5 neighbors)
- Node 1: 0, 2, 4, 5, 9 (5 neighbors)
- Node 2: 1, 5, 8, 9 (4 neighbors)
- Node 3: 0, 5 (2 neighbors)
- Node 4: 1, 6, 7 (3 neighbors)
- Node 5: 0, 1, 2, 3, 7, 8 (6 neighbors)
- Node 6: 0, 4 (2 neighbors)
- Node 7: 4, 5 (2 neighbors)
- Node 8: 2, 5 (2 neighbors)
- Node 9: 0, 1, 2 (3 neighbors)

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 1 = 45

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [45], and the unique 3-stars found are <0, (1, 5, 9)>, <1, (0, 5, 9)>, <2, (1, 5, 9)>, <5, (0, 1, 9)>, <9, (0, 1, 5)>.
