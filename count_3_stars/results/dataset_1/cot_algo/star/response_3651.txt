Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: neighbors {1, 2, 3, 6}
- Node 1: neighbors {0, 3, 6, 7}
- Node 2: neighbors {0, 3}
- Node 3: neighbors {0, 1, 2, 4}
- Node 4: neighbors {3, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 5: neighbors {4, 6, 9}
- Node 6: neighbors {0, 1, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 7: neighbors {1, 4, 6}
- Node 8: neighbors {4, 9}
- Node 9: neighbors {5, 6, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:
- Node 0: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- Node 1: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- Node 3: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- Node 4: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- Node 6: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- Node 9: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

Total 3-stars: \(4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 27\)

Therefore, the final answer is [27] and the unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (1, 3, 6)>
- <1, (0, 3, 6)>
- <3, (0, 1, 4)>
- <4, (3, 5, 7)>
- <6, (0, 1, 5)>
- <9, (5, 6, 8)>
