Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The neighbors for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: {6, 7, 8}
- Node 1: {3, 6}
- Node 2: {3, 5}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 4, 8}
- Node 4: {3, 6}
- Node 5: {2, 7}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 4, 7}
- Node 7: {0, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 3}
- Node 9: {7}

Nodes 0, 3, 6, and 7 each have 4 or more neighbors, so we can calculate the number of 3-stars they participate in:
- For node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Therefore, there are a total of \(1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 13\) 3-stars in this graph, which can be represented as:
\[ [13] \]
\[ <0, (6, 7, 8)>, <3, (1, 2, 4)>, <6, (0, 1, 4)>, <7, (0, 5, 9)> \]
