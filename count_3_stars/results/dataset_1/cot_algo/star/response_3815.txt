Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 2, 4, 5}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 3, 4, 5}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 3: {1, 5}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 2, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 2, 3, 7}
- Node 6: {8}
- Node 7: {2, 5, 9}
- Node 8: {4, 6}
- Node 9: {4, 7}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have at least 3 neighbors:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors: inom{3}{3} = 1  (there is only 1 3-star with 3 neighbors)
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors.

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 1] = 45.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (1, 2, 4)>
- <1, (0, 2, 4)>
- <2, (0, 1, 4)>
- <4, (0, 1, 2)>
- <5, (0, 1, 2)>
- <7, (2, 5, 9)>
