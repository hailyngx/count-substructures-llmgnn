Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 5) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: neighbors = {1, 7}
- Node 1: neighbors = {0, 2, 4}
- Node 2: neighbors = {1, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 4: neighbors = {1, 2, 5, 6}
- Node 5: neighbors = {4, 6, 8}
- Node 6: neighbors = {4, 5}
- Node 7: neighbors = {0, 2}
- Node 8: neighbors = {5}
- Node 9: neighbors = {2}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors {0, 2, 4} <1, (0, 2, 4)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with neighbors {1, 4, 7} <2, (1, 4, 7)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with neighbors {1, 2, 5} <4, (1, 2, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [3] and the unique 3-stars are <1, (0, 2, 4)>, <2, (1, 4, 7)>, and <4, (1, 2, 5)>.
