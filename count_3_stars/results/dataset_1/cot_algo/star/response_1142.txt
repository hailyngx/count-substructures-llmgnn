Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
To begin, let's list out the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {2, 4, 5}
- Node 1: {7, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 5, 9}
- Node 3: {4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 3, 8}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 3}
- Node 6: {3}
- Node 7: {1, 3}
- Node 8: {3, 4}
- Node 9: {1, 2}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (1 3-star)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (1 3-star)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) (10 3-stars)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 1 + 10 = 12]. 

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: <0, (2, 4, 5)>, <2, (0, 5, 9)>, and <3, (4, 5, 6)>, <3, (4, 5, 7)>, <3, (4, 5, 8)>, <3, (4, 6, 7)>, <3, (4, 6, 8)>, <3, (4, 7, 8)>, <3, (5, 6, 7)>, <3, (5, 6, 8)>, <3, (5, 7, 8)>.
