Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 3, 4, 8}
- Node 1: {4, 5, 6}
- Node 2: {0}
- Node 3: {0, 5}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 6, 7}
- Node 5: {1, 3, 6}
- Node 6: {1, 4, 5}
- Node 7: {4, 8}
- Node 8: {0, 7}

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed around each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)

Therefore, a total of \( 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 11 \) 3-stars are formed in this graph.
The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (2, 3, 4)>, <0, (2, 4, 8)>, <0, (3, 4, 8)>, <0, (4, 6, 7)>, <1, (4, 5, 6)>. 
So the final answer is [11].
