Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, let's first determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {6, 9}
- Node 1: {4, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {3, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {2, 4, 8}
- Node 4: {1, 3, 6, 9}
- Node 5: {7}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {1, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 8: {2, 3, 6}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 2, 4, 7}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

- Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors {4, 6, 7}.
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with neighbors {1, 6, 9}.
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with neighbors {0, 1, 4}.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [3], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (4, 6, 7)>, <4, (1, 6, 9)>, <6, (0, 1, 4)>.
