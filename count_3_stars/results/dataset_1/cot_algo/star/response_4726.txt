Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 4
- Node 1: 2, 5, 6, 7
- Node 2: 1, 5, 8
- Node 3: 4
- Node 4: 0, 3
- Node 5: 1, 2
- Node 6: 1, 7
- Node 7: 1, 6, 8
- Node 8: 2, 7

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors (2, 5, 6, 7), so it forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars: <1, (2, 5, 6)>, <1, (2, 5, 7)>, <1, (2, 6, 7)>, <1, (5, 6, 7)>
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors (1, 5, 8), so it forms 1 3-star: <2, (1, 5, 8)>
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors (1, 6, 8), so it forms 1 3-star: <7, (1, 6, 8)>

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is [6].

Unique 3-stars:
<1, (2, 5, 6)>
<1, (2, 5, 7)>
<1, (2, 6, 7)>
<1, (5, 6, 7)>
<2, (1, 5, 8)>
<7, (1, 6, 8)>
