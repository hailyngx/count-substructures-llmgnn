Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 5, 9
- Node 1: 2, 4, 7
- Node 2: 1, 3, 4, 5
- Node 3: 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9
- Node 4: 1, 2, 3, 5, 7
- Node 5: 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9
- Node 6: 5
- Node 7: 1, 3, 4
- Node 8: 3
- Node 9: 0, 3, 5

Now, let's check the nodes that have three or more neighbors to form 3-star graphs:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: \( 1 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 47 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [47] and the unique 3-stars found are: 
<1, (2, 4, 7)>, <2, (1, 3, 4)>, <2, (1, 4, 5)>, <2, (3, 4, 5)>, <2, (3, 5, 9)>, <3, (2, 4, 7)>, <3, (2, 4, 5)>, <3, (2, 5, 9)>, <3, (4, 5, 7)>, <3, (4, 5, 9)>, <4, (1, 2, 5)>, <4, (1, 5, 7)>, <4, (2, 3, 7)>, <4, (2, 3, 5)>, <4, (2, 5, 9)>, <5, (2, 4, 9)>, <5, (3, 4, 7)>, <5, (3, 4, 9)>, <5, (3, 5, 9)>, <7, (1, 3, 4)>
