Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 1, 4, 6
- Node 1: 0, 7, 8
- Node 2: 9
- Node 3: 5, 8, 9
- Node 4: 0, 6
- Node 5: 3, 8
- Node 6: 0, 4
- Node 7: 1, 9
- Node 8: 1, 3, 5
- Node 9: 2, 3, 7

Now, letâ€™s calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:

- Node 0: \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 1: \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 6.
The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (1, 4, 6)>, <1, (0, 7, 8)>, <3, (5, 8, 9)>, <7, (1, 9, 7)>, <8, (1, 3, 5)>, <9, (2, 3, 7)>.

Therefore, the answer is [6].
