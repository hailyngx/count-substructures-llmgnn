Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 6) (2, 6) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {6}
- Node 1: Neighbors {6}
- Node 2: Neighbors {6}
- Node 3: Neighbors {4}
- Node 4: Neighbors {3, 7, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {6, 8}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 1, 2, 5}
- Node 7: Neighbors {4, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {5, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {4, 7, 8}

Next, let's count the number of 3-stars:
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars: \( [4 + 1] = 5 \)

The unique 3-stars are:
- <6, (0, 1, 2)>
- <6, (0, 1, 5)>
- <6, (0, 2, 5)>
- <6, (1, 2, 5)>
- <9, (4, 7, 8)>
