Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's first find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {3, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 1: No edges connected, so no neighbors
- Node 2: {5}
- Node 3: {0, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {0}
- Node 5: {2, 8}
- Node 6: {7, 8}
- Node 7: {0, 3, 6, 8}
- Node 8: {0, 3, 5, 6}
- Node 9: {3}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [4 + 4 + 4] = [12] \).

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <0, (3, 7, 8)>, <3, (0, 7, 8)>, <8, (0, 3, 5)>.
