Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 9) (6, 2) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 4, 7
- Node 1: 3, 8
- Node 2: 0, 6, 8, 9
- Node 3: 0, 1, 9
- Node 4: 0, 9
- Node 5: No neighbors listed
- Node 6: 2
- Node 7: 0
- Node 8: 1, 2
- Node 9: 2, 3, 4

Next, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors and see if they form 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors => [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
    - <0, (2, 3, 4)>
    - <0, (2, 3, 7)>
    - <0, (3, 4, 7)>
    - <0, (2, 4, 7)>
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors => [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
    - <2, (0, 6, 8)>
    - <2, (0, 8, 9)>
    - <2, (6, 8, 9)>
    - <2, (0, 8, 9)>
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors => 1 3-star
    - <3, (0, 1, 9)>
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors => 1 3-star
    - <9, (2, 3, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4 + 4 + 1 + 1] = [10].
The unique 3-stars found are: 
- <0, (2, 3, 4)>
- <0, (2, 3, 7)>
- <0, (3, 4, 7)>
- <0, (2, 4, 7)>
- <2, (0, 6, 8)>
- <2, (0, 8, 9)>
- <2, (6, 8, 9)>
- <3, (0, 1, 9)>
- <9, (2, 3, 4)>
