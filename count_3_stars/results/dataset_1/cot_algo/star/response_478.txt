Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {2, 4, 7}
- Node 1: Neighbors {5, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 4}
- Node 3: Neighbors {5, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 2, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 3}
- Node 6: Neighbors {7}
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 6}
- Node 8: Neighbors {3, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {1, 4, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 1 neighbor, so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars: [2]

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (2, 4, 7)>
<4, (0, 2, 9)>
