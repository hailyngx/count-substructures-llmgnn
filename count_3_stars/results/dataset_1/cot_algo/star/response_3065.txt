Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 6, 7
- Node 1: 0, 8
- Node 2: 4, 6, 9
- Node 3: 0, 7
- Node 4: 2, 6, 8, 9
- Node 5: 7, 9
- Node 6: 0, 2, 4, 9
- Node 7: 0, 3, 5, 8, 9
- Node 8: 1, 4, 7
- Node 9: 2, 4, 5, 6, 7

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

The total number of 3-stars is 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 33, so we have [33].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<2, (4, 6, 9)>
<4, (2, 6, 8)>
<6, (0, 2, 4)>
<7, (0, 3, 8)>
<9, (2, 5, 6)>
