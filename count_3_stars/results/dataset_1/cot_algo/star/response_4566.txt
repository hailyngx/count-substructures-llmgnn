Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 1, 6, 8
- Node 1: 0, 2, 5
- Node 2: 1, 7
- Node 3: 4, 9
- Node 4: 3, 7
- Node 5: 1, 6, 7
- Node 6: 0, 5
- Node 7: 2, 4, 5
- Node 8: 0
- Node 9: 3

Next, let's identify which nodes can form 3-stars:

- Node 0, 1, 5, and 7 have 3 or more neighbors and can form 3-stars.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- For Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [4], and the unique 3-stars are:

- <0, (1, 6, 8)>
- <1, (0, 2, 5)>
- <5, (1, 6, 7)>
- <7, (2, 4, 5)>
