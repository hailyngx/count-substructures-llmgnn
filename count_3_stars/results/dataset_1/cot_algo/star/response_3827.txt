Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: 3, 5, 9
Node 1: 2
Node 2: 1, 3, 4, 6, 9
Node 3: 0, 2, 5, 8
Node 4: 2, 6, 7, 8
Node 5: 0, 3, 6
Node 6: 2, 4, 5, 9
Node 7: 4
Node 8: 3, 4, 9
Node 9: 0, 2, 6, 8

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars around them:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars is 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 30, which will be shown as [30].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:

<2, (1, 3, 4)>
<2, (1, 3, 6)>
<2, (1, 4, 6)>
<2, (3, 4, 6)>
<2, (3, 6, 9)>
<3, (0, 5, 6)>
<4, (2, 6, 9)>
<(8, 4, 9)>
<9, (0, 6, 8)>

These are the unique 3-stars formed in the given graph.
