Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 34 edges, we will first find the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors (5, 6)
- Node 1: Neighbor (7)
- Node 2: Neighbors (3, 5, 8)
- Node 3: Neighbors (2, 4, 5, 9)
- Node 4: Neighbors (3, 6, 7)
- Node 5: Neighbors (0, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8)
- Node 6: Neighbors (0, 4, 5, 7)
- Node 7: Neighbors (1, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9)
- Node 8: Neighbors (2, 5, 7)
- Node 9: Neighbors (3, 7)

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has at least 3 neighbors:

- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars 
- Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 1 + 4 + 20 + 20 = 45, which will be enclosed in brackets: [45].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <2, 3, 5>
- <3, 4, 6>
- <3, 4, 7>
- <3, 5, 6>
- <3, 5, 7>
- <5, 6, 7>
- <7, 8, 9>

These 3-stars are listed inside angle brackets <> each only once.
