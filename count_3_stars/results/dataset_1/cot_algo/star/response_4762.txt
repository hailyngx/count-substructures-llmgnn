Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 2, 5, 7, 9
- Node 1: 7, 8
- Node 2: 0, 5
- Node 3: 6, 8, 9
- Node 5: 0, 2, 8
- Node 6: 3, 8
- Node 7: 0, 1
- Node 8: 1, 3, 5, 6, 9
- Node 9: 0, 3, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- The total number of 3-stars is 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 16, which we will put inside brackets: [16].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
- <0, (2, 5, 7)>
- <0, (2, 5, 9)>
- <0, (2, 7, 9)>
- <0, (5, 7, 9)>
- <3, (6, 8, 9)>
- <5, (0, 2, 8)>
- <8, (1, 6, 9)>
- <8, (3, 5, 6)>
- <8, (3, 5, 9)>
- <8, (3, 6, 9)>
- <8, (5, 6, 9)>
- <9, (0, 3, 8)>
- <9, (3, 8, 5)>
- <9, (3, 8, 6)>
- <9, (8, 5, 6)>
- <9, (8, 6, 3)>
