Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 8) (7, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 1: 2, 4, 7, 9
- Node 2: 1, 3, 4, 9
- Node 3: 2
- Node 4: 1, 2, 9
- Node 5: 8
- Node 7: 1
- Node 8: 5, 9
- Node 9: 1, 2, 4, 8

Next, we will check for each node that has three or more neighbors to see if it forms a 3-star:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [4 + 4 + 1 + 4] = [13] \).

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <1, 2, 4, 9>
