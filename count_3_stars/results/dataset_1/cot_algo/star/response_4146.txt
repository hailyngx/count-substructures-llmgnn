Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1 neighbor (4)
- Node 1: 2 neighbors (4, 7)
- Node 2: 3 neighbors (4, 5, 9)
- Node 3: 2 neighbors (4, 5)
- Node 4: 7 neighbors (0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8)
- Node 5: 5 neighbors (2, 3, 7, 8, 9)
- Node 6: 2 neighbors (4, 9)
- Node 7: 4 neighbors (1, 4, 5, 9)
- Node 8: 3 neighbors (4, 5, 9)
- Node 9: 5 neighbors (2, 5, 6, 7, 8)

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:
- Node 2, 4, 5, and 9 have 3 or more neighbors, so we need to calculate combinations:
  - Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  - Node 4: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars
  - Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  - Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 35 + 10 + 10 = 56

Summary:
[56]
Unique 3-stars:
<2, (4, 7, 8)>
<4, (1, 6, 8)>
<5, (2, 7, 8)>
<9, (2, 5, 7)>
