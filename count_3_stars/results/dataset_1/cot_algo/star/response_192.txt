Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 4, 7, 9
- Node 1: 0, 2, 4
- Node 2: 1, 5, 8
- Node 3: 0, 7, 8, 9
- Node 4: 0, 1, 6
- Node 5: 2, 9
- Node 6: 4, 7
- Node 7: 0, 3, 6, 9
- Node 8: 2, 3
- Node 9: 0, 3, 5, 7

Now, let's check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors to form 3-stars:
- Node 0 and Node 3 have exactly 4 neighbors each.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors as well.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- \( \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} = 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 16 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [16], and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 4, 7)>
<3, (0, 7, 9)>
<7, (0, 3, 9)>
<9, (0, 3, 7)>
