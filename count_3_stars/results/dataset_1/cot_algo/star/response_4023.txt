Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 2, 3, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors {1, 6, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 6}
- Node 5: Neighbors {6, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors {2, 3, 5, 7}
- Node 7: Neighbors {6}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 2, 5}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors {0, 2, 3}: <1, (0, 2, 3)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with neighbors {1, 6, 9}: <2, (1, 6, 9)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with neighbors {2, 3, 5}: <6, (2, 3, 5)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with neighbors {0, 2, 5}: <9, (0, 2, 5)>

There are 4 unique 3-stars in total, so the final result is [4].
