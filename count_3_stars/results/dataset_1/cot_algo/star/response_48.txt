Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 9
- Node 1: 2, 8
- Node 2: 1, 5
- Node 3: 4
- Node 4: 3, 6, 8
- Node 5: 2
- Node 6: 4, 7
- Node 7: 6, 8
- Node 8: 1, 4, 7, 9
- Node 9: 0, 8

Now, we can identify the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 5, and 8: <1, (2, 5, 8)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 4, and 9: <8, (1, 4, 9)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 6, and 8: <4, (3, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [3].
