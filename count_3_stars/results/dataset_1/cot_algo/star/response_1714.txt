Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 1: Neighbor - 7
- Node 2: Neighbors - 4, 5, 6, 9
- Node 4: Neighbors - 2, 9
- Node 5: Neighbors - 2, 6, 9
- Node 6: Neighbors - 2, 5
- Node 7: Neighbor - 1
- Node 9: Neighbors - 2, 4, 5

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
Applying \( \binom{n}{3} \) to nodes 2 and 9, we get:
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding up these results gives a total of 5 3-stars in this graph. 

Thus, the final result is [5], and the unique 3-stars are: 
- <2, (4, 5, 9)>
- <2, (5, 6, 9)>
- <2, (4, 6, 9)>
- <2, (4, 5, 6)>
- <4, (2, 5, 9)>
