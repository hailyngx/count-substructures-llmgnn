Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 7 (degree 3)
- Node 1: 0, 7, 8, 9 (degree 4)
- Node 2: 7 (degree 1)
- Node 3: 6, 8 (degree 2)
- Node 4: 0, 7, 8 (degree 3)
- Node 5: 8 (degree 1)
- Node 6: 3 (degree 1)
- Node 7: 0, 1, 2, 4 (degree 4)
- Node 8: 1, 3, 4, 5, 9 (degree 5)
- Node 9: 1, 8 (degree 2)

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with neighbors 1, 4, 7
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors 7, 8, 9
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with neighbors 0, 7, 8
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with neighbors 0, 1, 4
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with neighbors 1, 4, 9

Thus, we have a total of 5 unique 3-stars:
- <0, (1, 4, 7)>
- <1, (7, 8, 9)>
- <4, (0, 7, 8)>
- <7, (0, 1, 4)>
- <8, (1, 4, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [5].
