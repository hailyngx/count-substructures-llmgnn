Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 3, 6, 8
- Node 1: 2, 7
- Node 2: 1, 3, 5, 9
- Node 3: 0, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 4: 7
- Node 5: 2, 3, 7
- Node 6: 0, 3, 9
- Node 7: 1, 3, 4, 5
- Node 8: 0, 3
- Node 9: 2, 3, 6

Next, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 3 has 7 neighbors: inom{7}{3} = 35
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: inom{4}{3} = 4

Combining these, there are a total of [35 + 4 = 39] 3-stars in the graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<3, (0, 2, 6)>
<3, (0, 2, 7)>
<3, (0, 5, 6)>
<3, (0, 5, 7)>
<3, (2, 5, 6)>
<3, (2, 5, 7)>
<6, (0, 3, 9)>
<7, (1, 3, 4)>
