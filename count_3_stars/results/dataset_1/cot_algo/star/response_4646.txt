Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
The neighbor sets for each node are as follows:
- Node 0 neighbors: {6}
- Node 1 neighbors: {6, 8, 9}
- Node 2 neighbors: {3}
- Node 3 neighbors: {2, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 4 neighbors: {8}
- Node 6 neighbors: {0, 1, 3, 7}
- Node 7 neighbors: {3, 6, 8}
- Node 8 neighbors: {1, 3, 4, 7}
- Node 9 neighbors: {1}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with leaves 8, 9
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with leaves 6, 7, 8

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [2], and the unique 3-stars found are: <1, (8, 9)> and <3, (6, 7, 8)>.
