Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 7, 8
- Node 1: 3
- Node 2: 4, 6
- Node 3: 1, 4, 7, 9
- Node 4: 2, 3, 6, 7
- Node 5: 7
- Node 6: 2, 4, 8
- Node 7: 0, 3, 4, 5, 8
- Node 8: 0, 6, 7, 9
- Node 9: 3, 8

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 0: Does not form any 3-star.
- Node 1: Does not form any 3-star.
- Node 2: Forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3: Forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4: Forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5: Does not form any 3-star.
- Node 6: Forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7: Forms 3 3-stars.
- Node 8: Forms 1 3-star.
- Node 9: Does not form any 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1+1+1+3+1] = [7].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<2, (4, 6, 8)>, <3, (4, 7, 8)>, <4, (3, 6, 7)>, <7, (0, 4, 8)>, <7, (3, 4, 5)>, <7, (3, 4, 8)>, <8, (0, 6, 7)>.
