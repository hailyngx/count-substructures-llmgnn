Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 2, 7, 8, 9
- Node 1: 9
- Node 2: 0, 4, 7, 8
- Node 3: 4, 7, 9
- Node 4: 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9
- Node 5: 4
- Node 6: 4
- Node 7: 0, 2, 3, 4
- Node 8: 0, 2
- Node 9: 0, 1, 3, 4

Now, let's determine the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: No 3-star can be formed as it has only 1 neighbor.
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (Only 1 3-star can be formed)
- Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 5: No 3-star can be formed as it has only 1 neighbor.
- Node 6: No 3-star can be formed as it has only 1 neighbor.
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: No 3-star can be formed as it has only 2 neighbors.
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 1 + 20 + 4 + 4 = 37

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is [37].

Unique 3-stars are:
