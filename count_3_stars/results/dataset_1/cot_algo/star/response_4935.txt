Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The neighbor sets for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: {3, 5}
- Node 1: {2, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {1}
- Node 3: {0, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {8}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 7, 8}
- Node 6: {9}
- Node 7: {1, 5, 9}
- Node 8: {3, 4, 5}
- Node 9: {1, 3, 6, 7}

Now, we need to identify the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, hence it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3, 5, and 9 also have 4 neighbors each, hence each contributes 4 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, thus it contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [4 + 4 + 4 + 1] = [13] \).

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are as follows: 
- <1, (2, 7, 9)>
- <3, (0, 8, 9)>
- <5, (0, 7, 8)>
- <9, (1, 3, 6)>
