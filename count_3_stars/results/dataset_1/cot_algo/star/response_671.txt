Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 5
- Node 1: 0, 2, 6, 9
- Node 2: 0, 1, 3, 8
- Node 3: 2, 9
- Node 4: 9
- Node 5: 0, 8, 9
- Node 6: 1
- Node 7: 8
- Node 8: 2, 5, 7, 9
- Node 9: 1, 3, 4, 5, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes (0, 2, 6): <1, (0, 2, 6)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes (0, 1, 8): <2, (0, 1, 8)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes (2, 5, 9): <8, (2, 5, 9)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes (1, 3, 8): <9, (1, 3, 8)>, <9, (1, 8, 9)>, <9, (3, 8, 9)>, <9, (4, 8, 9)>, <9, (5, 8, 9)>

Counting the total number of unique 3-stars gives us a total of [6].
