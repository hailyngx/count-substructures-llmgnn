Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 7, 8}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 6, 7}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 2, 6}
- Node 4: {9}
- Node 5: {9}
- Node 6: {2, 3}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 1}
- Node 9: {1, 4, 5, 7}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up: 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [17]. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 7, 8)>, <1, (2, 8, 9)>, <2, (1, 6, 7)>, <3, (0, 2, 6)>, <9, (4, 5, 7)>
