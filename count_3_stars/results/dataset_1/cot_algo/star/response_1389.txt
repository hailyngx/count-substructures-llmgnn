Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 2) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 1: 8, 9
- Node 2: 6
- Node 3: 4, 9
- Node 4: 3, 8, 9
- Node 5: 9
- Node 6: 2
- Node 8: 1, 4, 9
- Node 9: 1, 3, 4, 5, 8

Now, we'll identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 4 and Node 9 have three or more neighbors.

For Node 4:
\[
\binom{3}{3} = 1 \text{ 3-star}
\]
The 3-star for Node 4 is <4, (3, 8, 9)>

For Node 9:
\[
\binom{5}{3} = 10 \text{ 3-stars}
\]
The 3-stars for Node 9 are <9, (1, 3, 4)>, <9, (1, 4, 8)>, <9, (1, 4, 9)>, <9, (1, 8, 9)>, <9, (3, 4, 8)>, <9, (3, 4, 9)>, <9, (3, 8, 9)>, <9, (4, 8, 9)>, <9, (1, 3, 8)>, <9, (1, 3, 9)>

Counting all 3-stars formed, we get a total of [1 + 10 = 11].
