Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {3}
- Node 1: {4, 5, 8}
- Node 2: {4, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 8}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 5, 7}
- Node 5: {1, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {2, 7}
- Node 7: {2, 4, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 3}
- Node 9: {2, 5, 7}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

For Node 2: Since it has 5 neighbors ({4, 6, 7, 8, 9}), we can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars. These are:
<2, (4, 6, 7)>, <2, (4, 6, 8)>, <2, (4, 6, 9)>, <2, (4, 7, 8)>, <2, (4, 7, 9)>, <2, (4, 8, 9)>, <2, (6, 7, 8)>, <2, (6, 7, 9)>, <2, (6, 8, 9)>, <2, (7, 8, 9)>

For Node 4: Since it has 4 neighbors ({1, 2, 5, 7}), we can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars. These are:
<4, (1, 2, 5)>, <4, (1, 2, 7)>, <4, (1, 5, 7)>, <4, (2, 5, 7)>

For Node 5: Since it has 4 neighbors ({1, 4, 7, 9}), we can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars. These are:
<5, (1, 4, 7)>, <5, (1, 4, 9)>, <5, (1, 7, 9)>, <5, (4, 7, 9)>

Adding them up, we have a total of [10 + 4 + 4] = [18] 3-stars in the given graph.
