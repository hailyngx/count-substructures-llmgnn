Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 3, 4, 5
Node 1: 5
Node 2: 7, 8
Node 3: 0, 9
Node 4: 0, 5, 6, 7, 8
Node 5: 0, 1, 4, 6, 8
Node 6: 4, 5, 8
Node 7: 2, 4
Node 8: 2, 4, 5, 6
Node 9: 3

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:

Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1
Node 2: inom{2}{3} = 0
Node 3: inom{2}{3} = 0
Node 4: inom{5}{3} = 10
Node 5: inom{5}{3} = 10
Node 8: inom{4}{3} = 4

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 0 + 0 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 25

So, the total number of 3-stars is [25].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<4, (0, 5, 6)>
<5, (0, 4, 8)>
<8, (2, 4, 6)>
