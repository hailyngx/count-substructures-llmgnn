Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
The 3-star graph formations for this given graph are as follows:

1. [3]
2. [1]
3. []

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 4.

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 3, 6)>
<2, (0, 5, 6)>
<6, (0, 4, 5)>
<9, (1, 2, 7)>
