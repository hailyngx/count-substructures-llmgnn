Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 10 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 7) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 1: 3, 8
- Node 3: 1, 8
- Node 4: 7
- Node 6: 7
- Node 7: 4, 6
- Node 8: 1, 3

Now, we can see that the nodes 1, 3, and 8 have 2 neighbors each, which is not enough to form a 3-star. Therefore, we look at nodes 4, 6, and 7.

Node 4, 6, and 7 have 1, 1, and 2 neighbors, respectively, so they also cannot form a 3-star.

In this case, there are no 3-stars in the given graph, so the total number of 3-stars would be 0, which we represent as [0].
