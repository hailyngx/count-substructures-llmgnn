Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 8, 9
- Node 1: 3, 8
- Node 2: 6, 7
- Node 3: 1, 4, 8, 9
- Node 4: 3, 7, 9
- Node 5: 7, 8
- Node 6: 2
- Node 7: 2, 4, 5, 8
- Node 8: 0, 1, 3, 5, 7
- Node 9: 0, 3, 4

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, 3, 4, 7, and 8 have 3 or more neighbors.

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (3-stars: <3, (1, 4, 9)>, <3, (1, 7, 8)>, <3, (4, 7, 9)>, <3, (7, 8, 9)>)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (3-stars: <4, (3, 7, 9)>)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (3-stars: <7, (2, 4, 8)>, <7, (2, 5, 8)>, <7, (4, 5, 8)>, <7, (4, 8, 9)>)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) (3-stars: <8, (0, 1, 3)>, <8, (0, 3, 5)>, <8, (0, 5, 7)>, <8, (0, 7, 9)>, <8, (1, 3, 5)>, <8, (1, 5, 7)>, <8, (1, 7, 9)>, <8, (3, 5, 7)>, <8, (3, 7, 9)>, <8, (5, 7, 9)>)

Finally, sum up the total number of 3-stars:
Total = 0 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 19

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [19], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <3, (1, 4, 9)>
- <3, (1, 7, 8)>
- <3, (4, 7, 9)>
- <3, (7, 8, 9)>
- <4, (3, 7, 9)>
- <7, (2, 4, 8)>
- <7, (2, 5, 8)>
- <7, (4, 5, 8)>
- <7, (4, 8, 9)>
- <8, (0, 1, 3)>
- <8, (0, 3, 5)>
- <8, (0, 5, 7)>
- <8, (0, 7, 9)>
- <8, (1, 3, 5)>
- <8, (1, 5, 7)>
- <8, (1, 7, 9)>
- <8, (3, 5, 7)>
- <8, (3, 7, 9)>
- <8, (5, 7, 9)>
