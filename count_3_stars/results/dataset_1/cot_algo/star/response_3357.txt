Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The neighbor sets for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: {1, 7, 8}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 4}
- Node 2: {4, 7}
- Node 3: {1, 4, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 3, 7, 8}
- Node 5: {7}
- Node 6: {9}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 4}
- Node 9: {3, 6, 7}

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 1: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 4: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 7: [inom{5}{3}] = 10

Total number of 3-stars: [1 + 1 + 10 + 10] = 22

Unique 3-stars:
- <0, (1, 7, 8)>
- <1, (0, 3, 4)>
- <4, (1, 2, 7)>
- <7, (2, 4, 5)>
- <7, (4, 8, 9)>
