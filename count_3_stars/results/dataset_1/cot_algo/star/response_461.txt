Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {3, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 1: {4, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {5, 6}
- Node 3: {0, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 6, 7}
- Node 5: {2, 6}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 4, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 3}
- Node 9: {1, 3, 6, 7}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star: <0, (3, 6, 7)>
- Node 1 forms 0 3-stars (has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 2 forms 0 3-stars (has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star: <3, (0, 8, 9)>
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star: <4, (1, 6, 7)>
- Node 5 forms 0 3-stars (has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 6 forms 3 3-stars: <6, (0, 2, 4)>, <6, (0, 5, 9)>, <6, (4, 5, 9)>
- Node 7 forms 0 3-stars (has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 8 forms 0 3-stars (has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star: <9, (3, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 7, so the final result is [7].
The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (3, 6, 7)>, <3, (0, 8, 9)>, <4, (1, 6, 7)>, <6, (0, 2, 4)>, <6, (0, 5, 9)>, <6, (4, 5, 9)>, <9, (3, 6, 7)>
