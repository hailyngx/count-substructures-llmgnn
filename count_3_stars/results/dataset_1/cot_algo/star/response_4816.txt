Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {4, 6}
- Node 1: {3, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 2: {4, 6}
- Node 3: {1, 4, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 8}
- Node 5: {1, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 8: {1, 4, 5}
- Node 9: {3, 5, 6}

Now, we can identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1, Node 4, Node 5, Node 6, and Node 8 have 4 neighbors.
- Node 3 and Node 9 have 3 neighbors.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- For the nodes with 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For the nodes with 3 neighbors: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \( [5] \)

Unique 3-stars: <1, (3, 4, 5)>, <4, (0, 1, 2)>, <5, (1, 6, 8)>, <6, (0, 4, 9)>, <8, (1, 4, 5)>
