Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 1: {3, 7}
- Node 2: {9}
- Node 3: {1, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {7}
- Node 5: {3, 8}
- Node 7: {1, 3, 4}
- Node 8: {3, 5, 9}
- Node 9: {2, 8}

Next, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars:

Nodes with 3 neighbors:
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with neighbors {1, 7, 8} <3, (1, 7, 8)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with neighbors {3, 5, 9} <8, (3, 5, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [2].
