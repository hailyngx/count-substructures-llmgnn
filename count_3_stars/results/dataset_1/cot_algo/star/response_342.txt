Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we can first determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6
- Node 1: 0, 3, 8, 9
- Node 2: 0, 5, 6
- Node 3: 0, 1, 7
- Node 5: 0, 2, 8
- Node 6: 0, 2, 9
- Node 7: 3
- Node 8: 1, 5, 9
- Node 9: 1, 6, 8

Now we can identify the nodes that have at least three neighbors:
- Node 0 with neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6
- Node 1 with neighbors: 0, 3, 8, 9
- Node 2 with neighbors: 0, 5, 6
- Node 8 with neighbors: 1, 5, 9
- Node 9 with neighbors: 1, 6, 8

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1] = [17] \).

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (1, 5, 6)>
- <0, (1, 5, 8)>
- <0, (1, 6, 8)>
- <0, (1, 6, 9)>
- <0, (5, 6, 8)>
- <0, (5, 6, 9)>
- <0, (5, 8, 9)>
- <1, (5, 8, 9)>
