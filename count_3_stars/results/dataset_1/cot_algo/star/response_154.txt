Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9
- Node 1: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8
- Node 2: 0, 1, 3, 4, 6
- Node 3: 0, 2, 7
- Node 4: 1, 2, 6, 8
- Node 6: 0, 1, 2, 4
- Node 7: 3, 8
- Node 8: 1, 4, 7, 9
- Node 9: 0, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 5 neighbors 
- Node 1: 5 neighbors
- Node 2: 5 neighbors
- Node 4: 4 neighbors
- Node 6: 4 neighbors
- Node 8: 4 neighbors

Next, we calculate the number of 3-stars for these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Since Node 4, 6, and 8 have 4 neighbors each, we have more than 3 neighbors, so we calculate the number of 3-stars for these nodes as well:
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 42 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [42].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (1, 2, 9)>
- <1, (0, 2, 6)>
- <2, (0, 1, 6)>
- <4, (1, 6, 8)>
- <6, (0, 1, 2)>
- <8, (1, 4, 9)>
