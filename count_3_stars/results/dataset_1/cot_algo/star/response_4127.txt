Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 4
- Node 1: 5, 9
- Node 2: 3, 9
- Node 3: 2, 5, 7, 8
- Node 4: 0, 7, 9
- Node 5: 1, 3, 8
- Node 6: 7, 8
- Node 7: 3, 4, 6, 8
- Node 8: 3, 5, 6, 7, 9
- Node 9: 1, 2, 4, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 0 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [17], and the unique 3-stars are:
<3, (2, 7, 8)>
<3, (5, 7, 8)>
<3, (7, 8, 9)>
<4, (0, 4, 7)>
<7, (3, 4, 8)>
<8, (3, 5, 8)>
<8, (6, 7, 8)>
<8, (7, 8, 9)>
<9, (1, 4, 9)>
