Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 24 edges, we can first identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: 1
- Node 1: 0, 2, 8
- Node 2: 1, 5, 8, 9
- Node 3: 6, 7
- Node 4: 7
- Node 5: 2, 7
- Node 6: 3, 9
- Node 7: 3, 4, 5, 9
- Node 8: 1, 2
- Node 9: 2, 6, 7

Next, we can identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 8, and 9: <1, (2, 8, 9)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 8, and 9: <2, (5, 8, 9)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 5, and 9: <7, (4, 5, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3] and the unique 3-stars found are <1, (2, 8, 9)>, <2, (5, 8, 9)>, and <7, (4, 5, 9)>.
