Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {2, 3}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 6}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 6, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 1}
- Node 4: {6, 7}
- Node 5: {8, 9}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {4, 6}
- Node 8: {2, 5, 6}
- Node 9: {5}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (2, 3, 6)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star: <2, (0, 1, 6)>
- Node 6 forms three 3-stars: <6, (1, 2, 4)>, <6, (1, 2, 7)>, <6, (1, 2, 8)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star: <8, (2, 5, 6)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is 6, so the answer is [6].
