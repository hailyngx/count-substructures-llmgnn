Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

Neighbors of node 0: 5
Neighbors of node 1: 6
Neighbors of node 2: 4, 7, 8
Neighbors of node 3: 4, 5, 9
Neighbors of node 4: 2, 3, 5
Neighbors of node 5: 0, 3, 4
Neighbors of node 6: 1, 9
Neighbors of node 7: 2, 8
Neighbors of node 8: 2, 7
Neighbors of node 9: 3, 6

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

Node 2 forms a 3-star with neighbors 4, 7, 8. <2, (4, 7, 8)>
Node 3 forms a 3-star with neighbors 4, 5, 9. <3, (4, 5, 9)>

There are a total of 2 3-stars in this graph, so the final answer is [2].
