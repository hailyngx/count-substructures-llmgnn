Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we start by listing the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: 6
- Node 1: 5, 7, 8
- Node 2: 4, 7, 8
- Node 3: 4, 6
- Node 4: 2, 3, 5
- Node 5: 1, 4, 6, 7
- Node 6: 0, 3, 5
- Node 7: 1, 2, 5
- Node 8: 1, 2

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars:

- Node 1: 3 neighbors (5, 7, 8) -> \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 2: 3 neighbors (4, 7, 8) -> \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 4: 3 neighbors (2, 3, 5) -> \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 5: 4 neighbors (1, 4, 6, 7) -> \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 7, which we will represent as [7].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<1, (5, 7, 8)>, 
<2, (4, 7, 8)>, 
<4, (2, 3, 5)>, 
<5, (1, 4, 6)>.
