Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1
- Node 1: 0, 2, 5, 6, 8
- Node 2: 1, 4, 5, 7
- Node 3: 5, 8, 9
- Node 4: 2, 7, 9
- Node 5: 1, 2, 3, 7
- Node 6: 1, 7, 8
- Node 7: 2, 4, 5, 6
- Node 8: 1, 3, 6, 9
- Node 9: 3, 4, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:
- Node 1: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 2: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 3: No 3-star
- Node 4: No 3-star
- Node 5: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 6: No 3-star
- Node 7: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 8: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 9: No 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 22 \)

Therefore, the final answer is [22] and the unique 3-stars are:
<1, (0, 2, 5)>
<1, (0, 2, 6)>
<1, (0, 5, 6)>
<1, (2, 5, 6)>
<1, (5, 6, 8)>
<2, (1, 5, 7)>
<2, (1, 6, 7)>
<2, (1, 5, 7)>
<2, (4, 5, 7)>
<2, (5, 6, 7)>
<2, (5, 7, 8)>
<5, (1, 3, 7)>
<5, (1, 6, 7)>
<5, (1, 7, 8)>
<5, (2, 3, 7)>
<5, (3, 7, 8)>
<7, (2, 4, 5)>
<7, (4, 5, 6)>
<7, (4, 5, 9)>
<7, (4, 6, 9)>
<8, (1, 3, 8)>
<8, (1, 6, 8)>
