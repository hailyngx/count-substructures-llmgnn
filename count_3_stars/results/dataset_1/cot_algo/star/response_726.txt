Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 6) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {3, 4}
- Node 1: Neighbor {6}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 7}
- Node 5: Neighbor {9}
- Node 6: Neighbor {1}
- Node 7: Neighbors {4, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbor {7}
- Node 9: Neighbors {3, 5}

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Nodes 0, 3, 4, 7, and 9 have three or more neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
Nodes 0, 3, 4, 7, and 9 can each form a 3-star. So, the total number of 3-stars is 5.

Finally, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<0, (3, 4)>
<3, (0, 9)>
<4, (0, 7)>
<7, (4, 8)>
<9, (3, 5)>

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
