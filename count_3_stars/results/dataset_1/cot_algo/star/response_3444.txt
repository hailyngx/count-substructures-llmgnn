Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's create a visual representation of the graph:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (0, 6), (1, 8), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 9), (3, 2), (4, 5), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 8), (6, 0), (6, 8), (7, 9), (8, 1), (8, 5), (8, 6), (9, 2), (9, 7)

Now, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {6}
- Node 1: Neighbors {8}
- Node 2: Neighbors {3, 5, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {2}
- Node 4: Neighbors {5}
- Node 5: Neighbors {2, 4, 8}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors {9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 5, 6}
- Node 9: Neighbors {2, 7}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [3].

The unique 3-stars are:
<2, (3, 5, 9)>
<5, (2, 4, 8)>
<8, (1, 5, 6)>
