Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 2) (5, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 20 edges, we will identify the 3-stars present in the graph:

Node 0 has neighbors: 5, 7, 8
Node 1 has neighbors: 3, 9
Node 2 has neighbors: 4, 6
Node 3 has neighbors: 1, 7
Node 4 has neighbors: 2
Node 5 has neighbors: 0
Node 6 has neighbors: 2, 8
Node 7 has neighbors: 0, 3
Node 8 has neighbors: 0, 6, 9
Node 9 has neighbors: 1, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

For Node 0:
- Node 0 forms the 3-star <0, (5, 7, 8)>

For Node 8:
- Node 8 forms the 3-star <8, (0, 6, 9)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
