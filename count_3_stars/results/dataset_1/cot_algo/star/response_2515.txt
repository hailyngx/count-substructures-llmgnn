Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's build the adjacency list for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {1, 2, 5, 7}
- Node 1: {0, 4, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {0}
- Node 3: {5, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 5: {0, 3, 6}
- Node 6: {1, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 4, 9}
- Node 8: {1, 4}
- Node 9: {1, 3, 6, 7}

Now, let's identify the 3-star graphs:

- Node 0 forms 1 3-star: <0, (1, 5, 7)>
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star: <1, (4, 6, 8)>
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star: <4, (6, 7, 8)>
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star: <6, (4, 5, 9)>
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star: <9, (3, 6, 7)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is [5].
