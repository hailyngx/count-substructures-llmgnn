Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: Neighbor(4)
- Node 1: Neighbors(2, 3, 8)
- Node 2: Neighbor(1)
- Node 3: Neighbors(1, 5, 6)
- Node 4: Neighbor(0)
- Node 5: Neighbors(3, 7)
- Node 6: Neighbors(3, 7, 8, 9)
- Node 7: Neighbors(5, 6, 9)
- Node 8: Neighbors(1, 6)
- Node 9: Neighbors(6, 7)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star formed
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star formed
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star formed
- Node 8: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars formed

Adding these up: 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 0 = 7

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7], and the unique 3-star configurations are:
<1, (2, 3, 8)>, <3, (1, 6, 7)>, <6, (3, 7, 9)>, <6, (3, 7, 8)>, <6, (7, 8, 9)>, <7, (5, 6, 9)>, <7, (6, 8, 9)>
