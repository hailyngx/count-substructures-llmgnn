Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0 neighbors: 1, 3
- Node 1 neighbors: 0, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
- Node 2 neighbors: 4, 9
- Node 3 neighbors: 0, 5, 6, 8
- Node 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 5
- Node 5 neighbors: 1, 3, 4, 8
- Node 6 neighbors: 1, 3, 7, 8, 9
- Node 7 neighbors: 1, 6, 9
- Node 8 neighbors: 1, 3, 5, 6
- Node 9 neighbors: 2, 6, 7

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \( [20 + 4 + 10 + 4] = 38 \)

The unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (4, 5, 6)>
- <1, (4, 5, 8)>
- <1, (4, 6, 7)>
- <1, (4, 6, 8)>
- <1, (5, 6, 8)>
- <3, (0, 5, 6)>
- <3, (0, 6, 8)>
- <6, (1, 3, 8)>
- <6, (1, 5, 8)>
- <6, (3, 5, 8)>
- <8, (1, 3, 5)>
