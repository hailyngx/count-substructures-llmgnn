Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 5, 6
- Node 1: 0, 5, 6
- Node 2: 6, 8
- Node 3: 0
- Node 4: 5, 8, 9
- Node 5: 0, 1, 4, 7, 9
- Node 6: 0, 1, 2, 7
- Node 7: 5, 6
- Node 8: 2, 4
- Node 9: 4, 5

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph.

Calculating \( \binom{n}{3} \) for nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 20 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [20].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (1, 5, 6)>
- <0, (1, 5, 4)>
- <0, (1, 5, 7)>
- <0, (1, 6, 7)>
- <1, (5, 4, 9)>
- <5, (4, 8, 9)>
- <6, (1, 2, 7)>
- <6, (0, 2, 7)>
- <6, (0, 1, 7)>
- <6, (0, 1, 2)>
