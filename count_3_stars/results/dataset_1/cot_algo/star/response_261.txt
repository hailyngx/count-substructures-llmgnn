Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the edges in the graph, we can determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {6, 9}
- Node 1: {2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 9}
- Node 3: {2, 5, 6}
- Node 4: {1, 5}
- Node 5: {3, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 7: {1, 9}
- Node 8: {1, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (2, 4, 5)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star: <6, (0, 5, 9)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star: <9, (0, 7, 8)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars gives us [3].
