Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9
- Node 1: 0, 3, 4, 6
- Node 2: 0, 4, 5, 8
- Node 3: 0, 1, 6, 7, 8
- Node 4: 1, 2, 6
- Node 5: 2, 7, 9
- Node 6: 0, 1, 3, 4, 8
- Node 7: 3, 5, 8
- Node 8: 2, 3, 6, 7
- Node 9: 0, 5

Now, let's identify nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 3, Node 6, and Node 8 have 5 neighbors
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 and Node 5 have 4 neighbors

For nodes with 3 or more neighbors, we will calculate the number of 3-stars they can form:

- Node 0 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 1 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

There are a total of \( 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 52 \) 3-stars in the graph.

Therefore, the final result is [52] and the unique 3-stars found are:

- <0, (1, 3, 6)>
- <0, (1, 3, 9)>
- <0, (1, 6, 8)>
- <0, (3, 6, 8)>
- <1, (0, 3, 6)>
- <1, (0, 3, 9)>
- <1, (3, 6, 8)>
- <2, (4, 5, 8)>
- <3, (0, 6, 8)>
- <4, (2, 5, 7)>
- <5, (2, 4, 7)>
- <6, (0, 1, 3)>
- <6, (0, 1, 4)>
- <6, (0, 3, 8)>
- <6, (1, 3, 8)>
- <7, (2, 5, 8)>
- <8, (1, 3, 6)>
- <8, (1, 3, 9)>
- <8, (3, 6, 9)>
- <9, (0, 1, 3)>
