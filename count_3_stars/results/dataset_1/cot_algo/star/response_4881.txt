Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 28 edges, let's first determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {3}
- Node 1: Neighbors {2, 3, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {1, 3, 6, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 1, 2, 6, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors {6, 7}
- Node 5: Neighbors {7}
- Node 6: Neighbors {2, 3, 4}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 4, 5}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 3}
- Node 9: Neighbors {1, 2}

Now, we can calculate the total number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with Node 1 as the center.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with Node 2 as the center.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with Node 3 as the center.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star with Node 6 as the center.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star with Node 7 as the center.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 26

Thus, the final answer is [26] and the unique 3-stars identified are:
- <1, (2, 3, 6)>
- <1, (2, 3, 9)>
- <1, (2, 7, 8)>
- <1, (2, 7, 9)>
- <2, (1, 3, 6)>
- <2, (1, 3, 9)>
- <2, (1, 7, 8)>
- <2, (1, 7, 9)>
- <3, (1, 2, 6)>
- <3, (1, 2, 7)>
- <3, (1, 2, 8)>
- <3, (1, 2, 9)>
- <6, (1, 2, 3)>
- <7, (1, 2, 3)>
