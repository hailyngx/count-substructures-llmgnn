Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 5, 7, 9
- Node 1: 2, 6
- Node 2: 1, 6, 8, 9
- Node 3: 4, 9
- Node 4: 3, 5, 7, 8
- Node 5: 0, 4, 8
- Node 6: 1, 2, 9
- Node 7: 0, 4, 8, 9
- Node 8: 2, 4, 5, 7, 9
- Node 9: 0, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 2: (1, 6, 9)
- Node 4: (3, 7, 8)
- Node 8: (5, 7, 9)

There are 3 unique 3-stars found: <2, (1, 6, 9)>, <4, (3, 7, 8)>, and <8, (5, 7, 9)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
