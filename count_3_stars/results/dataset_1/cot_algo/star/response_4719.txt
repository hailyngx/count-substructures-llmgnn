Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 3, 5, 6
- Node 1: 6, 8, 9
- Node 2: 8, 9
- Node 3: 0
- Node 4: 5
- Node 5: 0, 4
- Node 6: 0, 1, 8
- Node 7: 9
- Node 8: 1, 2, 6, 9
- Node 9: 1, 2, 7, 8

Next, we'll identify the 3-stars in the graph with the process described earlier:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with leaves 3, 5, 6: <0, (3, 5, 6)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with leaves 8, 9, 6: <1, (8, 9, 6)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with leaves 1, 9, 6: <8, (1, 9, 6)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with leaves 1, 8, 2: <9, (1, 8, 2)>

Combining these unique 3-stars, we find [4].
