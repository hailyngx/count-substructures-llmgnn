Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 18 edges, let's first determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 3, 4}
- Node 2: Neighbors {8}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 7}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 6}
- Node 5: Neighbors {6}
- Node 6: Neighbors {4, 5, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {3, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {2}
- Node 9: Neighbors {6, 7}

Next, we will check which nodes have three or more neighbors:

- Node 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, and 9 have three or more neighbors.

For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  - <1, (0, 3, 4)>
- Node 3: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  - <6, (4, 5, 9)>
- Node 7: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)

Therefore, there are a total of [2] 3-stars in the graph, which are <1, (0, 3, 4)> and <6, (4, 5, 9)>.
