Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3
- Node 1: 0, 2, 5, 6
- Node 2: 1, 3, 9
- Node 3: 0, 2, 5, 7
- Node 4: 7, 8
- Node 5: 1, 3
- Node 6: 1
- Node 7: 3, 4, 9
- Node 8: 4
- Node 9: 2, 7

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1 and its neighbors 0, 2, 5 form 1 3-star: <1, (0, 2, 5)>
- Node 2 and its neighbors 1, 3, 9 form 1 3-star: <2, (1, 3, 9)>
- Node 3 and its neighbors 0, 2, 5 form 1 3-star: <3, (0, 2, 5)>
- Node 7 and its neighbors 3, 4, 9 form 1 3-star: <7, (3, 4, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4, and we represent the unique 3-stars as <1, (0, 2, 5)>, <2, (1, 3, 9)>, <3, (0, 2, 5)>, and <7, (3, 4, 9)>.
