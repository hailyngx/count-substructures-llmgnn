Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 5, 6, 9 (neighbors: 1, 5, 6, 9)
- Node 1: 0, 7, 9 (neighbors: 0, 7, 9)
- Node 2: 6, 9 (neighbors: 6, 9)
- Node 3: 4, 5, 6 (neighbors: 4, 5, 6)
- Node 4: 3 (neighbor: 3)
- Node 5: 0, 3, 8, 9 (neighbors: 0, 3, 8, 9)
- Node 6: 0, 2, 3, 7 (neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 7)
- Node 7: 1, 6 (neighbors: 1, 6)
- Node 8: 5 (neighbor: 5)
- Node 9: 0, 1, 2, 5 (neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 5)

Now, we can identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with neighbors 1, 5, 6: <0, (1, 5, 6)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with neighbors 0, 3, 9: <5, (0, 3, 9)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with neighbors 0, 2, 7: <6, (0, 2, 7)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with neighbors 0, 1, 2: <9, (0, 1, 2)>

There are 4 unique 3-stars found in this graph, so the total number of 3-stars is [4].
