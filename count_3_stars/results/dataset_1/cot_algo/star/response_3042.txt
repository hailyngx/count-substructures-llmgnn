Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 3) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 4, 9
- Node 1: 4, 8
- Node 2: 3
- Node 3: 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9
- Node 4: 0, 1, 3
- Node 5: 3, 6
- Node 6: 3, 5, 9
- Node 7: 3
- Node 8: 1
- Node 9: 0, 3, 6

Now, let's check which nodes have three or more neighbors to form 3-stars:
- Node 3 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 21. 

The unique 3-stars are:
- <3, (2, 5, 6)>
- <3, (2, 5, 7)>
- <3, (2, 5, 9)>
- <3, (2, 6, 7)>
- <3, (2, 6, 9)>
- <3, (2, 7, 9)>
- <3, (5, 6, 7)>
- <3, (5, 6, 9)>
- <3, (5, 7, 9)>
- <3, (6, 7, 9)>
- <4, (0, 1, 3)>
