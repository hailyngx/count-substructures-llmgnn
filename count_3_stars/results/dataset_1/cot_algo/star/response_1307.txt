Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: 2, 7, 9
- Node 1: 3, 4
- Node 2: 0
- Node 3: 1, 8
- Node 4: 1, 5, 8
- Node 5: 4, 6, 7, 8
- Node 6: 5
- Node 7: 0, 5, 9
- Node 8: 3, 4, 5
- Node 9: 0, 7

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node that has 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.

Finally, sum up the total number of 3-stars: 1 (from Node 0) + 4 (from Node 5) = 5.

Therefore, there are a total of 5 3-stars formed in this graph. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 7, 9)>
<5, (4, 6, 7)>
<5, (4, 7, 8)>
<5, (6, 7, 8)>
<5, (4, 5, 8)>
