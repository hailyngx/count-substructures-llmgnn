Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 3, 5, 6, 8
- Node 1: 4
- Node 2: 4, 7, 9
- Node 3: 0, 6
- Node 4: 1, 2, 6, 8
- Node 5: 0, 9
- Node 6: 0, 3, 4, 7, 8
- Node 7: 2, 6
- Node 8: 0, 4, 6, 9
- Node 9: 2, 5, 8

Next, we'll identify the nodes with three or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 0: 4 neighbors, \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: 3 neighbors (exactly), 1 3-star
- Node 4: 4 neighbors, \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: 5 neighbors, \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: 4 neighbors, \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Calculating the total number of 3-stars, we have: \[ [4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4] = [23] \]

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
- <0, (3, 5, 6)>
- <0, (3, 6, 8)>
- <0, (5, 6, 8)>
- <0, (6, 8, 4)>
- <2, (4, 7, 9)>
- <4, (1, 2, 6)>
- <4, (2, 6, 8)>
- <4, (6, 8, 0)>
- <4, (8, 0, 6)>
- <6, (0, 3, 4)>
- <6, (0, 4, 8)>
- <6, (0, 8, 6)>
- <6, (4, 8, 0)>
- <6, (8, 0, 4)>
- <8, (0, 4, 6)>
- <8, (4, 6, 0)>
- <8, (6, 0, 4)>
- <8, (0, 6, 8)>
