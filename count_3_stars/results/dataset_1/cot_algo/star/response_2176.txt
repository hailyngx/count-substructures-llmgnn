Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) 

Response:
The graph can be visualized as follows:

```
   1 -- 2 -- 7 -- 8 -- 5
   |         |         |
   0 -- 4    6 -- 3    |
   |    |         |    |
   9    |         |    |
        -----------
```

Node 0 has the neighbors {1, 4, 6, 9}, node 1 has {0, 2, 3}, node 2 has {1, 6, 7}, node 3 has {1, 4, 6}, node 4 has {0, 3}, node 5 has {8}, node 6 has {0, 2, 3, 7}, node 7 has {2, 6, 8}, node 8 has {5, 7}, and node 9 has {0}.

We see that nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 6 have 3 or more neighbors, so we need to calculate the number of 3-stars they form.

For node 0, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) possible 3-stars.
For node 1, there are no 3-stars formed as it has exactly 3 neighbors.
For node 2, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) possible 3-star.
For node 3, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) possible 3-star.
For node 6, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) possible 3-stars.

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 10, which we represent as [10].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 3, 6)>, <0, (1, 2, 6)>, <0, (1, 2, 7)>, <0, (1, 3, 6)>, <0, (1, 3, 7)>, <1, (0, 2, 6)>, <1, (0, 3, 6)>, <1, (2, 6, 7)>, <2, (1, 6, 7)>, <3, (0, 1, 6)>.
