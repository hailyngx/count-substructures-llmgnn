Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, we first need to determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbor of nodes 4
- Node 1: Neighbor of nodes 8
- Node 2: Neighbors of nodes 4, 6
- Node 3: Neighbors of nodes 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 4: Neighbors of nodes 0, 2, 3, 7, 9
- Node 5: Neighbors of nodes 6, 7
- Node 6: Neighbors of nodes 2, 3, 5, 7
- Node 7: Neighbors of nodes 4, 5, 6, 8
- Node 8: Neighbors of nodes 1, 3, 7, 9
- Node 9: Neighbors of nodes 3, 4, 8

Now, we will check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors to form 3-stars:

- Node 3: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 4: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 6: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 7: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 8: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 9: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 27

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [27], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <3, (4, 8, 9)>
- <4, (3, 7, 9)>
- <4, (3, 9, 7)>
- <4, (7, 8, 9)>
- <4, (8, 7, 9)>
- <6, (3, 5, 7)>
- <6, (5, 3, 7)>
- <7, (3, 4, 9)>
- <7, (4, 3, 9)>
- <8, (3, 4, 7)>
- <8, (4, 3, 7)>
- <8, (4, 7, 9)>
- <8, (7, 4, 9)>
- <9, (3, 4, 8)>
