Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0: {2, 3, 7}
Node 1: {8}
Node 2: {0, 5, 6}
Node 3: {0, 5, 8}
Node 4: {9}
Node 5: {2, 3, 6, 9}
Node 6: {2, 5, 9}
Node 7: {0}
Node 8: {1, 3}
Node 9: {4, 5, 6}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

Node 0: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
Node 2: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
Node 3: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
Node 5: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
Node 6: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
Node 9: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 9

So, the final answer is [9], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 5, 7)>
<2, (0, 5, 6)>
<3, (0, 5, 8)>
<5, (2, 3, 6)>
<5, (2, 6, 9)>
<5, (3, 6, 9)>
<5, (3, 5, 9)>
<6, (2, 5, 9)>
<9, (5, 6, 9)>
