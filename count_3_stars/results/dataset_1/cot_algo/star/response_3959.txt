Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: 2, 3, 7, 9
- Node 1: 4, 5, 8
- Node 2: 0
- Node 3: 0, 6, 8
- Node 4: 1, 5
- Node 5: 1, 4, 7, 9
- Node 6: 3, 8
- Node 7: 0, 5, 9
- Node 8: 1, 3, 6
- Node 9: 0, 5, 7

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars: <0, (2, 3, 7)>, <0, (2, 3, 9)>, <0, (2, 7, 9)>, <0, (3, 7, 9)>
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <1, (4, 5, 8)>
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <3, (6, 8, 8)>
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars: <5, (1, 4, 7)>, <5, (1, 4, 9)>, <5, (1, 7, 9)>, <5, (4, 7, 9)>
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <8, (1, 3, 6)>
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <9, (0, 7, 5)>

Putting all the unique 3-stars together, we have:

[11]
<0, (2, 3, 7)>, <0, (2, 3, 9)>, <0, (2, 7, 9)>, <0, (3, 7, 9)>, <1, (4, 5, 8)>, <3, (6, 8, 8)>, <5, (1, 4, 7)>, <5, (1, 4, 9)>, <5, (1, 7, 9)>, <5, (4, 7, 9)>, <8, (1, 3, 6)>
