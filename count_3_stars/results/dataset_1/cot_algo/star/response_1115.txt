Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's create the neighbor sets for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {5, 6}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 5}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 6}
- Node 4: {1, 5}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 3, 5}
- Node 7: {5, 8}
- Node 8: {7}
- Node 9: {1}

Now, let's check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors to form 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \({6 \choose 3} = 20\) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \({6 \choose 3} = 20\) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \(20 + 20 = 40\):

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (2, 5, 6)>
<1, (3, 5, 6)>
<1, (4, 5, 6)>
<1, (5, 6, 9)>
<5, (0, 2, 6)>
<5, (0, 4, 6)>
<5, (2, 4, 7)>
<5, (2, 6, 7)> 

So, the final answer is [40].
