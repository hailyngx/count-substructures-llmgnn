Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9 (Degree: 6)
- Node 1: 0, 3, 4, 5, 8 (Degree: 5)
- Node 2: 5, 7 (Degree: 2)
- Node 3: 1, 8 (Degree: 2)
- Node 4: 0, 1, 9 (Degree: 3)
- Node 5: 0, 1, 2 (Degree: 3)
- Node 6: 0, 8 (Degree: 2)
- Node 7: 0, 2, 8 (Degree: 3)
- Node 8: 1, 3, 6, 7, 9 (Degree: 5)
- Node 9: 0, 4, 8 (Degree: 3)

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0, 3-stars: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 1, 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4, 3-stars: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5, 3-stars: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8, 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
The total number of 3-stars is therefore [20 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 10] = [42].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (1, 4, 5)>
- <1, (0, 4, 5)>
- <4, (0, 1, 9)>
- <5, (0, 1, 2)>
- <8, (1, 3, 9)>
