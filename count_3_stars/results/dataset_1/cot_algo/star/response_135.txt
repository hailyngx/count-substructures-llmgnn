Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3
- Node 1: 0, 5, 9
- Node 2: 9
- Node 3: 0, 9
- Node 4: 5
- Node 5: 1, 4, 6, 8
- Node 6: 5
- Node 8: 5
- Node 9: 1, 2, 3

Now we will count the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star. <1, (0, 5, 9)>
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. <5, (1, 4, 6)>, <5, (1, 8, 9)>, <5, (4, 6, 8)>, <5, (6, 8, 9)>
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star. <9, (1, 2, 3)>

The total number of 3-stars is 1 + 4 + 1 = 6, so the answer is [6].
