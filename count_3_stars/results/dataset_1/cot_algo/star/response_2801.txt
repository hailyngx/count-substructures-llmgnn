Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
With the given information, let's first find the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbor nodes = {5}
- Node 1: Neighbor nodes = {2, 3}
- Node 2: Neighbor nodes = {1, 4}
- Node 3: Neighbor nodes = {1, 5, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbor nodes = {2, 7}
- Node 5: Neighbor nodes = {0, 3}
- Node 6: Neighbor nodes = {8, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbor nodes = {4, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbor nodes = {3, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbor nodes = {6, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

- From the above neighbor sets, node 8 has 4 neighbors which is equal to the number of 3-stars it forms. So, it forms 4 unique 3-stars.
- Node 3 also has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 unique 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4+1] = [5].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <8, (3, 6, 7)>
- <8, (3, 6, 9)>
- <8, (3, 7, 9)>
- <8, (6, 7, 9)>
- <3, (1, 5, 8)>
