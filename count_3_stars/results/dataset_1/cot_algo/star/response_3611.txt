Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0 neighbors: 3, 6, 7, 8
- Node 1 neighbors: 4, 7
- Node 2 neighbors: 5, 6
- Node 3 neighbors: 0, 6
- Node 4 neighbors: 1, 5, 6
- Node 5 neighbors: 2, 4, 7, 8, 9
- Node 6 neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 4, 7
- Node 7 neighbors: 0, 1, 5, 6, 9
- Node 8 neighbors: 0, 5
- Node 9 neighbors: 5, 7

Next, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

- Nodes with 3 neighbors: None

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

- Nodes with 4 neighbors:
  - Node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4

- Nodes with 5 neighbors:
  - Node 5: inom{5}{3} = 10
  - Node 6: inom{5}{3} = 10
  - Node 7: inom{5}{3} = 10

Adding them up: 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 34

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [34].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 6, 7)>
<5, (2, 4, 7)>
<6, (0, 4, 7)>
<6, (2, 4, 7)>
<6, (3, 4, 7)>
<7, (0, 5, 9)>
<7, (1, 5, 9)>
<7, (2, 5, 9)>
