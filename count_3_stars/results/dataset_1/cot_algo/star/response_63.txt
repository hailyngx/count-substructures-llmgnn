Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 5}
- Node 1: {2, 6, 7}
- Node 2: {1, 6, 7}
- Node 3: {0, 5, 7}
- Node 5: {0, 3}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 8}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 3}
- Node 8: {6}

Now, we need to calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1, 2, and 7 have 3 or more neighbors, so we calculate \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star for each of them.

The total number of 3-stars is 3. 

Therefore, the final answer is [3]. 
The unique 3-stars are <1, (2, 6, 7)>.
