Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 4}
- Node 1: {2, 4}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 4, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 3: {7}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 2}
- Node 5: {9}
- Node 6: {2}
- Node 7: {2, 3, 9}
- Node 9: {2, 5, 7}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 0: No 3-star as it has only 2 neighbors.
- Node 1: No 3-star as it has only 2 neighbors.
- Node 2: inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars
- Node 3: No 3-star as it has only 1 neighbor.
- Node 4: No 3-star as it has only 3 neighbors.
- Node 5: No 3-star as it has only 1 neighbor.
- Node 6: No 3-star as it has only 1 neighbor.
- Node 7: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 9: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star

Adding up the number of 3-stars: [20 + 1 + 1] = 22

So, the unique 3-stars found are:
- <2, (0, 1, 4)>
- <7, (2, 3, 9)>
- <9, (2, 5, 7)>
