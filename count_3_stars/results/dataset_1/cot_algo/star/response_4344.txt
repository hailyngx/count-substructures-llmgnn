Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 9) (7, 1) (8, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 8
- Node 1: 0, 3, 7
- Node 2: 9
- Node 3: 1, 9
- Node 4: 0
- Node 5: 9
- Node 7: 1
- Node 8: 0
- Node 9: 2, 3, 5

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: forms 1 3-star
- Node 1: forms 1 3-star
- Node 9: forms 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: [3]

Unique 3-stars:
- <0, (1, 4, 8)>
- <1, (0, 3, 7)>
- <9, (2, 3, 5)>
