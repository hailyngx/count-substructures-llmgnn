Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 5, 7
- Node 2: 7, 8
- Node 3: 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 4: 6
- Node 5: 0, 3, 6, 9
- Node 6: 3, 4, 5
- Node 7: 0, 2, 3, 8
- Node 8: 2, 3, 7, 9
- Node 9: 3, 5, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 3 has 5 neighbors => \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors => \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors => \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 4 = 18

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [18].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<3, (5, 7, 8)>
<5, (0, 3, 6)>
<8, (2, 3, 7)>
