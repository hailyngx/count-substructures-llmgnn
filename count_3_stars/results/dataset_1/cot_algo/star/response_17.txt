Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's construct the neighbor sets for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {4, 6, 7}
- Node 1: {3, 4, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {3, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 5}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 6, 8}
- Node 5: {1, 3, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 4, 7}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 5, 6}
- Node 8: {4, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 5, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars each of these nodes can form:
- For Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 26 \), which we represent as [26].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <1, (3, 5, 9)>
- <4, (0, 6, 8)>
- <5, (1, 3, 7)>
- <7, (0, 5, 6)>
