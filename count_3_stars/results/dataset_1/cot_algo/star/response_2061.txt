Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) 

Response:
First, let's map out the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {5, 6}
- Node 1: {4, 8}
- Node 2: {3, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 3: {2, 5, 8}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 5: {0, 3}
- Node 6: {0, 4}
- Node 7: {2, 4, 8}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 3, 4, 7}

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
- Node 2 forms a 3-star: <2, (3, 7, 8)>
- Node 4 forms two 3-stars: 
  - <4, (1, 2, 8)>
  - <4, (2, 7, 8)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star: <8, (1, 3, 4)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars, we have [4].
