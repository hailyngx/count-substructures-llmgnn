Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 9) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 1, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9
Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 6
Node 2: 1, 3
Node 3: 0, 1, 2
Node 4: 9
Node 5: 8, 9
Node 6: 0, 1, 8
Node 7: 0, 9
Node 8: 0, 5, 6
Node 9: 0, 4, 5, 7

Now, we can see which nodes can form 3-stars:

Node 0: inom{6}{3} = 20
Node 6: inom{3}{3} = 1
Node 8: inom{2}{3} = 0
Node 9: inom{3}{3} = 1

Total number of 3-stars: [20 + 1 + 1 = 22]

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 6, 8)>
<6, (0, 1, 8)>
<9, (0, 5, 7)>
