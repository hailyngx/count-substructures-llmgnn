Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 1: {2, 3}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 7}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 4: {8}
- Node 5: {0, 3, 6}
- Node 6: {3, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 3, 6}
- Node 8: {4, 6}
- Node 9: {0}

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
- For node 0: Since it has 4 neighbors, the number of 3-stars = inom{4}{3} = 4. 
  Therefore, we have 4 unique 3-stars with node 0 as the center: <0, (3, 5, 7)>, <0, (3, 5, 9)>, <0, (3, 7, 9)>, <0, (5, 7, 9)>.
  
- No 3-stars can be formed with nodes 1, 4, 8, or 9 as they have less than 3 neighbors.

- For node 2: Since it has 3 neighbors, only 1 3-star is formed with node 2 as the center: <2, (1, 3, 7)>.

- For node 3: Since it has 6 neighbors, the number of 3-stars = inom{6}{3} = 20. 
  Therefore, we have 20 unique 3-stars with node 3 as the center. However, for brevity, we list only a few here: 
  <3, (0, 1, 2)>, <3, (0, 1, 5)>, <3, (0, 2, 5)>, <3, (0, 5, 6)>, <3, (1, 2, 5)>, <3, (1, 2, 7)>, <3, (2, 7, 6)>.

- No 3-stars can be formed with nodes 5, 6, 7 as they do not have 3 unique neighbors.

Putting the total number of 3-stars inside brackets, we have [25].
