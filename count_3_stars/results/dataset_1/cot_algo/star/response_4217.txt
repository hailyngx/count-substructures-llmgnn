Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 1: {3, 4, 6}
- Node 2: {0, 4}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 6, 7}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 2, 6}
- Node 5: {0, 7, 8}
- Node 6: {1, 3, 4}
- Node 7: {0, 3, 5, 8}
- Node 8: {0, 5, 7}

Next, let's identify nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 6 neighbors, forming inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, forming inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, forming inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, forming inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 32

Therefore, the final answer is [32] and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 4, 7)>
<0, (2, 5, 7)>
<0, (3, 4, 7)>
<0, (3, 5, 7)>
<0, (4, 5, 7)>
<3, (1, 4, 6)>
<3, (1, 4, 7)>
<3, (1, 6, 7)>
<4, (1, 2, 6)>
<4, (1, 2, 7)>
<4, (1, 6, 7)>
<7, (0, 5, 8)>
<7, (3, 5, 8)>
<7, (5, 8, 0)>
<7, (5, 8, 3)>
