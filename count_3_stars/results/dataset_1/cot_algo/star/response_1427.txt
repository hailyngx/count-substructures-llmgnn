Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: neighbors are 3 and 5
- Node 1: neighbors are 3 and 9
- Node 2: neighbors are 4, 5, 8, and 9
- Node 3: neighbors are 0, 1, 4
- Node 4: neighbors are 2, 3, 7, 8
- Node 5: neighbors are 0, 2, 6, 7, 9
- Node 6: neighbor is 5
- Node 7: neighbors are 4, 5, 6
- Node 8: neighbors are 2, 4
- Node 9: neighbors are 1, 2, 5

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars: <2, (4, 5, 8)>, <2, (4, 5, 9)>, <2, (4, 8, 9)>, <2, (5, 8, 9)>
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <3, (0, 1, 4)>
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars: <5, (0, 2, 7)>, <5, (0, 2, 9)>, <5, (0, 6, 7)>, <5, (0, 6, 9)>, <5, (2, 6, 7)>, <5, (2, 6, 9)>, <5, (2, 7, 9)>, <5, (6, 7, 9)>, <5, (7, 6, 9)>, <5, (2, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4 + 1 + 10] = [15].

The unique 3-stars found are: <2, (4, 5, 8)>, <2, (4, 5, 9)>, <2, (4, 8, 9)>, <2, (5, 8, 9)>, <3, (0, 1, 4)>, <5, (0, 2, 7)>, <5, (0, 2, 9)>, <5, (0, 6, 7)>, <5, (0, 6, 9)>, <5, (2, 6, 7)>, <5, (2, 6, 9)>, <5, (2, 7, 9)>, <5, (6, 7, 9)>, <5, (7, 6, 9)>, <5, (2, 7, 9)>
