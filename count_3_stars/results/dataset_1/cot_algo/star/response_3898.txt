Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

```
     1 -- 8     2
    /       \   /
   4 - 0 - 9 - 6
    \       /|  |
     7 -- 3 |  5
           \  /
            10
```

Where each number represents a node, and the edges are shown as connections between the nodes.

---

The neighbors for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: 2, 4, 7, 9
- Node 1: 4, 8, 9
- Node 2: 0, 3, 6, 9
- Node 3: 2, 6, 7, 8
- Node 4: 0, 1, 7
- Node 6: 2, 3, 9
- Node 7: 0, 3, 4, 8, 9
- Node 8: 1, 3, 7
- Node 9: 0, 1, 2, 6, 7

---

Next, we identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars associated with them.

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.

---

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 10] = 33 \).

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, 2, 4>
- <0, 2, 7>
- <0, 2, 9>
- <0, 4, 7>
- <2, 3, 6>
- <2, 3, 9>
- <3, 6, 7>
- <3, 7, 8>
- <7, 8, 9>
- <7, 9, 0>
- <7, 9, 1>
