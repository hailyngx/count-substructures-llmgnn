Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8 (6 neighbors)
- Node 1: 0, 2, 4 (3 neighbors)
- Node 2: 0, 1, 7, 8, 9 (5 neighbors)
- Node 3: 0, 4, 5, 6 (4 neighbors)
- Node 4: 1, 3, 6, 7 (4 neighbors)
- Node 5: 0, 3, 7, 8 (4 neighbors)
- Node 6: 0, 3, 4 (3 neighbors)
- Node 7: 2, 4, 5 (3 neighbors)
- Node 8: 0, 2, 5 (3 neighbors)
- Node 9: 2 (1 neighbor)

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0 has 6 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 42

Therefore, the final answer is [42] and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<0, (1, 2, 6)>
<0, (1, 2, 8)>
<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<0, (2, 3, 5)>
<0, (2, 3, 6)>
<0, (2, 3, 8)>
<2, (3, 4, 5)>
<2, (3, 4, 6)>
<2, (3, 4, 7)>
<3, (4, 6, 7)>
<3, (5, 6, 7)>
