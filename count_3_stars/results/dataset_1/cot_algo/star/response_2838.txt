Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {5, 8}
- Node 1: Neighbors {2}
- Node 2: Neighbors {1, 3, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {2, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbor {9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 3, 6, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors {3, 5, 7}
- Node 7: Neighbors {2, 6}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 2}
- Node 9: Neighbors {2, 3, 4, 5}

Based on the number of neighbors each node has, we can identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 0: Less than 3 neighbors
- Node 1: Less than 3 neighbors
- Node 2: Possible 3-star
- Node 3: Possible 3-star
- Node 4: Less than 3 neighbors
- Node 5: Possible 3-star
- Node 6: Possible 3-star
- Node 7: Less than 3 neighbors
- Node 8: Less than 3 neighbors
- Node 9: Possible 3-star

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
For nodes 2, 3, 5, 6, and 9, we will apply the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up: 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 23

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [23]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <2, (3, 5, 9)>
- <3, (2, 5, 6)>
- <5, (0, 3, 6)>
- <6, (3, 5, 7)>
- <9, (2, 3, 4)>
