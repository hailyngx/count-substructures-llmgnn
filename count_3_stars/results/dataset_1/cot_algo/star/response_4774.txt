Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 4) (8, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 2, 6
- Node 1: 3, 4, 8
- Node 2: 0, 4, 6
- Node 3: 1, 4, 5, 9
- Node 4: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7
- Node 5: 3, 4, 9
- Node 6: 0, 2, 4
- Node 7: 4
- Node 8: 1
- Node 9: 3, 5

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 1, 3: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 4: inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1 + 20 = 21].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <1, (3, 4, 8)>
- <4, (1, 2, 3)>
- <4, (1, 2, 5)>
- <4, (1, 2, 6)>
- <4, (1, 3, 5)>
- <4, (1, 3, 6)>
- <4, (1, 5, 6)>
- <4, (2, 3, 5)>
- <4, (2, 3, 6)>
- <4, (2, 5, 6)>
- <4, (3, 5, 6)>
- <4, (1, 3, 9)>
- <4, (5, 7, 9)>
- <4, (1, 3, 5)>
- <4, (1, 5, 7)>
- <4, (2, 3, 6)>
- <4, (2, 5, 7)>
- <4, (3, 6, 7)>
- <4, (1, 3, 9)>
- <4, (1, 5, 9)>
