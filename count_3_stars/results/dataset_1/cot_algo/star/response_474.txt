Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph has a total of 10 nodes and 28 edges. Let's analyze the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 6, 9} -> Forms 1 3-star
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 2, 3, 7, 9} -> Forms 1 3-star
- Node 2: Neighbor {1}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 4, 5, 8} -> Forms 1 3-star
- Node 4: Neighbor {3}
- Node 5: Neighbor {3}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 7} -> Forms 1 3-star
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 6, 9} -> Forms 1 3-star
- Node 8: Neighbor {3}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 1, 4, 5, 7} -> Forms 1 3-star

Therefore, we have a total of 5 3-stars in this graph, and the unique 3-stars are:
<[0, 1, 9], [1, 3, 7], [0, 6, 7], [1, 3, 9], [3, 4, 5]>.

So, the final answer is [5].
