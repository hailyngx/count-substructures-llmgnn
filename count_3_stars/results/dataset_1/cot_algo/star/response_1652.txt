Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8
- Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 9
- Node 2: 0, 1, 5, 8
- Node 3: 1, 5
- Node 4: 0, 9
- Node 5: 0, 2, 3
- Node 6: 7, 9
- Node 7: 0, 6, 8, 9
- Node 8: 0, 2, 7, 9
- Node 9: 1, 4, 6, 7, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0: has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1: has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2: has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5: has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 7: has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9: has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up: 
\[ [20 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10] = [43] \]

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (1, 2, 8)>
- <0, (1, 4, 9)>
- <0, (1, 7, 8)>
- <0, (2, 5, 8)>
- <1, (2, 5, 8)>
- <1, (3, 5, 9)>
- <7, (6, 9, 8)>
