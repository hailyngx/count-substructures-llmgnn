Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: (1, 9)
- Node 1: (0, 3, 6)
- Node 2: (4, 5, 6, 9)
- Node 3: (1, 8)
- Node 4: (2, 5, 9)
- Node 5: (2, 4, 7, 8, 9)
- Node 6: (1, 2)
- Node 7: (5)
- Node 8: (3, 5)
- Node 9: (0, 2, 4, 5)

Next, we determine the number of 3-stars each node can form:
- Node 1 and Node 5 have 3 neighbors, so they can each form 1 3-star.
- Node 2, Node 4, and Node 9 have 4 neighbors, so they can each form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
1 (from Node 1) + 1 (from Node 5) + 3 (from Node 2, Node 4, and Node 9) = 5

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [5].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (0, 3, 6)>
<5, (2, 4, 9)>
<2, (4, 5, 9)>
<4, (2, 5, 9)>
<9, (2, 4, 5)>
