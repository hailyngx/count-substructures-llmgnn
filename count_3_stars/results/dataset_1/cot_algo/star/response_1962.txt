Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 2) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {3, 8}
- Node 1: Neighbors {3, 6, 7}
- Node 2: Neighbors {4, 5, 7}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 1}
- Node 4: Neighbor {2}
- Node 5: Neighbor {2}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 2, 6}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 6}
- Node 9: Neighbor {6}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: [1 + 1 + 4 = 6]

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (3, 6, 7)>
<2, (4, 5, 7)>
<6, (1, 7, 8)>
<6, (1, 7, 9)>
<6, (2, 7, 9)>
<6, (2, 7, 8)>
