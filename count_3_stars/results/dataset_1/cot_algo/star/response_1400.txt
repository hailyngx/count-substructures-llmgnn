Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 2, 5, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 4}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 3, 6}
- Node 3: Neighbors {2, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 6}
- Node 6: Neighbors {2, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {3, 6}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 4, 6}

Now we will identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 0 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 1 + 4 + 1] = 7.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<2, (0, 3, 6)>
<6, (2, 5, 8)>
<6, (2, 5, 9)>
<6, (2, 8, 9)>
<6, (5, 8, 9)>
<9, (0, 4, 6)>
