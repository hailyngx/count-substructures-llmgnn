Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The neighbors for each node are as follows:

Node 0: {2, 3, 4, 7, 9}
Node 1: {4, 7}
Node 2: {0, 9}
Node 3: {0, 7, 9}
Node 4: {0, 1, 5, 6}
Node 5: {4, 8}
Node 6: {4}
Node 7: {0, 1, 3}
Node 8: {5, 9}
Node 9: {0, 2, 3, 8}

Now, we will identify the 3-stars in this graph:
Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes (2, 3, 9) in three different ways: 
- <0, (2, 3, 9)>
- <0, (3, 2, 9)>
- <0, (9, 2, 3)>

Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes (1, 5, 6):
- <4, (1, 5, 6)>

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get a total of [4].
