Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
The given graph has the following nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9.

Now, let's first find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 3, 8}
- Node 1: {9}
- Node 2: {0}
- Node 3: {0, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 4: {3}
- Node 5: {3, 9}
- Node 7: {3, 8}
- Node 8: {0, 7}
- Node 9: {1, 5}

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1 + 4 = 5].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
- <0, (2, 3, 8)>
- <3, (4, 5, 7)>
- <3, (5, 7, 8)>
- <3, (4, 7, 8)>
- <3, (4, 5, 8)>
