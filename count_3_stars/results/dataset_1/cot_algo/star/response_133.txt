Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The neighbors for each node are:

- Node 0: 1, 4, 5, 7, 9
- Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5
- Node 2: 1, 6
- Node 3: 1, 6, 9
- Node 4: 0, 1, 9
- Node 5: 0, 1
- Node 6: 2, 3, 8
- Node 7: 0, 8
- Node 8: 6, 7, 9
- Node 9: 0, 3, 4, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0 forms a 3-star with neighbors (1, 4, 5): <0, (1, 4, 5)>.
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors (0, 4, 5): <1, (0, 4, 5)>.
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with neighbors (1, 6, 9): <3, (1, 6, 9)>.
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with neighbors (0, 1, 9): <4, (0, 1, 9)>.
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with neighbors (6, 7, 9): <8, (6, 7, 9)>.
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with neighbors (0, 4, 8): <9, (0, 4, 8)>.

Therefore, we have a total of [6] 3-stars in this graph.
