Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's construct the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0 neighbors: 7, 8
- Node 1 neighbors: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9
- Node 2 neighbors: 5
- Node 3 neighbors: 1, 5
- Node 4 neighbors: 1, 6, 7
- Node 5 neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9
- Node 6 neighbors: 1, 4, 7, 9
- Node 7 neighbors: 0, 1, 4, 5, 6
- Node 8 neighbors: 0, 5, 9
- Node 9 neighbors: 1, 5, 6, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \( [20 + 20 + 10 + 4] = 54 \)
