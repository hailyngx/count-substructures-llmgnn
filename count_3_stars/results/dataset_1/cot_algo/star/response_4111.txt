Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given edges using a visual diagram:

```
    0 -- 7
    |       
1 -- 4     6 -- 9
| \ /     | /
|  *     *  
| / \     | \
|       5
| \     / |
|  *   *  |
| /     \ |
2 -- 5     8
| /       
3 -- 7 -- 8
```

Now, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {7}
- Node 1: {4, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {5, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {1, 7, 8}
- Node 5: {2, 3, 6, 8}
- Node 6: {1, 5, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 6}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors {4, 6, 7}.
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with neighbors {5, 7, 8}.
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with neighbors {5, 7, 8}.
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with neighbors {1, 7, 8}.
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with neighbors {2, 6, 8}.
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with neighbors {1, 5, 9}.
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with neighbors {1, 2, 4}.
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with neighbors {2, 4, 5}.

Counting all the 3-stars listed above gives us a total of 8 3-stars.

Therefore, the final answer is [8] and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (4, 6, 7)>
- <2, (5, 7, 8)>
- <3, (5, 7, 8)>
- <4, (1, 7, 8)>
- <5, (2, 6, 8)>
- <6, (1, 5, 9)>
- <7, (1, 2, 4)>
- <8, (2, 4, 5)>
