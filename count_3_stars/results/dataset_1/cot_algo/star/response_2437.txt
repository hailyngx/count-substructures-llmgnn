Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 4, 7
- Node 1: 0, 3, 7, 8, 9
- Node 2: 0, 3, 7, 8
- Node 3: 1, 2, 8, 9
- Node 4: 0, 6
- Node 6: 4
- Node 7: 0, 1, 2, 9
- Node 8: 1, 2, 3, 9
- Node 9: 1, 3, 7, 8

Next, let's calculate how many 3-stars each node can form:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Now, let's sum up the total number of 3-stars: 
\( 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 34 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [34], and the unique 3-stars found are: 
- <0, (1, 7, 4)>
- <1, (0, 8, 9)>
- <2, (0, 3, 8)>
- <3, (1, 9, 8)>
- <7, (0, 1, 9)>
- <8, (1, 2, 9)>
- <9, (1, 3, 7)>
