Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 26 edges, we first need to determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {4, 5, 8}
- Node 1: Neighbors {3, 5, 8}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbor {0}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 1, 6, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors {5, 7}
- Node 7: Neighbors {3, 6}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 1, 3, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {3, 5, 8}

Next, we calculate the number of 3-stars around each node that has 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0: 0 3-stars (has only 3 neighbors)
- Node 1: 1 3-star
- Node 3: 1 3-star
- Node 5: 1 3-star
- Node 8: 2 3-stars
- Node 9: 1 3-star

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: [1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1] = [6]

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<1, (3, 5, 8)>
<3, (1, 7, 8)>
<5, (0, 1, 6)>
<8, (0, 1, 9)>
<8, (3, 5, 9)>
<9, (5, 8, 3)>
