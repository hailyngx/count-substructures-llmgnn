Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
Based on the provided information, the 3-stars in this graph are as follows:
 
<1, (2, 4, 5)>
<2, (1, 4, 6)>
<3, (0, 4, 7)>
<4, (2, 5, 6)> 

There are a total of [4] 3-stars in this graph.
