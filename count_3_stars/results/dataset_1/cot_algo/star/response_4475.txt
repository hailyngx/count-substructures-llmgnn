Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {2}
- Node 1: {3, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 4}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 4: {2, 3}
- Node 5: {3}
- Node 6: {1, 9}
- Node 7: {1, 3}
- Node 9: {1, 6}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with its neighbors {6, 7, 9}. Its neighbor set has 4 elements, thus forming 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars. 
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with its neighbors {3, 4}. Its neighbor set has 3 elements, thus forming 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star. 
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with its neighbors {2, 4, 7}. Its neighbor set has 5 elements, thus forming 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with its neighbors {1, 9}. Its neighbor set has 2 elements. Thus, it does not form any 3-star.
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with its neighbors {1, 6}. Its neighbor set has 2 elements. Thus, it does not form any 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars in the graph: [4 + 1 + 10] = 15

Unique 3-stars found:
<1, 6, 7, 9>
<2, 3, 4, 7>
