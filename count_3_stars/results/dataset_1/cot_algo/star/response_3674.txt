Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list out the neighbors for each node:
Node 0: 3, 4, 8
Node 1: 4, 5, 6
Node 2: 3, 7
Node 3: 0, 2, 6, 9
Node 4: 0, 1
Node 5: 1
Node 6: 1, 3, 9
Node 7: 2, 9
Node 8: 0, 9
Node 9: 3, 6, 7, 8

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
Node 0: C(3,3) = 1
Node 1: C(3,3) = 1
Node 3: C(4,3) = 4
Node 6: C(3,3) = 1
Node 9: C(4,3) = 4

Total number of 3-stars: [1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4] = [11]

List of unique 3-stars:
<0, 3, 6>
<0, 3, 8>
<0, 4, 8>
<3, 6, 9>
<3, 7, 9>
<6, 1, 9>
<7, 2, 9>
<9, 8, 0>
<9, 8, 1>
<9, 8, 3>
<9, 8, 7>
