Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 4, 7, 8
- Node 1: 4, 5, 7
- Node 2: 0, 3, 7
- Node 3: 2, 9
- Node 4: 0, 1, 5, 8
- Node 5: 1, 4, 7, 8
- Node 7: 0, 1, 2, 5, 8, 9
- Node 8: 0, 4, 5, 7
- Node 9: 3, 7

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 2, 4, and 7: <0, (2, 4, 7)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 4, 5, and 7: <1, (4, 5, 7)>
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 3 has only 2 neighbors so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 0, 5, and 8: <4, (0, 5, 8)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 1, 4, and 8: <5, (1, 4, 8)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 0, 5, and 8: <7, (0, 5, 8)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 0, 4, and 7: <8, (0, 4, 7)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5] and the unique 3-stars are <0, (2, 4, 7)>, <1, (4, 5, 7)>, <4, (0, 5, 8)>, <5, (1, 4, 8)>, and <8, (0, 4, 7)>.
