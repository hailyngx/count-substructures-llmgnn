Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 1: neighbor of node 2
- Node 2: neighbors of nodes 1, 3, 4, 9
- Node 3: neighbors of nodes 2, 6, 7, 8
- Node 4: neighbors of nodes 2, 8
- Node 5: neighbors of nodes 6, 9
- Node 6: neighbors of nodes 3, 5
- Node 7: neighbor of node 3
- Node 8: neighbors of nodes 3, 4, 9
- Node 9: neighbors of nodes 2, 5, 8

Next, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 2: 4 neighbors
- Node 3: 4 neighbors
- Node 8: 3 neighbors
- Node 9: 3 neighbors

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars:

- For Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Overall, we have a total of \( [4 + 4 + 1 + 1] = [10] \) 3-stars in this graph.

List of unique 3-stars:
- <2, (1, 4, 9)>
- <2, (1, 3, 9)>
- <2, (4, 3, 9)>
- <2, (4, 9, 8)>
- <3, (2, 6, 7)>
- <3, (2, 7, 8)>
- <3, (6, 5, 9)>
- <3, (7, 8, 9)>
