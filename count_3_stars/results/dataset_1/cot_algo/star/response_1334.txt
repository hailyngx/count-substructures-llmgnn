Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Since we have the adjacency list of the graph, let's first find the neighbors of each node:

Node 0 neighbors: 1, 2, 9
Node 1 neighbors: 0, 8
Node 2 neighbors: 0, 3
Node 3 neighbors: 2, 4, 7
Node 4 neighbors: 3, 6, 9
Node 5 neighbors: 7, 8
Node 6 neighbors: 4, 9
Node 7 neighbors: 3, 5, 8
Node 8 neighbors: 1, 5, 7
Node 9 neighbors: 0, 4, 6

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

Node 0 has 3 neighbors -> [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
Node 3 has 3 neighbors -> [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
Node 4 has 3 neighbors -> [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
Node 7 has 3 neighbors -> [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
Node 8 has 3 neighbors -> [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
Node 9 has 3 neighbors -> [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star

There is a total of [1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1] = 6 3-stars.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 2, 9)>
<3, (2, 4, 7)>
<4, (3, 6, 9)>
<7, (3, 5, 8)>
<8, (1, 5, 7)>
<9, (0, 4, 6)>
