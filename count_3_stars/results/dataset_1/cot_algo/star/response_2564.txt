Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 4, 6}
- Node 1: {3, 4, 5}
- Node 2: {0, 8}
- Node 3: {1, 4, 6}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 3}
- Node 5: {1, 7}
- Node 6: {0, 3, 7}
- Node 7: {5, 6}
- Node 8: {2}

Now, let's calculate the 3-stars:
- Node 0: [\[ \binom{3}{3} = 1 \]] = 1
- Node 1: [\[ \binom{3}{3} = 1 \]] = 1
- Node 3: [\[ \binom{3}{3} = 1 \]] = 1
- Node 4: [\[ \binom{3}{3} = 1 \]] = 1
- Node 6: [\[ \binom{3}{3} = 1 \]] = 1

Adding them up, we have a total of 5 3-stars in this graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [5] with the unique 3-stars being:
<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<1, (3, 4, 5)>
<3, (1, 4, 6)>
<4, (0, 1, 3)>
<6, (0, 3, 7)>
