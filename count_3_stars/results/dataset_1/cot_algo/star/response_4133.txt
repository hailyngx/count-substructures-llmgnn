Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's construct the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {7, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {4, 6, 7}
- Node 2: {4, 7, 9}
- Node 3: {5}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 5, 8}
- Node 5: {3, 4}
- Node 6: {1}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 2}
- Node 8: {0, 4}
- Node 9: {0, 2}

Next, we'll identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors
- Node 1: 3 neighbors
- Node 2: 3 neighbors
- Node 4: 4 neighbors
- Node 7: 3 neighbors

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
\[ \text{Total 3-stars} = \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} = 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 8 \]

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (7, 8, 9)>, <1, (4, 6, 7)>, <2, (4, 7, 9)>, <4, (1, 2, 5)>, <4, (1, 2, 8)>, <4, (1, 5, 8)>, <7, (0, 1, 2)>, <7, (0, 1, 4)> 

So, the final answer is [8].
