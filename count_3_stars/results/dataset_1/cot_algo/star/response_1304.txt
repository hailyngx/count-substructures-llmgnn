Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {7, 8}
- Node 1: {5, 9}
- Node 2: {6}
- Node 3: {7}
- Node 4: {5, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 4}
- Node 6: {2}
- Node 7: {0, 3, 8}
- Node 8: {0, 7}
- Node 9: {1, 4}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

There is 1 3-star in the graph. So, the total number of 3-stars is [1] and the unique 3-star found is <7, (0, 8, 3)>.
