Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The neighbors of each node are as follows:

- Node 0: 5, 6
- Node 1: 2, 5, 9
- Node 2: 1, 3
- Node 3: 2
- Node 4: 5, 8, 9
- Node 5: 0, 1, 4
- Node 6: 0, 7
- Node 7: 6, 9
- Node 8: 4
- Node 9: 1, 4, 7

Now, let's identify the 3-stars.

Node 1 and Node 4 both have 3 neighbors, so they contribute to the count of 3-stars. 

The total number of 3-stars is [2].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (2, 5, 9)>
<4, (5, 8, 9)>
