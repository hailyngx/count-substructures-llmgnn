Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 6, 9
- Node 1: 0, 3, 5
- Node 2: 0, 7
- Node 3: 1, 7
- Node 4: 9
- Node 5: 1
- Node 6: 0
- Node 7: 2, 3, 8
- Node 8: 7, 9
- Node 9: 0, 4, 8

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding these up, we have a total of \( [4 + 1 + 1] = 6 \) 3-stars.

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (1, 2, 6)>
- <0, (1, 2, 9)>
- <0, (1, 6, 9)>
- <0, (2, 6, 9)>
- <7, (2, 3, 8)>
- <9, (4, 8, 9)>
