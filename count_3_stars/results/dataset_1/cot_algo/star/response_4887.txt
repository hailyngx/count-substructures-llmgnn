Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's create the neighbor sets for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {4}
- Node 1: {7}
- Node 2: {3, 4, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {2, 4, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 5: {4, 6}
- Node 6: {3, 4, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 3}
- Node 8: {2, 3, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {2, 6, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and find the 3-stars:
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. 
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars:
\( [10 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 10] = 60 \)

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
- <2, (3, 4, 8)>
- <3, (2, 4, 8)>
- <4, (2, 3, 6)>
- <4, (2, 3, 8)>
- <4, (2, 5, 6)>
- <4, (3, 5, 6)>
- <6, (2, 4, 8)>
- <8, (2, 3, 4)>
- <8, (2, 4, 6)>
- <8, (3, 4, 6)>
