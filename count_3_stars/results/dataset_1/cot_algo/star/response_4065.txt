Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will first list the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: 1, 2, 6, 7
Node 1: 0, 2, 5, 7, 8, 9
Node 2: 0, 1, 9
Node 3: 4, 7, 9
Node 4: 3, 9
Node 5: 1, 8, 9
Node 6: 0
Node 7: 0, 1, 3, 8
Node 8: 1, 5, 7
Node 9: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

Now, we will identify nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars formed by each:

Node 1: <1, (0, 5, 7)>, <1, (0, 8, 9)>, <1, (2, 5, 9)>, <1, (7, 8, 9)> (4 3-stars)
Node 2: <2, (0, 1, 9)>, <2, (1, 5, 9)>, <2, (3, 4, 9)> (3 3-stars)
Node 3: <3, (4, 7, 9)>, <3, (7, 8, 9)>, <3, (9, 4, 5)> (3 3-stars)
Node 5: <5, (1, 7, 8)>, <5, (1, 8, 9)>, <5, (9, 3, 4)> (3 3-stars)
Node 7: <7, (0, 1, 8)>, <7, (0, 3, 8)>, <7, (1, 3, 8)>, <7, (9, 1, 8)> (4 3-stars)
Node 9: <9, (1, 2, 3)>, <9, (1, 4, 5)>, <9, (3, 4, 7)>, <9, (5, 1, 8)> (4 3-stars)

Total number of 3-stars: [21] 

Unique 3-stars:
<1, (0, 5, 7)>
<1, (0, 8, 9)>
<1, (2, 5, 9)>
<1, (7, 8, 9)>
<2, (0, 1, 9)>
<2, (1, 5, 9)>
<2, (3, 4, 9)>
<3, (4, 7, 9)>
<3, (7, 8, 9)>
<3, (9, 4, 5)>
<5, (1, 7, 8)>
<5, (1, 8, 9)>
<5, (9, 3, 4)>
<7, (0, 1, 8)>
<7, (0, 3, 8)>
<7, (1, 3, 8)>
<7, (9, 1, 8)>
<9, (1, 2, 3)>
<9, (1, 4, 5)>
<9, (3, 4, 7)>
<9, (5, 1, 8)>
