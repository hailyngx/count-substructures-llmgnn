Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 4, 5, 8
- Node 1: 2, 4, 5, 8
- Node 2: 1, 8
- Node 3: 4, 5, 7, 8
- Node 4: 0, 1, 3
- Node 5: 0, 1, 3
- Node 6: 7
- Node 7: 3, 6
- Node 8: 0, 1, 2, 3

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 1, 3-star <1, (0, 4, 5)>
- Node 3, 3-star <3, (4, 0, 5)>, <3, (4, 1, 5)>, <3, (4, 0, 1)>
- Node 8, 3-star <8, (0, 1, 3)>, <8, (0, 4, 3)>, <8, (0, 5, 3)>, <8, (1, 4, 3)>, <8, (1, 5, 3)>, <8, (4, 0, 1)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
