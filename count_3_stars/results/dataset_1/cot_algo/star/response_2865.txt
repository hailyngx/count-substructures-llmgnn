Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's organize the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {2, 6, 8}
- Node 1: {2, 6, 7}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {4, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {3, 5}
- Node 5: {4, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 2, 3, 7}
- Node 7: {1, 3, 6}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 3, 5}
- Node 9: {2, 3, 5}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed around those nodes:

- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 36

Therefore, the final result is [36] and the unique 3-stars found are:

- <2, (0, 1, 8)>
- <2, (0, 6, 8)>
- <2, (1, 6, 8)>
- <2, (6, 8, 9)>
- <2, (6, 8, 9)>
- <3, (4, 5, 9)>
- <3, (4, 8, 9)>
- <3, (5, 8, 9)>
- <6, (0, 1, 7)>
- <6, (0, 3, 7)>
- <6, (1, 3, 7)>
- <6, (2, 7, 9)>
- <6, (3, 7, 9)>
- <8, (0, 5, 9)>
- <8, (2, 3, 5)>
