Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, we will identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1
- Node 1: 0, 3, 9
- Node 2: 4, 6
- Node 3: 1, 4, 5, 6
- Node 4: 2, 3
- Node 5: 3, 6, 7, 8
- Node 6: 2, 3, 5
- Node 7: 5, 8, 9
- Node 8: 5, 7
- Node 9: 1, 7

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each central node:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 4 + 4 + 1] = 10.

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (0, 3, 9)>
<3, (1, 4, 5)>
<5, (3, 6, 7)>
<5, (3, 6, 8)>
<5, (5, 7, 8)>
<7, (5, 8, 9)>
