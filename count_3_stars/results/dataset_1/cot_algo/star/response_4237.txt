Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 6) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 2) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors are 2, 4, 6
- Node 1: Neighbor is 3
- Node 2: Neighbors are 0, 8, 9
- Node 3: Neighbor is 1
- Node 4: Neighbors are 0, 6
- Node 6: Neighbors are 0, 4, 7
- Node 7: Neighbor is 6
- Node 8: Neighbor is 2
- Node 9: Neighbor is 2

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for nodes with 3 or more neighbors using \( \binom{n}{3} \):

Node 0: 3 neighbors, so \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 2: 3 neighbors, so \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 4: 2 neighbors, so no 3-star
Node 6: 3 neighbors, so \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: [3]

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (2, 4, 6)>
