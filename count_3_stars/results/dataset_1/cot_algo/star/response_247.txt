Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {4, 7}
- Node 1: {4, 5}
- Node 2: {3, 9}
- Node 3: {2}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 7}
- Node 5: {1, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 4}
- Node 9: {2, 5}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: inom(2, 3) = 0
- Node 1: inom(2, 3) = 0
- Node 2: inom(2, 3) = 0
- Node 4: inom(3, 3) = 1
- Node 5: inom(2, 3) = 0
- Node 7: inom(2, 3) = 0
- Node 9: inom(2, 3) = 0

So, there is only 1 unique 3-star in this graph:
- <4, (0, 1, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1].
