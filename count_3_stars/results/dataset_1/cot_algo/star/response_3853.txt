Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 6, 8, 9
- Node 1: 3, 5, 6, 7
- Node 2: 0, 5, 7
- Node 3: 1, 7, 9
- Node 4: 5, 8
- Node 5: 1, 2, 4
- Node 6: 0, 1
- Node 7: 1, 2, 3
- Node 8: 0, 4
- Node 9: 0, 3

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 4 neighbors
- Node 1: 4 neighbors
- Node 2: 3 neighbors
- Node 3: 3 neighbors
- Node 5: 3 neighbors
- Node 7: 3 neighbors

Next, calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

There are no 3-stars for nodes with less than 3 neighbors. 

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 = 8

Therefore, the final count of 3-stars is [8].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (2, 6, 8)>
- <0, (2, 6, 9)>
- <0, (2, 8, 9)>
- <1, (3, 5, 6)>
- <1, (3, 5, 7)>
- <1, (3, 6, 7)>
- <1, (5, 6, 7)>
- <0, (2, 8, 9)>
