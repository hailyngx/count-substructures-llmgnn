Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph by listing the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 5
- Node 1: 6
- Node 2: 4, 6, 8
- Node 3: 8
- Node 4: 2, 7
- Node 5: 0, 8
- Node 6: 1, 2
- Node 7: 4
- Node 8: 2, 3, 5

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 0: Does not have 3 or more neighbors
- Node 1: Does not have 3 or more neighbors
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: Does not have 3 or more neighbors
- Node 4: Does not have 3 or more neighbors
- Node 5: Does not have 3 or more neighbors
- Node 6: Does not have 3 or more neighbors
- Node 7: Does not have 3 or more neighbors
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: [2]

Unique 3-stars:
<2, (4, 6, 8)>
<8, (2, 3, 5)>
