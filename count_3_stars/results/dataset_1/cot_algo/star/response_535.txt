Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors = {2, 4}
- Node 1: Neighbors = {2, 3, 6, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors = {0, 1}
- Node 3: Neighbors = {1, 4, 7}
- Node 4: Neighbors = {0, 3}
- Node 6: Neighbors = {1, 7}
- Node 7: Neighbors = {3, 6}
- Node 8: Neighbors = {1}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 and Node 3 have 4 neighbors each, so we need to calculate the number of 3-stars around these nodes.
- For Node 1, there are 4 choose 3 = 4 ways to form a 3-star.
- For Node 3, there are 4 choose 3 = 4 ways to form a 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 = 8

Therefore, the final answer is [8] and the unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (2, 3, 6)>
- <1, (2, 3, 8)>
- <1, (2, 6, 8)>
- <1, (3, 6, 8)>
- <3, (1, 4, 7)>
