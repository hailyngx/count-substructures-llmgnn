Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 30 edges, we will first determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0 has neighbors: 2, 3, 9
- Node 1 has neighbors: 2, 3, 7, 9
- Node 2 has neighbors: 0, 1, 5, 7
- Node 3 has neighbors: 0, 1, 6
- Node 4 has neighbors: 8, 9
- Node 5 has neighbors: 2, 6
- Node 6 has neighbors: 3, 5, 8, 9
- Node 7 has neighbors: 1, 2
- Node 8 has neighbors: 4, 6
- Node 9 has neighbors: 0, 1, 4, 6

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up all the 3-stars from the above calculations, we get a total of 14 3-stars in this graph.

Therefore, the final result is: \[ [14] \]

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <0, (2, 3, 9)>
- <1, (2, 7, 9)>
- <1, (3, 6, 9)>
- <2, (0, 1, 5)>
- <6, (3, 5, 8)>
- <9, (0, 1, 4)>
