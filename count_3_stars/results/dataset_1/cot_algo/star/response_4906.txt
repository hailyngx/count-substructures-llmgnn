Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 24 edges, we can first list the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {4, 9}
- Node 1: {4}
- Node 2: {3, 4}
- Node 3: {2, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 2, 3, 8}
- Node 5: {3, 7}
- Node 6: {3, 9}
- Node 7: {5, 9}
- Node 8: {4}
- Node 9: {0, 6, 7}

Next, we'll identify the 3-stars formed by each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 3 forms a 3-star with leaves: <3, (2, 4, 5)>, <3, (2, 4, 6)>, <3, (2, 4, 8)>, <3, (4, 5, 6)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with leaves: <4, (0, 1, 3)>, <4, (0, 2, 3)>, <4, (0, 3, 8)>, <4, (1, 2, 3)>, <4, (1, 3, 8)>, <4, (2, 3, 8)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with leaves: <9, (0, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [10].
The unique 3-stars found are: <3, (2, 4, 5)>, <3, (2, 4, 6)>, <3, (2, 4, 8)>, <3, (4, 5, 6)>, <4, (0, 1, 3)>, <4, (0, 2, 3)>, <4, (0, 3, 8)>, <4, (1, 2, 3)>, <4, (1, 3, 8)>, <4, (2, 3, 8)>, <9, (0, 6, 7)>.
