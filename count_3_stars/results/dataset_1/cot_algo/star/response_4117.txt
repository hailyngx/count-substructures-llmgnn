Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 3, 4, 5
- Node 1: 3, 9
- Node 2: 6, 8
- Node 3: 0, 1, 7, 8
- Node 4: 0
- Node 5: 0, 6
- Node 6: 2, 5
- Node 7: 3, 8, 9
- Node 8: 2, 3, 7
- Node 9: 1, 7

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (1 3-star)
- Node 1: Not enough neighbors for a 3-star
- Node 2: Not enough neighbors for a 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (4 3-stars: <3, (0, 1, 7)>, <3, (0, 1, 8)>, <3, (1, 7, 8)>, <3, (7, 8, 9)>)
- Node 4: Not enough neighbors for a 3-star
- Node 5: Not enough neighbors for a 3-star
- Node 6: Not enough neighbors for a 3-star
- Node 7: Not enough neighbors for a 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (1 3-star)
- Node 9: Not enough neighbors for a 3-star

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 1 = 6  
Thus, the final answer is [6].  
The unique 3-stars found are:  
<3, (0, 1, 7)>  
<3, (0, 1, 8)>  
<3, (1, 7, 8)>  
<3, (7, 8, 9)>  
<0, (3, 4, 5)>  
<8, (2, 3, 7)>
