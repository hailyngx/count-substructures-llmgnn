Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 4
Node 1: 3, 4, 5, 7, 9
Node 2: 4, 5, 6, 7, 9
Node 3: 1, 5, 6, 7
Node 4: 0, 1, 2, 6, 8
Node 5: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9
Node 6: 2, 3, 4, 5
Node 7: 1, 2, 3
Node 8: 4
Node 9: 1, 2, 5

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (3, 5, 9)>
Node 2 forms a 3-star: <2, (4, 6, 9)>
Node 5 forms a 3-star: <5, (1, 2, 9)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
