Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The adjacency list for the given graph is as follows:
- Node 0: 6
- Node 1: 2, 6, 7
- Node 2: 1, 3, 8
- Node 3: 2, 5, 6
- Node 5: 3, 6, 8, 9
- Node 6: 0, 1, 3, 5, 8, 9
- Node 7: 1
- Node 8: 2, 5, 6
- Node 9: 5, 6

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (2, 6, 7)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star: <2, (1, 3, 8)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star: <3, (2, 5, 6)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star: <5, (3, 6, 8)>, <5, (6, 8, 9)>
- Node 6 forms four 3-stars: <6, (1, 3, 5)>, <6, (1, 5, 8)>, <6, (3, 5, 8)>, <6, (5, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 4] = [9].
