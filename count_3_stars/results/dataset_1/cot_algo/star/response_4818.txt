Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The neighbors for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 3
- Node 1: 0, 3, 5, 7
- Node 2: 3
- Node 3: 0, 1, 2, 6
- Node 5: 1, 9
- Node 6: 3, 9
- Node 7: 1, 9
- Node 9: 5, 6, 7

Now, we can determine the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.

Adding these up, we have a total of 4 + 4 + 1 = 9 3-stars. Thus, the answer is [9].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (0, 5, 7)>, <1, (0, 7, 9)>, <1, (3, 5, 7)>, <1, (3, 5, 9)>, <3, (0, 1, 6)>, <3, (0, 2, 6)>, <3, (1, 5, 6)>, <3, (1, 6, 9)>, <9, (5, 6, 7)>
