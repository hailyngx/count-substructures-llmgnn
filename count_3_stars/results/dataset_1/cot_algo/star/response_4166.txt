Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 5
- Node 1: 0, 2, 4, 8, 9
- Node 2: 1, 7
- Node 3: 4, 8
- Node 4: 1, 3, 6, 9
- Node 5: 0
- Node 6: 4, 9
- Node 7: 2
- Node 8: 1, 3, 9
- Node 9: 1, 4, 6, 8

Next, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars.
- Node 1, 4, and 9 have 5 neighbors each, forming \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars for each of them.

So, the total number of 3-stars is \( [10 + 10 + 10] = [30] \).

The unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (0, 4, 9)>
- <4, (1, 3, 9)>
- <9, (1, 4, 8)>
