Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {2, 4}
- Node 1: Neighbors {3, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 4, 6}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {3, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors {2, 4, 5}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 3, 5, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 3, 5, 7}
- Node 9: Neighbors {3, 4, 5}

Now, let's identify the central nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, total 3-stars in the graph are \( [4 + 20 + 20 + 10 + 4] = 58 \).

The unique 3-star configurations are:
- <1, (3, 7, 8)>
- <3, (1, 5, 8)>
- <4, (0, 6, 9)>
- <5, (3, 6, 9)>
