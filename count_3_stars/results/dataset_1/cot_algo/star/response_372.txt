Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 6, 9
- Node 1: 0, 2, 6
- Node 2: 1, 6, 7
- Node 3: 0
- Node 4: 6
- Node 6: 0, 1, 2, 4
- Node 7: 2
- Node 8: 9
- Node 9: 0, 8

Next, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 10

Therefore, the final answer is [10] and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (1, 6, 9)>
- <1, (0, 2, 6)>
- <2, (1, 6, 7)>
- <6, (0, 1, 2)>
- <6, (0, 2, 4)>
- <6, (1, 2, 4)>
- <6, (0, 1, 4)>
- <6, (0, 1, 2)>
