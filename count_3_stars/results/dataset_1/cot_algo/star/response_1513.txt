Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 3, 5
- Node 1: 3, 4, 8, 9
- Node 2: 5, 8
- Node 3: 0, 1, 5, 9
- Node 4: 1, 5
- Node 5: 0, 2, 3, 4
- Node 7: 8, 9
- Node 8: 1, 2, 7, 9
- Node 9: 1, 3, 7, 8

Next, let's identify 3-star formations:
- Node 1, with neighbors 3, 4, 8, 9, forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3, with neighbors 0, 1, 5, 9, forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5, with neighbors 0, 2, 3, 4, forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8, with neighbors 1, 2, 7, 9, forms 2 3-stars.
- Node 9, with neighbors 1, 3, 7, 8, forms 2 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: [1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2] = [7]

Unique 3-stars:
<1, (3, 4, 8)>
<3, (0, 1, 5)>
<5, (0, 2, 3)>
<8, (1, 2, 7)>
<8, (1, 7, 9)>
<9, (1, 3, 7)>
<9, (1, 8, 3)>
