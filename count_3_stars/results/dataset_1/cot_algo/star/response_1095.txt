Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 3, 6, 7, 9
- Node 1: 6
- Node 2: 4, 5, 8
- Node 3: 0, 6
- Node 4: 2, 5, 7
- Node 5: 2, 4, 6, 7, 9
- Node 6: 0, 1, 3, 5
- Node 7: 0, 4, 5
- Node 8: 2, 9
- Node 9: 0, 5, 8

Next, we will check each node to see if it forms a 3-star:
- Node 0: Forms a 3-star with neighbors (3, 6, 7) and (3, 6, 9) -> Total: 2
- Node 2: Forms a 3-star with neighbors (4, 5, 7) -> Total: 1
- Node 4: Forms a 3-star with neighbors (2, 5, 7) -> Total: 1
- Node 5: Forms a 3-star with neighbors (2, 4, 6), (2, 4, 7), (2, 6, 7), (4, 6, 7) -> Total: 4

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 8, and they are:
<0, (3, 6, 7)>, <0, (3, 6, 9)>, <2, (4, 5, 7)>, <4, (2, 5, 7)>, <5, (2, 4, 6)>, <5, (2, 4, 7)>, <5, (2, 6, 7)>, <5, (4, 6, 7)>.

So, the final answer is [8].
