Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 8) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to determine the neighbors of each node:

Node 0 neighbors: 4, 6, 9
Node 1 neighbors: 4, 5, 9
Node 2 neighbors: 3
Node 3 neighbors: 2, 5
Node 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 5, 9
Node 5 neighbors: 1, 3, 4, 9
Node 6 neighbors: 0, 8
Node 8 neighbors: 6
Node 9 neighbors: 0, 1, 4, 5

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0: {4, 6, 9}
- Node 1: {4, 5, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 5}         (We have \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star)
- Node 5: {1, 3, 4}, {1, 4, 9}, {3, 4, 9}, {4, 5, 9}   (We have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars)
- Node 9: {0, 1, 4}, {0, 4, 5}, {1, 4, 5}   (We have \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star)

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [1 + 4 + 1] = 6 \).

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (4, 6, 9)>
- <1, (4, 5, 9)>
- <4, (0, 1, 5)>
- <5, (1, 3, 4)>
- <5, (1, 4, 9)>
- <5, (3, 4, 9)>
- <5, (4, 5, 9)>
- <9, (0, 1, 4)>
- <9, (0, 4, 5)>
- <9, (1, 4, 5)>
