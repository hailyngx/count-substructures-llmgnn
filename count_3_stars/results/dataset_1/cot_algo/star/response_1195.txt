Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first determine the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {4, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {3, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {3, 5, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 2}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 2, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 4, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 1, 2, 5, 8}

Now let's identify the 3-stars in the graph.

- Node 0: It has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars:
  <0, (4, 6, 8)>, <0, (4, 6, 9)>, <0, (4, 8, 9)>, <0, (6, 8, 9)>

- Node 1: It has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars:
  <1, (3, 5, 7)>, <1, (3, 5, 9)>, <1, (3, 7, 9)>, <1, (5, 7, 9)>

- Node 5: It has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars:
  <5, (1, 2, 8)>, <5, (1, 4, 8)>, <5, (1, 8, 9)>, <5, (2, 4, 8)>, <5, (2, 8, 9)>,
  <5, (4, 6, 8)>, <5, (4, 8, 9)>, <5, (4, 5, 8)>, <5, (6, 8, 9)>, <5, (8, 9, 4)>

- Node 8: It has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars:
  <8, (0, 4, 5)>, <8, (0, 4, 6)>, <8, (0, 4, 8)>, <8, (0, 4, 9)>, <8, (0, 5, 6)>,
  <8, (0, 5, 8)>, <8, (0, 5, 9)>, <8, (0, 6, 8)>, <8, (0, 6, 9)>, <8, (0, 8, 9)>,
  <8, (4, 5, 6)>, <8, (4, 5, 8)>, <8, (4, 5, 9)>, <8, (4, 6, 8)>, <8, (4, 6, 9)>,
  <8, (4, 8, 9)>, <8, (5, 6, 8)>, <8, (5, 8, 9)>, <8, (6, 8, 9)>, <8, (6, 5, 8)>

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
\( [4 + 4 + 10 + 20] = [38] \)
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 38.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (4, 6, 8)>, <0, (4, 6, 9)>, <0, (4, 8, 9)>, <0, (6, 8, 9)>,
<1, (3, 5, 7)>, <1, (3, 5, 9)>, <1, (3, 7, 9)>, <1, (5, 7, 9)>,
<5, (1, 2, 8)>, <5, (1, 4, 8)>, <5, (1, 8, 9)>, <5, (2, 4, 8)>, <5, (2, 8, 9)>,
<5, (4, 6, 8)>, <5, (4, 8, 9)>, <5, (4, 5, 8)>, <5, (6, 8, 9)>, <5, (8, 9, 4)>,
<8, (0, 4, 5)>, <8, (0, 4, 6)>, <8, (0, 4, 8)>, <8, (0, 4, 9)>, <8, (0, 5, 6)>,
<8, (0, 5, 8)>, <8, (0, 5, 9)>, <8, (0, 6, 8)>, <8, (0, 6, 9)>, <8, (0, 8, 9)>,
<8, (4, 5, 6)>, <8, (4, 5, 8)>, <8, (4, 5, 9)>, <8, (4, 6, 8)>, <8, (4, 6, 9)>,
<8, (4, 8, 9)>, <8, (5, 6, 8)>, <8, (5, 8, 9)>, <8, (6, 8, 9)>, <8, (6, 5, 8)>
