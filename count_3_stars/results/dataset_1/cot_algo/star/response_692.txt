Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph visually:

```
   0 --- 5           6 --- 9
    \     \         /     /
     \     \       /     /
       4 --- 2 --- 3 --- 7 --- 8
            |   |   |   |   |
            5   6   7   9   6
```

After examining the neighbors for each node, we find:
- Node 0: Neighbors {5} - Forms 0 3-stars.
- Node 2: Neighbors {3, 4, 5, 7, 8} - Forms 10 3-stars.
- Node 3: Neighbors {2, 6, 7, 8} - Forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 4: Neighbors {2, 5, 6} - Forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 2, 4, 7, 8} - Forms 10 3-stars.
- Node 6: Neighbors {3, 4, 9} - Forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7: Neighbors {2, 3, 5, 9} - Forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8: Neighbors {2, 3, 5} - Forms 1 3-star.
- Node 9: Neighbors {6, 7} - Forms 0 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [27], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <2, (3, 5, 7)>
- <2, (3, 5, 8)>
- <2, (4, 5, 7)>
- <2, (4, 5, 8)>
- <3, (2, 5, 7)>
- <3, (2, 5, 8)>
- <5, (2, 3, 7)>
- <5, (2, 3, 8)>
- <5, (2, 4, 7)>
- <5, (2, 4, 8)>
