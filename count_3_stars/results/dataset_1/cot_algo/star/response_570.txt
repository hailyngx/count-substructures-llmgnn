Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 2, 5
- Node 2: 0, 7, 8, 9
- Node 3: 4, 8
- Node 4: 3, 8
- Node 5: 0
- Node 7: 2, 8
- Node 8: 2, 3, 4, 7
- Node 9: 2

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 2 has inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 8 has inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 = 8

Therefore, the final result is [8] with the unique 3-stars being:
<2, (0, 7, 9)>
<8, (2, 3, 4)>
<8, (2, 3, 7)>
<8, (2, 4, 7)>
<8, (3, 4, 7)>
