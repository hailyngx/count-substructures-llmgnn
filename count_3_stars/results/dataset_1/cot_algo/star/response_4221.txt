Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 3) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 20 edges, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

1. Node 1: Neighbors {0, 2, 4, 9}
   - <1, (0, 2, 4)>
   - <1, (0, 2, 9)>
   - <1, (0, 4, 9)>
   - <1, (2, 4, 9)>

2. Node 2: Neighbors {1, 3, 6}
   - <2, (1, 3, 6)>

3. Node 3: Neighbors {2, 6, 8, 9}
   - <3, (2, 6, 8)>
   - <3, (2, 6, 9)>
   - <3, (2, 8, 9)>
   - <3, (6, 8, 9)>

4. Node 4: Neighbors {1, 5}
   - No 3-star formed.

5. Node 5: Neighbors {4}
   - No 3-star formed.

6. Node 6: Neighbors {2, 3}
   - No 3-star formed.

7. Node 8: Neighbors {3}
   - No 3-star formed.

8. Node 9: Neighbors {1, 3}
   - No 3-star formed.

Total number of 3-stars = [10].

3-stars: <1, (0, 2, 4)>, <1, (0, 2, 9)>, <1, (0, 4, 9)>, <1, (2, 4, 9)>, <2, (1, 3, 6)>, <3, (2, 6, 8)>, <3, (2, 6, 9)>, <3, (2, 8, 9)>, <3, (6, 8, 9)>.
