Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 6, 7
- Node 1: 5, 7
- Node 3: 4, 6, 7, 9
- Node 4: 3, 6, 8
- Node 5: 1, 8
- Node 6: 0, 3, 4
- Node 7: 0, 1, 3
- Node 8: 4, 5
- Node 9: 3

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- For Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, there are a total of \( [4 + 1 + 1 + 1] = 7 \) 3-stars in the graph. The unique 3-stars are:
- <3, (4, 6, 7)>
- <4, (3, 6, 8)>
- <6, (0, 3, 4)>
- <7, (0, 1, 3)>
