Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 22 edges, we can first identify the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {3, 5, 7}
- Node 1: Neighbors {4, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {5, 6}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 4}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 3, 6}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 2, 8}
- Node 6: Neighbors {2, 4}
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbor {5}
- Node 9: Neighbors {1, 7}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with at least 3 neighbors:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so no 3-star.
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star.
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star.
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star.
- Node 8 has 1 neighbor, so no 3-star.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars: [2]

Unique 3-stars found: <4, (1, 3, 6)>, <5, (0, 2, 8)>
