Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: (1, 4, 5, 7, 9)
- Node 1: (0, 3, 4, 9)
- Node 2: (4, 7)
- Node 3: (1, 8)
- Node 4: (0, 1, 2, 6, 8, 9)
- Node 5: (0, 9)
- Node 6: (4, 7)
- Node 7: (0, 2, 6, 9)
- Node 8: (3, 4, 9)
- Node 9: (0, 1, 4, 5, 7, 8)

Now, we'll identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 0: 1 3-star (0, 1, 4)
- Node 1: 1 3-star (1, 4, 9)
- Node 4: 4 3-stars (4, 0, 1), (4, 0, 9), (4, 1, 9), (4, 8, 9)
- Node 9: 1 3-star (9, 1, 4)

Total number of 3-stars = 7

Thus, the final answer is [7] and the unique 3-stars found are <0, (1, 4)>, <1, (4, 9)>, <4, (0, 1)>, <4, (0, 9)>, <4, (1, 9)>, <4, (8, 9)>, <9, (1, 4)>.
