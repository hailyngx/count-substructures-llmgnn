Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 6, 9
- Node 1: 4, 9
- Node 2: 6, 7
- Node 3: 6, 9
- Node 4: 1, 7
- Node 6: 0, 2, 3
- Node 7: 2, 4, 9
- Node 9: 0, 1, 3, 7

Now, we will check the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 0: 1 3-star
- Node 1: 1 3-star
- Node 2: 1 3-star
- Node 3: 1 3-star
- Node 4: 0 3-stars
- Node 6: 1 3-star
- Node 7: 1 3-star
- Node 9: 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6
So, the total number of 3-stars is [6].

The unique 3-stars formed are:
- <0, (6, 9)>
- <1, (4, 9)>
- <2, (6, 7)>
- <3, (6, 9)>
- <6, (0, 2, 3)>
- <7, (2, 4, 9)>
