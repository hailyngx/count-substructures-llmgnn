Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: 3, 9
- Node 1: 6
- Node 2: 4, 6, 9
- Node 3: 0, 7
- Node 4: 2, 5, 6, 7
- Node 5: 4
- Node 6: 1, 2, 4
- Node 7: 3, 4, 8, 9
- Node 8: 7
- Node 9: 0, 2, 7

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 7 forms a 3-star with leaves 4, 8, 9: <7, (4, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1].
