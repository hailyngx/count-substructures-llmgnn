Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 5
- Node 1: 0, 3
- Node 2: 3, 4, 9
- Node 3: 0, 1, 2, 6, 9
- Node 4: 2, 9
- Node 5: 0
- Node 6: 3, 7, 8
- Node 7: 6, 8
- Node 8: 6, 7, 9
- Node 9: 2, 3, 4, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star: <0, (1, 3, 5)>
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star: <3, (0, 1, 2)>
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star: <6, (7, 8, 3)>
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star: <8, (6, 7, 9)>
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star: <9, (2, 4, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
