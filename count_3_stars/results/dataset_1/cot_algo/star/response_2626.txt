Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The 3-star graph can be analyzed based on the given edge connections. 

Let's first determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 3, 5}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 3, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 6, 7}
- Node 4: {0}
- Node 5: {1, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 3, 5, 7}
- Node 7: {2, 3, 5, 6}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 5, 8}

Now, we can identify the number of 3-star configurations for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 20 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 = 52, which we'll represent as [52].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
- <0, (1, 2, 8)>
- <0, (1, 2, 9)>
- <0, (1, 4, 6)>
- <0, (1, 6, 8)>
- <0, (1, 6, 9)>
- <0, (2, 8, 9)>
- <1, (0, 2, 3)>
- <2, (0, 1, 3)>
- <2, (0, 3, 7)>
- <2, (0, 7, 8)>
- <2, (0, 7, 9)>
- <5, (1, 6, 7)>
- <5, (1, 7, 9)>
- <5, (6, 7, 9)>
- <9, (0, 2, 5)>
