Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's first determine the neighborhood sets for each node:

Node 0: {7, 9}
Node 1: {4}
Node 2: {4, 9}
Node 3: {4}
Node 4: {1, 2, 3, 7}
Node 5: {9}
Node 6: {9}
Node 7: {0, 4}
Node 9: {0, 2, 5, 6}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:

Node 0: inom{2}{3} = 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
Node 1: inom{0}{3} = 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
Node 2: inom{2}{3} = 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
Node 3: inom{0}{3} = 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
Node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4 (1 unique 3-star)
Node 5: inom{1}{3} = 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
Node 6: inom{1}{3} = 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
Node 7: inom{1}{3} = 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
Node 9: inom{4}{3} = 4 (1 unique 3-star)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<4, (1, 2, 3)>
<9, (0, 2, 6)>
