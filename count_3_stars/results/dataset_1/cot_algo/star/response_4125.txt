Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 3, 5
- Node 1: 3, 7
- Node 2: 4
- Node 3: 0, 1, 6, 8, 9
- Node 4: 2, 5, 7, 9
- Node 5: 0, 4, 7
- Node 6: 3, 8
- Node 7: 1, 4, 5, 8, 9
- Node 8: 3, 6, 7
- Node 9: 3, 4, 7

Now, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars:
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with neighbors 1, 7, 9
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with neighbors 5, 7, 9
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with neighbors 0, 4, 7
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with neighbors 1, 4, 8
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with neighbors 3, 4, 7

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- 5 unique 3-stars are formed

So, the final answer is:
[5]
<3, (1, 7, 9)>, <4, (5, 7, 9)>, <5, (0, 4, 7)>, <7, (1, 4, 8)>, <9, (3, 4, 7)>
