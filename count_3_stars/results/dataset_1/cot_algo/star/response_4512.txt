Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 6, 7
- Node 1: 0, 2, 4, 8
- Node 2: 0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 8
- Node 3: 0, 2, 9
- Node 4: 1, 5
- Node 5: 2, 4
- Node 6: 0, 2, 7
- Node 7: 0, 6
- Node 8: 1, 2, 9
- Node 9: 3, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
    - <0, (1, 2, 3)>
    - <0, (1, 2, 6)>
    - <0, (1, 2, 7)>
    - <0, (1, 3, 6)>
    - <0, (1, 3, 7)>
    - <0, (1, 6, 7)>
    - <0, (2, 3, 6)>
    - <0, (2, 3, 7)>
    - <0, (2, 6, 7)>
    - <0, (3, 6, 7)>
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
    - <1, (0, 2, 4)>
- Node 2 has 6 neighbors, so it can form inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars.
    - <2, (0, 1, 3)>
    - <2, (0, 1, 5)>
    - <2, (0, 1, 6)>
    - <2, (0, 1, 8)>
    - <2, (0, 3, 5)>
    - <2, (0, 3, 6)>
    - <2, (0, 3, 8)>
    - <2, (0, 5, 6)>
    - <2, (0, 5, 8)>
    - <2, (0, 6, 8)>
    - <2, (1, 3, 5)>
    - <2, (1, 3, 8)>
    - <2, (1, 5, 8)>
    - <2, (3, 5, 6)>
    - <2, (3, 5, 8)>
    - <2, (3, 6, 8)>
    - <2, (5, 6, 8)>
    - <2, (6, 7, 8)>
    - <2, (6, 8, 9)>
    - <2, (7, 8, 9)>
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: [10 + 1 + 20] = 31

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (1, 2, 3)>, <0, (1, 2, 6)>, <0, (1, 2, 7)>, <0, (1, 3, 6)>, <0, (1, 3, 7)>, <0, (1, 6, 7)>, 
<0, (2, 3, 6)>, <0, (2, 3, 7)>, <0, (2, 6, 7)>, <0, (3, 6, 7)>, 
<1, (0, 2, 4)>, 
<2, (0, 1, 3)>, <2, (0, 1, 5)>, <2, (0, 1, 6)>, <2, (0, 1, 8)>, <2, (0, 3, 5)>, <2, (0, 3, 6)>, <2, (0, 3, 8)>, 
<2, (0, 5, 6)>, <2, (0, 5, 8)>, <2, (0, 6, 8)>, <2, (1, 3, 5)>, <2, (1, 3, 8)>, <2, (1, 5, 8)>, 
<2, (3, 5, 6)>, <2, (3, 5, 8)>, <2, (3, 6, 8)>, <2, (5, 6, 8)>, <2, (6, 7, 8)>, <2, (6, 8, 9)>, <2, (7, 8, 9)>
