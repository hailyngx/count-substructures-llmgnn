Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: neighbors {1, 2}
- Node 1: neighbors {0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 2: neighbors {0, 1, 6}
- Node 3: neighbors {1, 4}
- Node 4: neighbors {1, 3, 7, 9}
- Node 5: neighbor {1}
- Node 6: neighbors {1, 2, 9}
- Node 7: neighbors {1, 4, 9}
- Node 9: neighbors {4, 6, 7}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars by checking the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: inom{7}{3} = 35
- Node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 6: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 7: inom{3}{3} = 1
So, the total number of 3-stars is [35 + 4 + 1 + 1] = 41.

The unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (2, 4, 7)>
- <1, (3, 4, 7)>
- <1, (4, 6, 7)>
- <1, (5, 6, 7)>
- <1, (4, 6, 9)>
- <1, (5, 6, 9)>
- <1, (4, 7, 9)>
- <1, (5, 7, 9)>
