Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 1: 0, 3, 8
- Node 2: 0, 3, 5, 6, 8
- Node 3: 0, 1, 2, 8
- Node 4: 0, 9
- Node 5: 2, 7
- Node 6: 0, 2
- Node 7: 5
- Node 8: 0, 1, 2, 3, 9
- Node 9: 0, 4, 8

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they form:
- Node 0: 3-star formed with (1, 4, 6), (1, 8, 9), (2, 8, 9), (3, 4, 9) -> Total: 4
- Node 2: 3-star formed with (0, 3, 8), (0, 6, 8), (0, 8, 9), (3, 6, 8) -> Total: 4
- Node 3: 3-star formed with (0, 8, 9) -> Total: 1
- Node 8: 3-star formed with (0, 1, 9), (0, 2, 9), (0, 3, 9) -> Total: 3

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4+4+1+3] = 12.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (1, 4, 6)>
- <0, (1, 8, 9)>
- <0, (2, 8, 9)>
- <0, (3, 4, 9)>
- <2, (0, 3, 8)>
- <2, (0, 6, 8)>
- <2, (0, 8, 9)>
- <2, (3, 6, 8)>
- <3, (0, 8, 9)>
- <8, (0, 1, 9)>
- <8, (0, 2, 9)>
- <8, (0, 3, 9)>
