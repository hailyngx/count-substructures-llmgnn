Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The neighbor sets for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: {2, 6}
- Node 1: {2, 5, 7}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 3: {2, 4}
- Node 4: {3, 7}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {0}
- Node 7: {1, 4, 5}
- Node 8: {9}
- Node 9: {2, 5, 8}

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding all the 3-stars together, we get a total of 17 3-stars. 

Therefore, the final answer is [17], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (2, 5, 7)>
- <2, (1, 5, 9)>
- <5, (1, 2, 7)>
- <7, (1, 4, 5)>
- <9, (2, 5, 8)>
