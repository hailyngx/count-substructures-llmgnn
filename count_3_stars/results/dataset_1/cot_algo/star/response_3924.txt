Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, we need to identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: neighbor(7)
- Node 1: neighbor(3, 7)
- Node 2: neighbor(3, 4, 7)
- Node 3: neighbor(1, 2, 7, 9)
- Node 4: neighbor(2, 7, 9)
- Node 5: neighbor(7, 9)
- Node 6: neighbor(9)
- Node 7: neighbor(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
- Node 9: neighbor(3, 4, 5, 6)

Next, we'll identify the 3-stars:
- Node 2 has 3 or more neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars. 
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 6 neighbors, so it forms 20 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 20 + 4 = 30
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [30].

The unique 3-stars are:
<2, (3, 7, 9)>
<3, (1, 2, 7)>
<3, (1, 4, 7)>
<3, (2, 4, 7)>
<3, (5, 7, 9)>
<7, (0, 1, 3)>
<7, (0, 2, 3)>
<7, (0, 3, 4)>
<7, (0, 3, 9)>
<7, (0, 4, 9)>
<7, (0, 5, 9)>
<7, (1, 2, 4)>
<7, (1, 2, 9)>
<7, (1, 4, 9)>
<7, (1, 5, 9)>
<7, (2, 4, 9)>
<7, (2, 5, 9)>
<7, (3, 4, 9)>
<9, (3, 4, 5)>
<9, (3, 4, 6)>
<9, (3, 5, 6)>
<9, (4, 5, 6)>
