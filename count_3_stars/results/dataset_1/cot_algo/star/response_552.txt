Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: {7, 8}
- Node 1: {3, 4}
- Node 2: {7}
- Node 3: {1, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {6, 7}
- Node 6: {5}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 5, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 4}
- Node 9: {3, 4, 7}

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars centered at each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: No 3-star as it has only 2 neighbors.
- Node 1: No 3-star as it has only 2 neighbors.
- Node 2: No 3-star as it has only 1 neighbor.
- Node 3: No 3-star as it has only 2 neighbors.
- Node 4: No 3-star as it has only 3 neighbors. (1 3-star)
- Node 5: No 3-star as it has only 2 neighbors.
- Node 6: No 3-star as it has only 1 neighbor.
- Node 7: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: No 3-star as it has only 2 neighbors. 
- Node 9: \( inom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: \( [4 + 1] = 5 \)

Unique 3-stars:
- <4, (1, 8, 9)>
- <7, (0, 2, 5)>
- <7, (0, 5, 9)>
- <7, (2, 5, 9)>
- <9, (3, 4, 7)>
