Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 7
- Node 1: 0, 2, 5, 8
- Node 2: 1, 3, 8
- Node 3: 0, 2
- Node 4: 5, 6
- Node 5: 1, 4, 6
- Node 6: 4, 5, 9
- Node 7: 0
- Node 8: 1, 2
- Node 9: 6

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each eligible node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 8, which we will represent as [8].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 3, 7)>
<1, (0, 2, 5)>
<1, (0, 5, 8)>
<1, (2, 5, 8)>
<2, (1, 3, 8)>
<5, (1, 4, 6)>
<6, (4, 5, 9)>
<6, (5, 9, 4)>
