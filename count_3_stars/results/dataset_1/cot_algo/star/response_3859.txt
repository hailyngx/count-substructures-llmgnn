Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list all the adjacent nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 5, 8
- Node 1: 5, 7, 8
- Node 2: 3, 4, 5, 8
- Node 3: 2, 6, 8
- Node 4: 2, 8
- Node 5: 0, 1, 2, 6
- Node 6: 3, 5, 8
- Node 7: 1
- Node 8: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9
- Node 9: 8

Now, let's identify the nodes with at least 3 neighbors:
- Node 1, Node 2, Node 3, Node 5, Node 6, Node 8

Calculating the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 35 = 46

Therefore, the final answer is [46] and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (5, 7, 8)>, <2, (3, 4, 5)>, <2, (3, 5, 6)>, <2, (4, 5, 6)>, <2, (4, 5, 8)>, <5, (0, 2, 6)>, <5, (1, 2, 6)>, <5, (1, 2, 8)>, <5, (2, 0, 6)>, <6, (3, 5, 8)>, <8, (0, 1, 2)>, <8, (0, 1, 6)>, <8, (0, 2, 6)>, <8, (1, 2, 6)>, <8, (1, 5, 6)>, <8, (2, 3, 8)>, <8, (2, 4, 8)>, <8, (2, 5, 6)>, <8, (2, 5, 8)>, <8, (3, 6, 8)>, <8, (4, 5, 8)>, <8, (4, 6, 8)>, <8, (5, 0, 6)>, <8, (5, 1, 6)>, <8, (5, 2, 6)>, <8, (5, 2, 8)>, <8, (6, 3, 8)>, <8, (6, 5, 8)>, <8, (9, 0, 1)>, <8, (9, 0, 2)>, <8, (9, 1, 2)>
