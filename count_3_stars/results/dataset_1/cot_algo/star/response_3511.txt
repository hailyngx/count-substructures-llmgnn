Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 1, 4, 7
Node 1: 0
Node 2: 7, 9
Node 3: 5, 8
Node 4: 0, 5, 6, 9
Node 5: 3, 4
Node 6: 4, 9
Node 7: 0, 2, 8
Node 8: 3, 7
Node 9: 2, 4, 6

Next, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with three or more neighbors:

Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 2: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 7: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 3, and they are:

<0, (1, 4, 7)>
<4, (0, 5, 6)>
<9, (2, 4, 6)>
